    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I documents Hunter Reynolds' Memorial Dress project, spanning the years 1992-2010. The series includes material related to the construction and exhibition of his Memorial Dress -- a black ball gown silk-screened with the names of 25,000 people who died of AIDS. Exhibitions of the dress were modeled by Reynolds in character as his alter ego, Patina du Prey. The Memorial Dress was premiered in 1992 at the ICA of Boston, was presented during the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, and produced in collaboration with The Contemporary Art Institute of New York. The material documents the conception and exhibition of the Memorial Dress in the U.S. and internationally, and includes press, production material, exhibition files, and the dress itself.</field>
