    <field name="abstract_teim">Thom Fogarty has been a part of New York City's Downtown theater community since the 1970s.  As a dancer and choreographer Fogarty has been known for portraying theatrical characters through mimetic movements. Since 2010 he has focused more on directing and producing theater, and is currently the Artistic Director of 360repco. This collection consists of materials created and collected by Fogarty in the early 1990s documenting his direct action advocacy efforts to positively impact the lives of people with AIDS and to further legislative, scientific research, and medical treatment measures to end the disease. Materials in this collection include news articles, meeting notes, meeting agendas, and ephemera from the advocacy group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) documenting the organization's efforts to raise awareness of the AIDS pandemic both in the greater New York City area and more broadly domestically. The collection also documents medical research and drug trials, including articles on new pharmaceutical products, documentation on a 1990 Ampligen drug trial that Fogarty acted as liason for with the pharmaceutical company, and materials collected from conferences on clinical trials and developments in medial treatments that Fogarty attended.</field>
