    <field name="abstract_teim">Mark Mothersbaugh is a singer, composer, record producer, author, and visual artist. Mothersbaugh co-founded the band Devo in 1973 with Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis, based on a satirical concept of the "de-evolution" and regression of humanity. The band's music, stage presence, and music videos combined pop sensibilities and synth instrumentation with social commentary, surrealist humor, and science fiction themes. Mothersbaugh has also composed numerous musical scores for film, television, commercials, and video games, in particular children's television shows and collaborations with director Wes Anderson. In addition to his musical career, Mothersbaugh is also a visual artist, with the notable touring retrospective in 2014, "Mark Mothersbaugh: Myopia." This collection consists of scores used in a live performance of Mothersbaugh's "Music for Six-Sided Keyboard," which took place at the NYU Skirball Center on May 4, 2017, as part of the Grey Art Gallery's programming for the "Myopia" exhibition.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mark Mothersbaugh (1950- ) is a singer, composer, record producer, author, and visual artist. He was born in Akron, Ohio and attended Kent State University to study art. Mothersbaugh co-founded the band Devo in 1973 with Gerald Casale and Bob Lewis, based on a satirical concept of the "de-evolution" and regression of humanity. The band's music, stage presence, and music videos combined pop sensibilities and synth instrumentation with social commentary, surrealist humor, and science fiction themes. Mothersbaugh has also composed numerous musical scores for film, television, commercials, and video games, in particular children's television shows and collaborations with director Wes Anderson. In addition to his musical career, Mothersbaugh is also a visual artist, with the notable touring retrospective in 2014, "Mark Mothersbaugh: Myopia." The exhibition was accompanied by a publication of the same name published by Princeton Architectural Press.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Transferred by the Grey Art Gallery in August 2017; the accession number associated with this gift is 2017.187.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The scores that comprise this collection were printed for use in the live performance on May 4, 2017 at the NYU Skirball Center as part of the Grey Art Gallery's programming for the exhibition "Mark Mothersbaugh: Myopia." After the performance, Mothersbaugh gathered the scores together and gifted them to the Grey Gallery, who later transferred them to the Fales Library in August 2017.
They arrived to Fales on August 8th, 2017. At the end of the live performance, Mothersbaugh threw a portion of the scores into the audience and gave signed pages from the scores to each of the performers, which may explain why the collection does not contain scores for each piece of the performance.</field>
