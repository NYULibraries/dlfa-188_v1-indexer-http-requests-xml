    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Fugs Archive consists of correspondence, manuscripts, flyers, newsclippings, and publications dating between 1963-1971. Also includes their archived website collected from 2010-2017.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Fugs, a group of poet-musicians, were virtually conceived and developed on the off-Broadway stage. They performed first at the Bridge Theater. After a run of a full two weeks, Ed Sanders, poet, editor, owner of the fabled Peace Eye Book Store and leader of the group, decided the show was ready for a cross-country tour. In a borrowed Volkswagen bus, the Fugs stormed suprised academies from the Kinsey Institute in Bloomington, Indiana to the University of Kansas and on to Berkeley.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Fugs satirized everything from political involvement and patriotism to rock and roll, from war and hate to super-abundant love. The Fugs performed about 15 of their 110 songs per show and presented 12 shows a week during their theater runs. Rather than object to the rigor of the long run, they became more and more intrigued by the possibibilities of the theater through constantly changing and adding to their repertoire. The Fugs were an ever-evolving improvisational review.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Fugs consisted of three members: Tuli Kupferberg, native New Yorker and "one of the leading Anarchist theorists of our time," Ken Weaver, humorist and poet, and Ed Sanders, poet and leader of the group.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The Fugs Archive was purchased from Richard Aaron of Am Here Books in February 1975. The accession number associated with this collection is 1975.013.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">http://www.thefugs.com/ was initially selected by Tamiment curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in 2010 as part of the Arts and Cultural Left Web Archive.  In November 2015, the website was migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2017, http://www.thefugs.com/ was transferred to Fales Library.</field>
