    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Department of Music at Washington Square was established in 1923 with Albert Stoessel as Acting Chairman, under the deanship of James Buell Munn, then Dean of Washington Square College, to serve both the Washington Square College and the College of Arts and Science at the University Heights campus. Stoessel supervised the Heights music programs and Philip James was assigned to Washington Square College. For a period of four years between 1931 and 1935, the Music Department at the Square was transferred to a short-lived College of Fine Arts located in midtown. In 1935, the College was dissolved and the Department was returned to the Washington Square College. During this period, Alfred Greenfield was appointed Chairman at University Heights, which continued to offer a purely undergraduate curriculum with a B.A. in Liberal Arts. This satellite program was dissolved and moved with the rest of the University Heights College in 1972 to the Square.</field>
