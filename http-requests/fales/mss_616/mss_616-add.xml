    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection contains websites related to Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.), mostly documenting their web presence from 2015-2017. W.A.G.E. was established in 2008, to work for fair and regulated compensation for visual and performing artists in the non-profit arts institutions. The majority of their work operates around their W.A.G.E certification program and WAGENCY. The website includes historical information about the organzation; members of the certification program and how to become a member; and events, writings, and videos highlighting their activist work pressuring arts organizations to pay their freelance artists equitably.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains websites related to Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.), mostly documenting their web presence from 2015-2017. The website contains information on their wo/manifesto; mission; history of the organization and history of artist organizing; board members; fundraising efforts specifically their Wages 4 W.A.G.E. campaign; writings on artist compensation; news; and events. A major focus on the website includes the 2010 W.A.G.E survey on artist payment from non-profit arts institutions and guidance on W.A.G.E. certification program and how to get certified. Many of their events and videos focused on publicizing the results of the survey and getting artists and institutions involved in the certification program. Other events include exhibitions and performance art exhibited by W.A.G.E. members, as well as conferences, meetings, and symposia focusing on activism in the arts sector. In 2016, they began publicizing their work on the WAGENCY program.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.) was established in 2008 out of a series of discussions with artists and curators on their experiences with non-payment from art institutions. Out of these meetings, they wrote the wo/manifesto on economic inqualities in the arts sector. In 2010, they launched the W.A.G.E. Survey Report "to gather information about the economic experiences of visual and performing artists exhibiting in non-profit exhibition spaces and museums in New York City between 2005 and 2010." This led to the W.A.G.E. Certification program to recognize arts institutions that commit to paying artists a minimum standard payment. W.A.G.E. received non-profit status in 2011 and partnered with Artists Space to hold programming and investigate their artist compensation practice. In 2016, W.A.G.E. began its collaboration with Decolonize This Place, "an action-oriented space working around Indigenous struggle, Black liberation, Free Palestine, global wage workers and de-gentrification." In 2018, WAGENCY was launched, which certifies artists when they successfully negotiate fees and/or withhold art when organizations do not pay standard renumeration. In 2019, they released a report on the first 5 years of W.A.G.E. certification, W◼A◼G◼E◼ D◼A◼T◼A◼. As of 2022, 108 institutions are certified.</field>
