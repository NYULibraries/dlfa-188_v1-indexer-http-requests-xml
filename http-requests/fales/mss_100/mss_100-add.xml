    <field name="bioghist_teim">The East Village's Mendez Mural Community Garden(11th Street between Avenues A and B), which had been a vacant lot since the early 1970's, was brought into existence in the early 1990's partly through the work of sculptor, Ken Hiratsuka, and muralist, 'Chico' who brought trees, plants and art to the space. The park grew outside of city support in a neighborhood that had suffered in previous years from drug-crime and violence. It became a fixture in the community and was widely utilized. In 1997, the city exercised their claim of ownership on the land, and when then Mayor Guiliani decided to sell the land to real-estate developers, a community uproar and protest followed. In the end, the bid to save the garden was unsuccessful, and on New Years Eve, 1997 the land was bulldozed for condominiums.</field>
