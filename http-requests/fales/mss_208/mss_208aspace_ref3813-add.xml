    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Record Group IV, Series B, pertains to Mary L'Hommedieu Horsford's personal and public life in the form of two series arranged by genre. Series 1: Correspondence includes communication in the form of invitations and letters. Series 2: Manuscripts and Printed Materials consists of private and professional documentation in the form of diary entries, collected and original poetry by Mary and others, records of Mary's writing process in the form of manuscripts, printing proofs, and typescripts of her work Indian Legends and Other Poems. Series 2 also includes ephemera and printed materials in the form of a personal bible full of marginalia; Jared Bell Waterbury's Advice to a Young Christian on the Importance of Aiming at an Elevated Standard of Piety (1830) was once a part of this series, but it has been removed to the Fales Special Collections and cataloged. Please search Bobcat to locate this work.</field>
