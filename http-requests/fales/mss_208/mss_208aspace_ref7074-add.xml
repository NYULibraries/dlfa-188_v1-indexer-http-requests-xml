    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Record Group III, Series B pertains to Mary Catherine L'Hommedieu Gardiner's personal life in the form of correspondence, financial records, and juvenilia. Genres range from letters and gifts, meeting minutes and receipts, original and collected poetry, to penmanship practice materials, and testimonies of religious faith. This subseries is dominated by items that capture Gardiner's conversations with family members, friends, and school acquaintances in reference to courtship, education, family, faith, marriage, and travel. These exchanges also include those between Mary and Samuel during the events leading up to their marriage. Mary's childhood penmanship practice materials also speak to the writing traditions of the time period. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These materials are lightly arranged alphabetically by surname of the individual in contact with Gardiner or the conversation subject. In the case that a record includes more than one date expression, the listing will begin with its earliest. If an item is physically undated, approximate ranges are provided. These records are noted "undated" and followed by a "circa" estimate determined by the range represented in the same series.</field>
