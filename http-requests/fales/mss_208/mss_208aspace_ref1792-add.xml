    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Gardiners of Shelter Island were descendents of Lion Gardiner, an early English settler and soldier in the New World. In 1639, Lion Gardiner purchased property from the Montaukett Native Americans after his support of the tribe during the Pequot War. With a grant from Charles I, Gardiner procured what became the first colonial English settlement in present-day New York state. What would become Gardiners Island in East Hampton, Suffolk County, was originally in its own jurisdiction affiliated with neither New York nor New England. In 1648, a royal British charter recognized the island as a wholly contained colony, independent of both New York and Connecticut. It was not until the American Revolution was the property declared under New York and East Hampton authority. Gardiners Island has been privately owned for over three hundred years by Lion Gardiner's descendants, and is the only real estate still intact as part of an original royal grant from the English Crown. This record group features the life and work of Samuel Smith Gardiner and his wife Mary Catherine L'Hommedieu Gardiner.</field>
