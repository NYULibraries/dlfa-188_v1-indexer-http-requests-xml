    <field name="bioghist_teim">American chemist Eben Norton Horsford (July 27, 1818 - January 1, 1893), was the only son of missionary and politician Jerediah Horsford and his wife Maria Charity Horsford of Moscow, NY. In addition to Eben, Jerediah and Maria Charity produced four daughters: Maria Horsford Byam, Julia Horsford Norton, Eliza Horsford Tryon, and Laura Horsford. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Eben earned a civil engineering degree from RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) in 1838 and contributed to the Geographical Survey of New York under the supervision of geologist and RPI paleontologist James Hall. Between 1840 - 1844, Eben lectured at Delaware's Newark College, in addition to teaching mathematics and natural sciences at the Albany Female Academy, where he would meet sisters Mary L'Hommedieu Gardiner and Phoebe Dayton Gardiner as students. Between 1844 - 1847, Eben studied with chemist Justus Freiherr von Liebig in Giessen, Germany and returned to the U.S. to marry Mary L'Hommedieu Gardiner and serve as the Rumford Professor and Lecturer on the Application of Science to the Useful Arts at Harvard University, where he would steadily publish and teach until 1863. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mary gave birth to four daughters: Mary Leila (Lilian) in 1848, Mary Katherine (Kate) in 1850, Gertrude Hubbard in 1852, and Mary Gardiner (Mamie) in 1855. Mary died a few months after the birth of Mamie. Eben wed Mary's sister Phoebe in 1857, and the couple produced one daughter, Cornelia Conway Felton, in 1860. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1858, Eben founded Rumford Chemical Works with George Francis Wilson, who successfully managed his chemical developments and inventions. Eben's most successful development was the modern formula for baking powder, but he also produced acid phosphate, anti-chlorine, yeast powder, and developed a process for condensing milk. During the American Civil War, Eben devised an "improved army ration" of dehydrated meat; in addition, Rumford generated methods of attaching armor plating to warships, manufacturing fire-proof safes, and water analyses for municipalities in the Boston area. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1873, Eben was selected as a member of the U.S. Scientific Commission for the Vienna Exposition. Eben also strongly supported education and professional options for women while becoming Wellesley College's Board of Visitors President in 1877 and honorary class member in 1886. It was also during this time that Eben began researching and publishing work about Viking settlements in America, namely the "lost city of Norumbega," which is believed to be present Weston, MA, in which he had a monument erected in 1889. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Horsfords led an active social life centered on their Cambridge and Harvard communities. They acquainted with several members of the "Boston Brahmin," in addition to prominent figures of the Cambridge intelligentsia and literary community, including Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Henry Longfellow, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Helen Hunt Jackson to name a few.</field>
