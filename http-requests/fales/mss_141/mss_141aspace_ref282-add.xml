    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is composed of numerous distinct groups of files apparently organized and accumulated at different times over three or four decades. The contents of each group are similar as records relating to personal and family finances are mixed in with materials relating to various works and productions. Among the personal materials are significant amounts of receipts, expenditure records, checking account and other bank statements, records relating to home maintenance, automobiles, mortgages, and income taxes. There is a significant body of records relating to the separate trusts Kopit established for each of his children and the investment records and taxes on them over the last two decades.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among the work-related records are significant amounts of correspondence and contracts recording the legal details and royalty payments of foreign and regional productions of his stage plays and publications of them in numerous countries. There are records relating Kopit's work in the television and film industry as well as some records relating the development of specific works. In particular, in this series is the only significant material relating to a small one-act play entitled "Elegy for the House that Ruth Built" that Kopit wrote to include in "Hitting for the Cycle" a production of numerous short plays about baseball, ca. 1996.</field>
