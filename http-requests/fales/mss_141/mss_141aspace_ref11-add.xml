    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains material and records of plays, screenplays, teleplays and other works that Kopit wrote. There is material from one work he directed. Among all the named projects in the series, many were unproduced. These include the works The Shroud, The Frogs, Cheeky Peeky, Deception, Scientific Process, Norman in Wonderland, Treasure Island, Between the Wars, Deep Purple, Discovery of America, Dream House, MK-Ultra, and Starstruck. Other projects Kopit worked on eventually reached the stage or screen without his final involvement or credit. These include Dr. Zhivago, Sweet Smell of Success, Till Death Us Do Part, In a Child's Name, and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Yet among these records is material on some of Kopit's greatest popular and critical successes such as Wings, Indians, Nine, Phantom and End of the World as well as other endeavors such as the TV movies Roswell, Hands of a Stranger and his adaptation of the Henrik Ibsen play Ghosts. The quality and particular nature of documentation for each project varies. Some works contain greater record of the actual inception of the play through notebooks and index cards and research. Other projects contain a greater amount of material documenting the staging and production. The more successful projects such as Phantom, End of the World and Road to Nirvana contain considerable information on regional, touring and international productions.</field>
