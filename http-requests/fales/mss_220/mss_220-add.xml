    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Robert Blanchon Papers and Collection contains a selection of Blanchon's original works of art, art production-related materials, personal and professional correspondence, teaching materials, a collection of objects of artistic or personal significance, and materials created posthumously for the planning of a Robert Blanchon memorial. The collection also inlcudes documents created by the Robert Blanchon Estate Project from Visual AIDS, which describe the work (conducted from 2003 to 2006) to publish an illustrated catalog documenting Blanchon's complete oeuvre, and to organize several exhibitions of his work. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection of original artwork by Robert Blanchon includes photographic, performance and sculptural work, and collaborative artworks and film work. Art production-related materials include source material for his artworks, artist books, publicity materials and exhibition catalogs. Film, contact sheets, artist test proofs, source photography, slides of artwork, and film works in multiple formats are also part of the collection. Artworks and art production materials date between 1989 and 1999. Robert Blanchon's teaching materials are drawn from his work as adjunct faculty at the University of California, Irvine and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1996 to 1998, and as a visiting artist/scholar at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1998 to 1999. Teaching materials include course readers, course descriptions, syllabi, and student papers and correspondence (access to student records is restricted). Objects of artistic significance include items used in Blanchon's art production, such as a Polaroid camera, bandanas, and clothing labels. Objects of personal significance include items related to Blanchon's personal life, such as his eyeglasses and his Filofax diary. Memorial-related planning materials include letters of condolence, a mailing list, slides of family and friends, and copies of Robert Blanchon obituaries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials generated by Visual AIDS staff members reflect their effort to document and archive every artwork created by Blanchon, to formulate a complete biography of Blanchon's life and artistic career, and to produce an exhaustive bibliography of the literature written about Blanchon. These materials include email correspondence from project coordinators to collectors, Blanchon's friends and colleagues, galleries, and the representative of Robert Blanchon's estate, Mary Ellen Carroll. Other materials include catalogs from Blanchon's exhibitions, copies of articles written about Blanchon and his artwork, contact information for collectors and gallerists, slides of Blanchon's work, grant proposals to fund the project, and the final catalog published in 2006, titled Robert Blanchon. The Visual AIDS materials also include correspondence, notes, plans for artworks, and publications created by Blanchon.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Robert Blanchon Papers June 2018 Accretion contains two series of encyclopedias, on that defines contemporary photography, and a small paperback book of the science of sound. The dates of publication range from 1901 to 1975. 
The collection is arranged into Nine Series:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: Art Production contains original artworks, source material for artworks, sketchbooks, artist books, publicity materials and exhibition catalogs.
Subseries A: Artwork contains photographic, performance and sculptural artworks.
Subseries B: Collaborative Artwork contains artworks created by Blanchon in collaboration with other artists.
Subseries C: Source Materials contains materials that are either not artworks or works made by people other than Blanchon.
Subseries D: Publicity, Notes, etc. contains publicity materials (such as catalogs and postcards) for both Blanchon's work and the work of others, magazines and journals, and Blanchon's notes and source materials for projects.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Correspondence and Notes contains letters related to Blanchon's teaching, art production and exhibitions, and personal life. The collection includes both letters received by Blancon, and copies he made of letters he sent to others. Notes appear in this series when they were already interfiled with correspondence.
 
Series III: Teaching contains course readers, course descriptions, syllabi, and student papers and correspondence [both restricted].

Series IV: Photography contains source photography for artworks, negative film, glass slides, contact sheets, artist test proofs, slides of artwork, and framed photographs of friends and family. Slides of artwork exist both in 8.5 x 11" photo sleeves, and in three archival slide box systems assumed to have been arranged by Blanchon. The slides in the slide boxes generally duplicate the slides that have been arranged into sleeves; access to the slide boxes is by approval only, and researchers should use the sleeved slides for viewing. One group of photographs has been processed within Series VII: Objects - see Object ID: 220.2.0055 "Box of family photographs".
 
Series V: Media contains Robert Blanchon's film works in multiple formats including VHS, Digital Betacam, and DVD. Series also contains cassette tapes, compact discs, and records.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IX: Visual AIDS contains material generated by Visual AIDS during their production of the Robert Blanchon Catalog. It includes email correspondence, catalogs from Blanchon's exhibitions, copies of articles written about Blanchon and his artwork, contact information for collectors and gallerists, slides of Blanchon's work, grant proposals to fund the project, and the final catalog published in 2006, titled Robert Blanchon. The Visual AIDS materials also include correspondence, notes, plans for artworks, and publications created by Blanchon.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Robert Blanchon was born in Foxboro, Massachusetts in 1965. Between 1984 and 1990, he attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he earned his BFA and MFA. While in Chicago, Blanchon was an active participant in the non-profit art scene. He curated exhibitions at N.A.M.E. gallery, contributed to Tony Tasset, et al's artist project "Anonymous Museum", and designed a poster for the City of Chicago's billboard campaign, Art Against AIDS: On the Road.

From 1989 to 1994, Robert Blanchon lived in New York City and worked in the Communications Department at the New Museum of Contemporary Art while producing his photographic, sculptural, performance, and video artworks. He had a studio on Canal Street where he completed many of his early photographic series including the stains, tattoos, and greeting cards series. Also during this period, Blanchon created two of his most widely known and exhibited artworks, "Untitled (self-portrait)" (1991), a series of fourteen self-portraits commissioned by street artists, and "Protection" (1992), a letter by the artist to his mother telling her he was HIV positive, juxtaposed with her twelve-page response. He had two solo shows in New York City, at Artists Space in 1994 and at White Columns in 1995.

In 1995, Blanchon moved to California to take a position as an artist-in-residence at the University of California, Irvine. Teaching and art-making were from this point forward his main occupations. While in California, he produced the video "let's just kiss and say goodbye" (1995), which was exhibited in national and international film festivals, and he had two major solo shows, one at the Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies in 1996 and one at Marc Foxx Gallery in the following year. He worked at UC Irvine until 1997, leaving after being denied a tenure track position despite his popularity with students who voted him Best Teacher in 1996.

In the spring of 1998, Blanchon moved back to Chicago to become an artist-in-residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and in the fall of the same year, he took another artist-in-residence position at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During this time he had a solo show of new works of photography and sculpture at the June and John Alcott Gallery in Chapel Hill. The following spring he returned to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago to teach a graduate level seminar. By the end of the summer Blanchon was hospitalized due to complications related to AIDS, and on October 3, 1999, he died at age 33.
