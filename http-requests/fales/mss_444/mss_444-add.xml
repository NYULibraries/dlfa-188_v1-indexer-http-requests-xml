    <field name="abstract_teim">Felice Picano (1944-) is an American author, editor, playwright, and activist, was a key figure of the Greenwich Village literary community from the mid-1970s through the 1990s, particularly through his involvement with the literary salon the Violet Quill. In 1977, Picano founded Sea Horse Press, the country's first expressly gay-oriented publishing house; in 1981, Picano became editor-in-chief of The Gay Presses of New York; and in 1982 became Books Editor of the New York Native. The Felice Picano Collection on Sea Horse Press and the Gay Presses of New York consists of materials created or collected by Picano in the course of his editorial engagement concerning gay literature and publishing in New York City in the late 20th century. Materials in this collection include correspondence, memoranda, press releases, financial records photographs, published books, and other ephemera documenting the activities and operations of the Gay Presses of New York (GPNY) and its affiliated publishers: Sea Horse Press, Calamus Books, and the JH Press. The collection also includes art layout boards, photographs taken by Mark Ivin and Jacob Burckhardt, text and reproductions used for the exhibit "Early Gay Presses of New York, 1977-1995," and copies of works published by GPNY. The collection documents not only Picano's role as editor-in-chief, but also his larger role in the publishing of literature by or about gay men in the late 20th century.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Felice Picano (1944-) is an American author, editor, playwright, and activist, was a key figure of the Greenwich Village literary community from the mid-1970s through the 1990s. Author of the novels Smart as the Devil (1975), The Mesmerist (1977), and The Lure (1979), Picano became a principal member of the short-lived and influential literary salon the Violet Quill. In 1977, Picano founded Sea Horse Press, the country's first expressly gay-oriented publishing house, producing works by Dennis Cooper, Doric Wilson, Martin Duberman and Robert Gluck, among others. In 1981, Picano became editor-in-chief of The Gay Presses of New York, and, in 1982, Books Editor of the New York Native. His 1985 memoir, Ambidextrous: The Secret Lives of Children, was banned in England for its rumored depiction of childhood sexuality. Picano is the recipient of several prizes, including the Ferro-Grumley Award, the Gay Times of England Award for best gay novel, and the Syndicated Fiction/PEN Award for best short story. He received the Lambda Literary Foundation's Pioneer Award in 2010, and the City of West Hollywood's Rainbow Award and Citation in 2013.</field>
