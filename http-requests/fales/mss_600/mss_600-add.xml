    <field name="abstract_teim">Douglas Crimp (1944-2019) was an art historian, critic, curator, teacher, photographer, and AIDS activist. Crimp taught contemporary art, art theory, dance theory, feminist theory, gay theory, and queer theory at many institutions. Crimp's work as a critic focused on postmodern art theory, and combined activism, editing, writing, and exhibition curation. His AIDS activism involved personal participation in the group ACT UP, centering AIDS in scholarly journals, and original cultural analysis that contributed to the development of queer theory. He published multiple works, including AIDS Demo Graphics, On the Museum's Ruin, and Before Pictures. The Douglas Crimp Papers (dated 1970-2019) consist of materials created and collected by Crimp documenting his life, AIDS activism, and career as an art critic, curator, and teacher in the fields of dance, film, photography, feminist theory, and queer theory. The bulk of the collection includes correspondence, scholarly articles, drafts of lectures on critical theory topics, manuscripts and drafts for published books, and notes and drafts for seminars and lectures.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Douglas Crimp Papers (dated 1911-2019) consist of materials created and collected by Crimp documenting his life, AIDS activism, and career as an art critic, curator, and teacher in the fields of dance, film, photography, feminist theory, and queer theory. His advocacy of revolutionary advances in performance art, video, photography, painting, and sculpture is apparent in his early writing and curatorial work on such artists as Agnes Martin, Joan Jonas, Cindy Sherman, and Richard Serra, all of whom were seen as artists who were experimenting with traditional methods. Additionally, he challenged the traditional idea of a museum, which he did not see as open to experimentation; this view is evident in his collaboration with Louise Lawler for On the Museum's Ruins. When the AIDS crisis emerged in the mid-1980s, Crimp fought for the rights and visibility of people living with H.I.V.; his activism is not only reflected in his participation in different advocacy groups such as ACT UP but in his writing as well. He focused on queer theory in the 1987 special issue of October titled "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism" (included in this collection in the publication, AIDS Riot: Artist Collectives Against AIDS, New York, 1987-1994) and "Getting the Warhol We Deserve: Cultural Studies and Queer Culture" (1999), about Andy Warhol, among other articles and books.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the collection documents Crimp's career as an art critic, curator, and teacher, and includes correspondence, scholarly articles, drafts of lectures on critical theory topics, gallery invitations and announcements, and notes and drafts for seminars and lectures. Crimp's work as an editor, critic, and writer are particularly well represented through correspondence with publishers, contracts and other agreements, manuscript drafts (in both paper and digital formats), research materials, press releases, and reviews.  Crimp's curatorial work is documented through loan agreements and documents used to plan exhibitions at various galleries. This collection also includes personal materials, such as weekly calendar planners from the late 1970s through the 2000s, personal correspondence, ACT UP t-shirts, and photographs (some of which are in digital formats).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Douglas Crimp (1944-2019) was an art historian, critic, curator, teacher, photographer, and AIDS activist. Crimp was born in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and studied art history at Tulane University in New Orleans. He moved to New York City in 1967, after which he worked as a curatorial assistant at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and as an art critic for Art News and Art International. Crimp taught contemporary art, art theory, dance theory, feminist theory, gay theory, and queer theory at many institutions, including The School of Visual Arts, Sarah Lawrence College, and the University of Rochester.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Crimp's work as a critic focused on postmodern art theory, and combined activism, editing, writing, and exhibition curation. His AIDS activism involved personal participation in the group ACT UP, centering AIDS in scholarly journals, and original cultural analysis that contributed to the development of queer theory. He published multiple works, including AIDS Demo Graphics, On the Museum's Ruin, and Before Pictures, his memoir. Crimp also curated many exhibitions and wrote the corresponding catalogues, most notably, Pictures at Artists Space (1977), which helped launch the careers of artists including Sherrie Levine and Robert Longo, among others. Crimp coined the term "Pictures Generation" to define the work of artists like Longo and Levine, who appropriated images from mass culture to carry out a subversive critique. While editor of the contemporary arts journal October, he wrote articles that upended the idea of the museum as an objective space for presenting artwork. His work influenced a generation of artists, such as Cindy Sherman and Joan Jonas, by exploring the idea that a work of art is dependent on its historical and social circumstances and encouraging artists to be disruptive and revolutionary. </field>
