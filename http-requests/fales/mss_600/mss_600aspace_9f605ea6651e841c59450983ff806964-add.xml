    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series reflects Crimp's work as an art consultant and curator, which focused on promoting artists who were making strides in performance art, dance, and film, such as Agnes Martin, Robert Longo, and Andy Warhol. This focus can be seen in the exhibitions Agnes Martin, Pictures, and Dia's Andy: Through the Lens of Patronage respectively. Materials consist of correspondence, memos, exhibition catalogues and annoucements, press releases, lists of artists' work, photographs of artwork, loan forms, wall text, and contracts with institutions sponsoring the exhibitions. Two exhibitions that Crimp did not curate are included here, The Pictures Generation and Pictures: Before and After, because they were inspired by Crimp's exhibition, Pictures, and reflect his influence on the art world. Additionally, some of his personal artwork was used in the exhibitions and the latter exhibition was dedicated to him. He most likely also acted as a consultant for both exhibitions. A few materials are in Spanish.</field>
