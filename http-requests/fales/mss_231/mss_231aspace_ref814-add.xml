    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. News Notes: The New York Times provides continual coverage of the Republicans avoiding gay issues.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. The GCN team, including Lou Maletta are in Houston for the Republican National Convention. Maletta and the team cover the Republicans support of abstinence-only education and criminal prosecution for 'anyone who knowingly[â€¦]transmit[s] the AIDS virus.' Republican party statements on AIDS prevention are displayed on-screen, including 'We reject the notion that the distribution of clean needles and condoms are the solution to stopping the spread of AIDS.', and stresses 'marital fidelity, abstinence, and a drug-free lifestyle.' The statement also lauds the Boy Scouts of America for 'defending decency' and calls for the disbanding of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The final statement: "Unlike the Democratic party and its candidate, we support the continued exclusion of homosexuals from the military as a matter of good order and discipline."</field>

Another ACT UP protester shows his bruised and bloodied arm and back. Another protester talks about being beaten and trampled by horses.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">5. Robert Dornan is interviewed about gays in the military, specifically Margarethe Cammermeyer. He states that Cammermeyer's family "would rather have had a mom who wasn't a lesbian."  When asked if he's talked to Cammermeyer's children, Dornan states "I've seen them interviewed. It tore that family apart as it always does." Dornan states that gay men in the military would do nothing but have sex with each other and destroy morale. Dornan states that monogamous gay relationships don't exist. Elanor Van Middlesworth, a delegate, is interviewed and states that gays and lesbians should not have equal rights and should instead 'control themselves'. "I don't like to say gay, I like to say homosexual." Van Middlesworth also makes bizarre statements about the Cracker Barrel controversy that gays should not 'handle food' because customers might get AIDS. Michael Undseth, a delegate, is asked what he would do if his son came out to him: "He wouldn't. Because he's not." Undseth states that people choose to be gay and that all people are born heterosexual, and that gays 'recruit'. He recommends counseling and psychotherapy to 'cure' gays. A group of young Republicans happily chant "Burn the log cabin!" A young Republican states "We do not include special rights." Frank Ricchiazzi, a log cabin delegate is interviewed. </field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">6. Lee Sharmat relates that security was constantly trailing GCN and made one arrest. Mary Fisher gives a speech about compassion and tolerance in relation to AIDS. Lou Maletta narrates that after Fisher's speech, Steve Bradley, a GCN reporter and Fisher's friend, was questioned for the fourth time by security because of a t-shirt he wore stating 'No-one Knows I'm HIV-Positive'. Footage is then shown of security harassing Lou Maletta and Bradley. Maletta is led away by security, and a GCN employee is handcuffed and led away. Maletta states Beth Levo, the employee led away in handcuffs, was charged with assaulting a police officer and detained for nine hours. Maletta then states the ACLU is taking on the case.</field>
