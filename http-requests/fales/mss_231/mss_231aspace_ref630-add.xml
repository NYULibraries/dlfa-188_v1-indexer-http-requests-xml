    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. Andy Humm talks about how most of the previous night's show was not broadcast because the tape was jammed, which means most of this episode is actually a repeat of the last one.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. Top story on how someone spray-painted 'O'CONNOR SPREADS DEATH' on Cardinal O'Connor's Madison Avenue residence.  Three people nearby were arrested, 'roughed up', and verbally abused by police. David Meirian's footage from segment 6 of 0285 is repeated. Humm interviews Lori Cohen, an attorney (also part of ACT UP) on the rash of police brutality. Scott Sensenig is mentioned, with a cutaway to his photo in the Village Voice where he has 'two black eyes and a five-inch gash across his forehead'. Graffiti artist Michael Griffith is mentioned. The two discuss the North Precinct incident; Cohen states that the deputy commissioner got paint on his new shoes, and in retaliation sent his police to attack the crowd. One of the only arrests was someone who was videotaping the event. Chris Henley, who suffered a debilitating concussion during the scuffle, is planning to sue the police. Cohen discusses how there has been no response from any level of government or police on the issue. Humm mentions a March 3rd demonstration in Times Square. There is talk about how Manhattan North has always had a bad reputation with gays and lesbians. Humm is then joined by Matt Foreman from the Anti-Violence Project. Foreman talks about how three escort services have recently robbed people. Foreman advises people use word of mouth, and only go with services that use credit cards instead of cash-only. Foreman then discusses that there is an anti-activist feeling among police and an increased militarism because of the recent Gulf War. Cohen talks about how most of the charges against the demonstrators will most likely be dropped because there's little evidence. Foreman talks about being 'weary' of going to demonstrations because he believes he will at some point be targeted by police.</field>
