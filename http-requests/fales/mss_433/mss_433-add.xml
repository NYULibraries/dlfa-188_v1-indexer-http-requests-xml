    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This small collection is made up mostly of correspondence from Montanna to his friend William Mathers, who was living in Dallas at the time these letters were written. Much of the material is undated, but most of it seems to have been written in 1989. Along with the letters, he often sent collages made up of newspaper and magazine clippings, some of which are pasted onto "pediatrics therapy record" stationary, as well as found objects. Over the course of the correspondence, he refers to Mathers with a series of nicknames derived affectionately from "worm," including "Wormus," "Verm," and "Wormicus." Houston also sent Mathers sheet music he had written, as well as addiction narratives from his twelve-step program, and an invitation to attend a family therapy day at West Oak Hospital. There are two letters from Houston to Mathers' one time partner, Terry, and one letter from David Wojnarowicz, written right after his controversial essay for a November 1990 Artists' Space show, "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing," made headlines across the country. There is also one photo collage sent from Mathers, to Houston, in which Houston is pictured.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born Monte Hewson (circa 1952-1990), Montanna Houston (which he also stylized as Montana, Montini, and Montanna Hewston) was an artist, musician, writer, and contemporary of David Wojnarowicz, Richard Kern and Tommy Turner. Houston was raised by an adoptive family, whom he referred to as his step-family, and spent his childhood in Texas. After moving to New York in his mid-twenties, he met and became friends with Kern and Turner around 1979, and later met Wojnarowicz through the two filmmakers. Houston acted in Kern's Stray Dogs (1985) as well as Where Evil Dwells (1985), an unfinished Turner and Wojnarowicz film, in which he was cast as Satan (Joe Coleman is also credited as this character). He also contributed to many of Turner and Kern's zines. For most of his adult life, Houston lived with mental health issues and severe substance use. He left New York in 1986 to return to Houston, Texas, where his adoptive family still lived, and checked himself into West Oak Hospital for treatment. The twelve-step program he took part in there was an important part to his recovery from addiction. Houston died by suicide in 1990.</field>
