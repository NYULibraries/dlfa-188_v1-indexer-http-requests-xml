    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Artists Space (originally called the Committee on Visual Arts, Inc.) was founded in 1972 by arts administrator Trudie Grace and critic Irving Sandler as a pilot project for the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA). The original goal of the Committee was to support young, emerging artists, specifically those who had not yet had a solo show in New York City.  Throughout the years, Artists Space, as a non-profit arts organization, has retained its commitment to exhibiting new and experimental artworks, and has expanded its scope to include readings, panel discussions, film programs, and special series, including the International Projects Program, Selections from the Artists File, and others. The website contains information and descriptions of current and past performances and exhibitions dating back to 1973; a list of all artists that have performed and/or exhibited at the organization; texts and images about events and exhibits; membership information; a calendar of events; and other general information about the venue. The Segue Reading Series is a collaboration between Artists Space and the Segue Foundation, an experimental reading series that has run continuously or 42 years. In April 2020, the reading series shifted to a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</field>
