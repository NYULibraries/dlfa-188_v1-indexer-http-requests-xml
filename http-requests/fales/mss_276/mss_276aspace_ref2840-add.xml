    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Erik Barnouw Looks at Television and the Elections: Is U.S. Democracy Going Down the Tubes?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Erik Barnouw traces the development of the election campaign through the early days of radio to today's big money TV campaigns. Addressing the roles of media companies, sponsors, government, and the candidates, this video presents an incisive overview of 20th century media and democracy. Barnouw deconstructs the outrageous election system in which the only viable candidates are those who can bring a big bundle of money to the campaign to buy air time on TV. In this system, presidential candidates test their political viability with ad agencies and pollsters rather through ideas and new programs; this is not the case in other countries where candidates are often given free time to speak through the media. To Barnouw, not only is our system undemocratic, but it is ultimately a legalized form of bribery in which the candidates are forced to spend millions of dollars buying media time; 30 minute speeches have been diminished to 30-second advertisements in which emotions take over in mini-dramas that shape our political agenda. Included is a discussion of the powerful influence of Political Action Committees or PACs that wield power through donations therefore heavily weighing in with the interests of business. </field>
