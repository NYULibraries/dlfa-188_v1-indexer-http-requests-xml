    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sany Boyer and Gina Tlamsa explain why we didn't know what was happening in Northern Ireland by examining the media censorship that took place in the United Kingdom and the United States during the Northern Irish conflict of the 1980s.  Boyer examines the British government's hand in censoring and misrepresenting the conflict in the mainstream media. Journalists covering the conflict were in London reading press releases instead of doing their own investigation as TV Cameras and journalist were barred from Ireland were also pressured by the British government which kept journalist in the United States from reporting on the issues.Tlamsa takes over for the second half of the show to share her personal experience of when her program at WKCR was pushed off the air after covering the Irish conflict. The show ends with a battle cry demanding "to hear all stories in the media whether or not it is complimentary of the government!" Includes traditional Irish music performed by Tlamsa herself and the Ballad of Joe Doherty, a song about the Irish political prisoner held in the United States under the influence of British government. written by Eric Levine and Chris Henry.</field>
