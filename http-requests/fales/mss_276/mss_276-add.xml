    <field name="bioghist_teim">Paper Tiger Television is a New York-based, non-profit, volunteer video collective founded in 1981. The collective has produced weekly public access television programming that critiques media, culture, and politics. Since its creation, Paper Tiger TV has produced more than 320 videos that aim to expose and fight against the corporate control of mainstream media.  These programs have been shown nationally on public access television stations, and internationally in screenings and installations.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1985, Paper Tiger Television established Deep Dish TV Satellite Network, the first national public access satellite network. Deep Dish TV has since become independent of Paper Tiger TV; however, the two organizations collaborated extensively in 1991 to produce the Gulf Crisis Television Project, a ten-part series exploring many aspects of the Gulf War.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Paper Tiger Television has also been active in social and media activism. Members of the collective have organized several workshops and programs that enable at risk youths and other marginalized groups to have their own voice and become their own advocates. Several of the videos produced through these workshops and programs have gone on to be shown in film festivals and screenings.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The Paper Tiger Television Archive was donated to NYU's Fales Library by the Paper Tiger Television Collective in 2010. Accretions were donated in 2016 by Julie Ludwig, Paper Tiger Television, and in 2018 by Marisa Holmes. Further accretions were donated in 2019.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">http://papertiger.org/, http://blog.papertiger.org/, and http://papertigertv.blogspot.com/ were initially selected by Tamiment curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in circa 2007-2009 as part of the Alternative Mass Media / News Web Sites Web Archive. In November 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2015, these seeds were transferred to the Fales Library. In 2018, http://weinterruptthisprogram.org/  was added. The accession number associated with this website is 2019.057.</field>
