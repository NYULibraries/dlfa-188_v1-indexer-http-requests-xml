    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Paper Tiger Television's website was first collected in 2007, documenting the organization's 25th anniversary. From 2009-2015, the website was captured more consistently, and contains information on their many projects and video series, such as the Paper Tiger Reads Working Women, Surveilling Surveillance, Urban Environmentalism: DIY Living Green, Gentrification in Sunset Park, Military Myths, production on the Peace Pentagon, Public Spaces, Exposing Deception, social movements, Detroit, fast Food workers strike, and El Taller Latino Americano. The website also contained information with descriptions of their historical programs and information on their weekly Wednesday broadcasts. Their blog contained descriptions of their programs,  dating back to 2007 as well as events listings and some behind the scenes information. Video topics included art, community gardens, democracy and dissent, DIY and grassroots media, feminism, education, environment, events, free speech and censorship, science and technology, globalization, health, immigration, labor, LGTBQIA+, media criticism, peace and conflict, politics, pop culture, public space, race and class, science and technology, social movements, urban politics, women, consumerism and capitalism, and youth. In circa 2016-2017, the website redesigned to highlight the Paper Tiger archives (both images and video) and their more recent work dating until 2021. They also were a frequent collaborator with Deep Dish Television, on projects related to Mumia Abu-Jamal and organizing against "white nationalism, neoliberalism, patriarchy, and colonialism" after the election of President Donald Trump.</field>
