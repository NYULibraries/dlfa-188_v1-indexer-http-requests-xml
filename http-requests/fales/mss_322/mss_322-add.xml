    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Pam Butler Good Girl Archive is comprised of original artwork, photographs, audio and video recordings, exhibition proposals, and ephemera primarily related to the "Good Girl" and "Win" street art projects produced by Butler in the 1990s. Elements include poster mock-ups and reproductions, project proposals, flyers, posters and postcards. This body of components also includes interviews conducted with Butler, press coverage, and contextual information related to the New York street art milieu of the 1980s and 1990s. There is also professional and personal correspondence, production and personal photography, digital anthologies, and two self-published collections of work.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Pam Butler is an American fine artist whose work generally explores ideas of social construction and female identity. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born in 1956, Butler grew up in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York, and moved to New York City in 1978. In 1992, while working as a bookkeeper, she began pasting homemade posters onto buildings, lamposts, and other city fixtures. The black and white images, done in marker, depicted a stylized woman accompanied by a perjorative ("Good Girl," "Whore," "Angel" etc.). By the end of the year the work had become a familiar presence in lower Manhattan; 10,000 posters, consisting of over 230 drawings, were eventually put up over a two-year period ending in 1994. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Butler's next project, titled "Win," incorporated the cumulative and serendipitous qualities of her earlier street art into an interactive public work. Viewers were invited by Butler's posters and flyers to call and write in to an entity called the Win Line, and share their reactions to various questions related to success ("Have you ever won the lottery?", "Suppose your life ws all over and you hadn't gotten the grand prize yet?"). Responses were recorded on an answering machine, and in public using video. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">These projects could be considered in the tradition of other New York street and public artists like Keith Haring, AVANT, and Jenny Holzer. Since the 1990s she has continued to make and exhibit her art. Butler received a MFA from the School of Visual Arts in 1990, and has exhibited at P.S. 122, White Columns, Artists Space, FDR Gallery, and Visual Arts Gallery.  </field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The contents of the Pam Butler/Good Girl Archive were donated by Pam Butler to the Fales Downtown Collection in 2011.</field>
