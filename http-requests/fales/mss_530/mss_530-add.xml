    <field name="abstract_teim">The Judith Braun Papers consist of records of artist Judith Braun's creative feminist work from 1987 to 2014. Artwork, research, correspondence, and articles pertaining to her exhibitions from 1978 to 1997 create the bulk of this collection. After graduating from Empire State College in Albany, New York in 1979 with a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts, Braun pursued realistic figure painting until 1982 when she transitioned to combining her visual artwork with text and innuendo through photocopying. The artwork within this collection reflects Braun's changing artistic output and her creation of the persona Weinperson.  Applications for grants, residencies, and show proposals from 1987 to 2011 are included as a part of this collection as well as a small amount of interviews from 2012 to 2014. The posters available in this collection are remnants of Braun's large scale photocopying process.</field>

The collection documents Braun's large scale photocopying process with initial images, enlarged photocopied grid pieces, photographs and slides of large scale wall hangings, and large scale posters.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Judith Braun (1947 - ), also known as Judith Weinperson and Weinperson, is a New York City-based artist. After graduating from Empire State College in Albany, New York, in 1979 with a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts, she pursued realistic figure painting until 1982 when she transitioned to combining her visual artwork with text and innuendo through photocopying. During this artistic transition Braun was pursuing her Masters in Arts and Masters in Fine Arts at State University of New York at Albany, New York, graduating in 1983. In 1989 she created the persona Weinperson, an alteration of her married name Weinman. The Weinperson persona represented Braun in her experiments with racial and sexual innuendos in her photocopied creations. Braun exhibited as Weinperson or Judith Weinperson from 1988 to 1995 before retreating from her creative practice until 2003.</field>
