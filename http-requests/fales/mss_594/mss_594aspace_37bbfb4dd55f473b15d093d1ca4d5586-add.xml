These files include correspondence with apartment management; photographic documentation of the building management's neglect of the apartment; Doroshow's requests to agencies for rent assistance; and his disbutes with utility companies. This series also contains material related to his legacy as a mentor to the LGBTQ community and drag performers which is evident in his personal correspondence which is full of notes and well-wishes; photographs from 2017 of his last birthday party; documentation of the establishment of the Flawless Sabrina Archives by his friends; and a program from his 2018 memorial service.</field>
