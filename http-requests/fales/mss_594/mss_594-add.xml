    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Jack Doroshow/Flawless Sabrina Papers consist of paper and electronic files created and collected by Jack Doroshow documenting his personal life and career as Flawless Sabrina the drag queen, actor, writer, and producer. This collection provides insight into the work and life of a drag entertainer and business person in New York during the 1960s through 2010s, including his exploration into a variety of business and entertainment ventures, his struggles financially supporting himself as an artist, and his relationships with artists and performers. This collection also documents the evolution of the drag community through the years within New York City.  


Doroshow's various projects within the music, television, theatrical, and film industries include the 1968 documentary film The Queen; an unrealized talkshow, The Apple Pie Show, with John Waters and Divine; and the movie More, More, More. Project files in this collection typically include proposal packets, scripts, budgets, and correspondence. Documentation on Jack's career as Flawless Sabrina and also the drag queen community in general is represented through photographs, event promotional material, set plans,  notes, and cue cards. Large photograph collages once mounted on Doroshow's apartment walls contain images of Doroshow with friends and partners at home and events throughout his life. 


This collection contains a notable amount of issues dating from 1973 to 1984 of Michael's Thing, a guide to information and entertainment for the LGBTQ community within the New York City area. This weekly publication provided articles, interviews, and advertisements which focused on the interests of the community including drag shows, dance clubs, and special events. These issues not only document popular events and places during this time, but Doroshow was also a contributing writer. A large number of loose notes, notepads, and notebooks date from the 1970s to the 2010s, containing Dorowshow's ideas, thoughts, production notes, to do lists, quotes, brief journal entries, and sketches. 


While working on his various entertainment industry projects, Doroshow supported himself through successful and unsuccessful business ventures including selling antiques, children's quilts, and two unrealized magazines, Reflections and Casino. His struggles to financially support himself and maintain his rent-controlled apartment in New York are well-documented in this collection, especially as he grew elderly, relying on his community to assist him. Doroshow's role as a mentor to the LGBTQ community is evident in his correspondence and notes with performers and friends, as well as appearances where he would share his experiences with others. This collection also contains material on his personal life, including resumes, and family photographs, as well as material he accumulated on partners and various people in his life.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jack Doroshow (1939-2017), also known as the drag queen Flawless Sabrina, was a performer, writer, producer, and mentor to LGBTQ community members. In 1959 Doroshow along with two friends staged a drag pageant in Philadelphia, which eventually led to the creation of his persona Flawless Sabrina, who served as pageant hostess. He eventually formed his own company, Nationals Academy, to tap into the drag show subculture through pageants in large and small American cities. His most famous pageant was the 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Contest of which the footage was made into a 1968 documentary The Queen by Frank Simon. Sabrina acted as mistress of ceremonies and film narrator. The success of the documentary resulted in an increase in speaking engagements and television appearances. Doroshow also sold antiques, as well as produced projects in film, television, and theater. He was well-known as Mother Sabrina, a mentor to not only drag performers, but other members of the LGBTQ community. He passed away in 2017.</field>
