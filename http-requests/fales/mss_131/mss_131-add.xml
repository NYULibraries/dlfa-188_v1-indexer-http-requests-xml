    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Michelangelo Signorile Papers follow the development of Signorile's writing career from its early stages through the publishing of his most recent book, Life Outside, and his magazine articles of the late 1990s. From his days at Outweek forward, the collection documents the life cycle of each of his books and columnist jobs, from initial reporting and research to fan letters in response to the published articles. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">An extensive account of Signorile's career in the late 1980s through the end of the 1990s, the archive serves as an informative chronicle of the gay movement towards further recognition and visibility in America. It also offers evidence on how the American media operates today-the ethical debate on outing, of which Signorile was a prominent figure, was a battle fought, in many ways, through the media. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Significant moments of Signorile's writing work highlighted here include the Malcolm Forbes outing at Outweek, the fall of Outweek, the outing of Pete Williams at The Advocate and the issue of gays in the military, the activist fight against homophobia in Hollywood and elsewhere, the publishing of Queer in America, his often-controversial columns written at Out magazine, and the publishing of Outing Yourself in 1995 and Life Outside in 1997. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Over a third of the collection is made up of research materials gathered during Signorile's reporting for articles and books, made up of clippings, interviews, activist literature, etc., which are found in Series II. Some original manuscripts are included in Series III, particularly two complete drafts of Queer in America. Also a thorough collection of publicity-profiles, interviews, reviews, and quotes, as well as many folders of reader letters-records the impact his writing had on Americans, both gay and straight, and the American media itself.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Original format for most materials. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">SERIES DESCRIPTIONS</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II is the broadest series in the collection, made up of various materials compiled as research and content for books and articles.

Profiles, interviews, book award nominations, ads, and various articles in which Signorile is quoted are also found here.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In some cases this series' material will relate closely to related topics in Series II.

The six video tapes feature Signorile interviews, TV coverage, and a documentary on gay activism. The audio tapes include mostly reporter interviews ranging from Outweek to Out. Video and audio materials are organized in the series by approximate date. Computer disks include research articles compiled from electronic research services.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1988, at the age of 27, Michelangelo Signorile was a gossip columnist covering the wild nightclub scene of the 1980s, searching out the scene of the moment-whether it was Area, the Limelight, or the Palladium-in hopes of the hottest celebrity tidbit. Political activism may have been the farthest thing from his mind as he jotted down every juicy detail, but one night-as he describes in his first book, Queer in America-he was enticed into conversation by a pair of attractive, muscled members of ACT UP. Weeks later, he joined a group of activists at St. Peter's Church in midtown Manhattan for a protest of a speech by Cardinal Josef Ratzinger. Although he had joined them somewhat apprehensively, the harsh words of the vocally anti-gay leader soon drove him to wave his fists and shout to the shocked cathedral that Ratzinger was "no man of God." The afternoon ended with the Signorile and five others in handcuffs. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">As Signorile explains, the experience at St. Peter's proved to be a pivotal one. "My nightclub life almost completely stopped… It seemed pointless to go to these plastic affairs and have dull, irrelevant conversations after spending all day on ACT UP… I was feeling powerful about being gay." His new focus on gay activism sent his writing career on a political, and often controversial direction. By the summer of 1989, Signorile had become one of the founding editors of Outweek, a weekly gay magazine, where his all-cap diatribes against the right-wing and the gay closet would soon help fuel a national controversy on the ethics of "outing." In the process, it would also firmly establish his career. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> A New York resident for the majority of his life thus far, Signorile was born to an Italian-American family in 1960, spending his youth in Brooklyn and Staten Island. He was educated at the Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University in Staten Island. His work as a publicist for an entertainment PR firm eventually led to his nightclub-circuit gossip column in Nightlife magazine. At Outweek, Signorile penned a weekly column called GossipWatch, wherein, amidst other topics, he would demand that gay and lesbian celebrities stand up for their community by publicly declaring their homosexuality. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The outing debate hit the national media via Outweek's pages with the posthumous outing of Malcolm Forbes, the renowned publishing tycoon. Signorile felt that the media's praise of Forbes as an American success story was consciously leaving out an important aspect of his life-that he was gay. The Outweek exposé sparked a debate on the ethics of outing and raised the question of whether there was a double standard in the way the media approached individual privacy. After the abrupt closure of Outweek in 1991, Signorile joined The Advocate as a columnist, where he gained further notoriety by outing Pete Williams, lead spokesman for the Pentagon during the Gulf War. He pointed out an apparent hypocrisy in Dick Cheney and the Pentagon's tacitly accepting Williams' homosexuality while they simultaneously led a military that banned all gays and lesbians.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Signorile's politically-charged writing at Outweek and The Advocate eventually drove the creation of his first book, Queer in America, a part-autobiography, part-reporting work published in 1993. In the book, he confronted institutionalized closets in the media, Hollywood, and the United States government-"the Trinity of the closet"-and examined how damaging closets could be for individuals in power and for the American society they affected. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Two years later, the press suggested that Signorile had softened his image after he published his second book, Outing Yourself, which described 14 steps towards coming out of the closet. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s, he worked as a columnist for Out magazine, and later returned to The Advocate as an editor-at-large. At Out, columns on topics such as pro-life gays, animal rights, gay marriage, and bareback sex continued his knack for controversy. In a 1994 column, "Unsafe Like Me," he sparked an important debate on unsafe sex amongst gay men by admitting that he himself had recently had unprotected sex. His third book, Life Outside, published in 1997, continued his analysis of gay behavior in the 90s with an investigation of the gay circuit-party scene, its emphasis on body image and drugs, and the search for life outside of it. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">As of 2003, at 42 years old, Signorile was writing "The Gist" published weekly in New York Press and on www.signorile.com , where he tackled a spectrum of national issues, often returning to the unfinished battles of gay activism. He planned to publish a book on Italian-Americans on Staten Island in 2003.</field>
