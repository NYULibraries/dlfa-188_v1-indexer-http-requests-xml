    <field name="custodhist_teim">New York University's collection of papyri and other early writing artifacts was acquired in two installments. In 1924, about 500 items were identified by English papyrologist H.I. Bell at the excavation site of the ancient Egyptian village of Karanis. The second installment was acquired in 1932 by Professor Casper J. Kraemer, Jr., Chairman of the Department of Classics, historically referred to as the "Cairo Purchase." There is little documentation on the materials that comprise this accretion to the collection. More recently, additional items have been added to the collection through faculty in the NYU Department of Classics, including Professor Bluma L. Trell and Professor Lionel Casson. The materials in this collection were acquired in a historical context of western archaeological extraction of African and Mediterranean cultural heritage.</field>
