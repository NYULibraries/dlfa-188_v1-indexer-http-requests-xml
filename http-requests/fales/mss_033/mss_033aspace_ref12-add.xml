    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I contains the majority of the collection's contents, roughly 12,000 items of original correspondence, in eight boxes or roughly twelve linear feet. The series offers strong representation for the years 1832-1860 and is weaker with regard to the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. Barnard's outbound missives, which represent only a half linear foot of the full series, usually appear as handwritten drafts though the few dating from the 1890s are usually typescript copies. Many of Barnard's letters are addressed to his friends and colleagues, particularly Elisha R. Potter, Daniel Coit Gilman, his elder brother Chauncey Barnard, and to Will Monroe, his assistant in the 1890s and the donor of the collection to New York University. In addition there are a small number of letters addressed to his wife and children as well as copies of more official communications, such as a few missives Barnard wrote as Commissioner of Education to President Andrew Johnson, and solicitations dispatched to various scholars requesting contributions to his periodicals.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The rest of the series is composed of original handwritten incoming letters, which in a few rare cases were replaced with photocopies due to physical deterioration. Most of the letters are routine communications related to Barnard's publications, the Connecticut Common School Journal, Journal of the Rhode Island Institute of Instruction, and the American Journal of Education. These missives often take the form of requests for subscriptions or catalogs, bills, and purchase orders. Included as well are invitations and requests for speeches at ceremonial occasions and professional gatherings. A much smaller portion of the correspondence partially reflect the relationships, both personal and professional, Henry Barnard enjoyed with prominent scholars and educators of the nineteenth century, including letters from Amos Bronson Alcott (4 letters), William Alcott (42 letters), George Washington Atherton (26 letters), Frederick A.P. Barnard (3 folders), Newton Bateman (29 letters), Samuel P. Bates (71 letters), Catherine E. Beecher (1 folder), Nathan Bishop (46 letters), Vincenzo Botta (32 letters), James D. Butler (57), Lyman C. Draper (34), Ralph Waldo Emerson (1 letter), James A. Garfield (3 letters), Daniel Coit Gilman (7 folders), Elias Loomis (9 letters), Horace and Mary Mann (3 folders), Elizabeth Peabody (54 letters), John D. Philbrick (352 letters), Elisha R. Potter (282 letters), Robert H. Quick (80 letters), Per Adam Siljestrom (13 letters), Ashbel Smith (36 letters), William H. Wells (202 letters), Andrew White (10 letters), and Hermann Wimmer (79 letters).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also within Series I are roughly twenty letters that, while not addressed to Barnard, were written by or addressed to other members of the Barnard family and their friends. Examples of these items include a written promise dated 1765 from John Barnard to Ebenezer Crosby, four letters to addressed to a Dr. Eli Todd from the 1820s, and a letter from Henry Barnard's elder brother Chauncey addressed to their father.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">An alphabetical index of the correspondence held in Series 1C of the Henry Barnard Papers, which lists the names of each correspondent and provides identifying numbers for retrieving their letters, is available at Fales Library.</field>
