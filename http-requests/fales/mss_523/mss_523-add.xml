The MRNY Downtown Clubbing Collection consists of publications, ephemera, and other materials collected by Mark Thompson and Robert Doyle documenting their experiences in the New York City downtown nightlife scenes from 1978-2010. The collection includes flyers, members club cards, pins, matchbooks, and magazines, as well as playbills, posters, festival guides, and books related to gay culture in America from 1987 to 2012.

Collection material before 1995 primarily reflects downtown New York City nightlife while material from the 2000s emphasizes music festivals outside of the city.</field>
