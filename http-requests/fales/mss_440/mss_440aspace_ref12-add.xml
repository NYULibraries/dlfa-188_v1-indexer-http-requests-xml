    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes materials used in the creation of Smith's films and performance pieces, including scripts, notes, drawings, photographs, collages, flyers, posters, metal plates and mylar proofs for offset lithography, clippings, and correspondence. Included in the Flaming Creatures material are Smith's journal kept during the filming, a letter written by Smith to the Village Voice regarding the film, flyers for screenings, and notes on Jonas Mekas and his distribution of the film.  The influence of Smith's disagreement with Mekas is evident throughout this series and includes flyers, mylar proofs, and offset lithography plates for I Was a Mekas Collaborator and How Can Uncle Fishhook Have a Free Bicentennial Zombie Underground?; flyers, notes, and scripts for Smith's adaptation of Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Critic, variously titled The Critic, The Lobsters, Lucky Landlordism of Roachcrust, and Lucky Landlordism of Lotusland; and flyers for Death in Uncle Archives' Vault.  Maria Montez is another influence found throughout the series, in particular in Memoirs of Maria Montez, or Wait for Me at the Bottom of the Pool and throughout Smith's notes, untitled writings, and untitled artworks.  Notes, scripts, and flyers regarding Mario Montez performances can also be found throughout the series, including Normal Love, Flaming Creatures, and No President.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other material in this series includes script pages and correspondence regarding Normal Love and Normal Fantasy; posters, programs, and correspondence regarding film series and festivals that included screenings or performances by Smith; and original artwork and collages used by Smith to promote his performances. There are materials from a handful of productions written and directed by other artists in which Smith performed or attended. The bulk of the series consists of loose notes and notebooks, which include lists of titles for works; to-do lists and shopping lists; and ideas for new films or writings.  In addition to these notes are longer pieces of untitled writing, of two paragraphs or more.  Untitled artwork not related to Smith's artwork for his films and performances includes photographs, drawings, and collages, and an untitled mixed media art piece found in an envelope and assumed to be an artwork created by Smith. </field>
