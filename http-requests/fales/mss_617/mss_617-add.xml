    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents the Autonomedia web presence from 2007-2017. From 2007-2011, the homepage of Autonomedia listed recent books published by the organization with short summaries and reviews of the books. Topics of books published by the press include anarchism, radical arts, counterculture, criticism, biographies, drugs, ecology, economics, education, feminism, fiction, history, poetry, Marxism, philosophy, politics, race, religion, and theory. In 2010, the website redesigned. The bookstore subdomain includes listings of bestsellers as well as books featured and on sale by the organization. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection also contains the website for the InterActivist Info Exchange, initially established as a project of Autonomedia and the InterActivist Network. The forum featured news, events, reviews, announcements, and analysis from independent media sources. The forum existed on both subdomains of Interactivist and Autonomedia, http://slash.interactivist.net/ and http://slash.autonomedia.org/, respectively, until 2010. In around 2011, the website redesigned at http://interactivist.autonomedia.org/.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Founded in 1984, Autonomedia is a North American publisher of radical theoretical works, especially in the anarchist tradition. Autonomedia publishes books on topics such as anarchism, Marxist works, cyberfeminism, drug literature, turn of the 21st century queer individualist anarchist novels, and other works. They are known for publishing the "Autonomedia Calendar of Jubilee Saints," in which every day of the calendar recalls a deceased person of some significance to progressive movements or thought. They also maintain the InterActivist Info Exchange, an online forum for discourse and debate on themes relevant to the books that they publish.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">http://www.autonomedia.org/, http://bookstore.autonomedia.org/, http://interactivist.autonomedia.org/, http://slash.interactivist.net/, and http://slash.autonomedia.org/ were initially selected by Tamiment curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in circa 2007-2009 as part of the Alternative Mass Media / News Web Sites Web Archive. In November 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2015, http://www.autonomedia.org/, http://interactivist.autonomedia.org/, and http://bookstore.autonomedia.org/ was transferred to Fales Libary.</field>
