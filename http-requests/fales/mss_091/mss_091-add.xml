    <field name="bioghist_teim"> Founded in 1978 by Stefan Eins, Fashion Moda quickly became an important voice in the art world during the late 70's to mid-80's. Defining itself as a 'concept' and its South Bronx location as 'Museum of Science, Art, Invention, Technology, and Fantasy,' Fashion Moda crossed boundaries and mixed metaphors, which helped to redefine the function of art. Featuring such artists as Keith Haring, David Wojnarowicz, Jenny Holzer, Mark Kostabi, Joe Lewis, John Ahearn, Kenny Scharf and graffiti artists like Richard Hambleton, Koor, Crash, Daze, Spank and many others, Fashion Moda was a major force in establishing new venues. Its South Bronx location allowed Fashion Moda the freedom to explore the question "What is art?" and "Who defines it?" Mostly funded by grants from the NEA, NYSCA and other, outside money, the space encouraged the production of art that was not dictated by the contemporary art market or academic art training. As such, it was a center where many downtown and local South Bronx artists, writers, and performance artists first displayed their works and workshopped their ideas. It was closely tied to the global emergence of Hip Hop. Fashion Moda closed its South Bronx location in 1993. However it continues in concept. Artforum: "Fashion Moda has been around forever." </field>
