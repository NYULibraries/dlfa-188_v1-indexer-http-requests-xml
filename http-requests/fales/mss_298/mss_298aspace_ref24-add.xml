    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries comprises index cards created for each artwork that the gallery attempted to sell but could not and returned to the artist. Each card displays that artwork's inventory number, which can also be found on corresponding records in this series. The cards are color coordinated.Pink card: The work was given to Annina Nosei, that is, she did not buy it. There was no money involved. On many of these cards you will find written the word "gift."Blue card: The work was bought by the Gallery. Most cards denote the amount paid.White card: The work was consigned to the gallery either by the artist, another dealer, another gallery, or a collector.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries is arranged in its original order. The index cards were originally contained in file drawers labeled "RTA" (which stands for "Returned to Artist") followed by an alphabetical range. This naming convention has been replicated here (e.g., the cards under the heading "RTA A-D-F" were originally held together in one file drawer labeled "RTA A-D-F"). The ranges of artists contained in each box has been provided by the archivist in the space below the box number.</field>
