    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Marion Nestle Papers document Marion Nestle's career as an author, public figure, and professor in the nutrition, food studies, and public health fields. The collection primarily consists of materials involved in the creation of her books, including Nestle's notes, research files, correspondence, book tour plans, and book drafts. Printed materials including restaurant menus, and food event flyers, and conference programs comprise another significant component of the collection. Nestle's correspondence with other authors, professors, and individuals from the food studies movement as well as materials from her professional roles as the senior nutritionist at the Surgeon General, as a teacher at New York University, the University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco, and as a lecturer at food-related events, colloquia, and symposia constitute a smaller part of the collection. Nestle's role as an editorial reviewer and advisor appear in the correspondence and printed materials she collected. The bulk of Nestle's research files span the years 1980-2013.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Marion Nestle is a nutritionist, consumer advocate, and academic whose research examines scientific and socioeconomic influences on food choice, obesity, and food safety, emphasizing the role of food marketing.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">After completing a Bachelor's Degree in Bacteriology at the University of California Berkeley in 1959, Nestle went to earn a PhD in Molecular Biology in 1968 and an MPH in Public Health Nutrition in 1986, also from UC Berkeley.  She is Paulette Goddard Professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University, which she chaired from 1988-2003. From 2008 to 2013, she wrote Food Matters, a monthly food column in the San Francisco Chronicle. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Nestle received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Transylvania University in 2012, and a James Beard Leadership Award in 2013, among many other awards.  She has appeared as an expert in numerous films, including Super Size Me, Food Fight, and In Organic We Trust.  In 2011, the University of California School of Public Health at Berkeley declared her a "Public Heath Hero."  In Forbes magazine, food writer Michael Pollan named Nestle the "the world's #2 most powerful foodie," calling her "an indispensable voice on the problems of the American diet and their roots in industry marketing and government policy."  New York Times writer Mark Bittman has described Nestle as "the #1 foodie to be thankful for," calling her an "all-around heroine" and noting that "many of those involved in the food movement [started] with Marion Nestle."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">She has run a blog and web site, foodpolitics.com, since 2006 and a twitter account, @marionnestle, since 2009. </field>
