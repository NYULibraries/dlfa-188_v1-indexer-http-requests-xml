    <field name="abstract_teim">The Washington Square Contemporary Music Society (WSCMS) seeks to further the cause of new music by presenting recent works. The Society was founded in 1976 by composer Brian Fennelly. Louis Karchin, Professor in the Music Department of New York University's Faculty of Arts and Science, joined the directorship in 1980. Both composers had already demonstrated their leadership in contemporary music; prior to joining WSCMS, Mr. Karchin co-founded the Harvard Group for New Music and the Chamber Players of the League/ISCM. Since 1976, established composers whose works have been presented include Shulamit Ran, Morton Feldman, John Adams, Milton Babbitt, John Cage, Elliott Carter, Frank Zappa, Phillip Glass, Joan Tower, John Zorn, George Walker, and Charles Wuorinen, among hundreds more. The collection comprises adminstrative records created by the Society, such as programs, flyers, and grant applications, as well as audio recordings of performances.</field>
