    <field name="bioghist_teim">Joseph Lovett is a documentary film and television producer, writer, and director whose films have focused on raising awareness on health and LGBTQ issues. Lovett started his career as a freelance editor and assistant working on networks, features, and industrials. Around 1974, he started working as an editor and producer at CBS News Magazine. In 1977, he produced his first film for CBS, Parents of Gays. In 1979, Lovett became a producer at ABC's 20/20, where he developed some of the first televised investigations into the AIDS epidemic and the inaction of the U.S. government. Additionally, he produced stories on Mike Tyson, the Duvaliers, and airline safety, among other subjects. In 1989, Lovett founded Lovett Productions, Inc. (later, Lovett Stories + Strategies), where he produced, in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and ABC, In a New Light. In a New Light was a five-year AIDS awareness primetime special televised in the 1990s. In 2001, Lovett won a Peabody Award for writing, producing, and directing HBO's Cancer: Evolution to Revolution. His first feature, Gay Sex in the 70s, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2005, and was broadcast on the Sundance Channel in 2007.
