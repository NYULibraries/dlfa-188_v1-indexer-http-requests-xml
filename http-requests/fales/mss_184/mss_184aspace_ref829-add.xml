    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains photographs and slides of A.I.R. exhibitions or of artworks by individual artists. The structure of the subseries remains faithful to the A.I.R. photo and slide inventory as it arrived at the Fales Library. The numbering system used by A.I.R. has been kept intact and is noted in the finding aid below. Subseries U consists of photographs and slides that were not part of the initial photos/slides series, but were received later as ancillary material. Subseries V consists of the A.I.R. Slide Registry, which was kept onsite at the Gallery as a resource for curators and other artists. The names listed in the finding aid for each binder does not comprise a complete list of the contents of that binder.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some folders in the SLIDE subseries contain no slides, reflecting that slide sleeves were empty when collection was accessioned at Fales.</field>
