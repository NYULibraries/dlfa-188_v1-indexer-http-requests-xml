    <field name="scopecontent_teim">New York City COVID-19 Food Studies Web Collection is made of archived websites that detail the impact on COVID-19 on food communities in New York City. It documents the effects of the pandemic on New York University's campuses and their surrounding food communities, their shifts in cultural, economic, and social practices around the city, and their organizing and response efforts, with an intentional focus on Black and Indigenous People of Color, Asian American Pacific Islander, and LGBTQIA+ communities.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Food communities documented in the collection consist of food workers, farms and their workers, food non-profits, food vendors, farmers' markets, private and community gardens, alternative food sources, mutual aid networks, community refrigerators and food pantries, restaurants, and soup kitchens. The collection focuses on issues of food justice and food scarcity through a lens of race and class. within NYU's staff and students and in the greater New York City community.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In March 2020, non-essential businesses throughout New York City closed in an effort to contain COVID-19, a respiratory virus that first identified in December 2019. The virus and the closures disproportionally affected systematically excluded groups, such as Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, Asian American Pacific Islander, and LGBTQIA+ communities. Restaurants and other public venues were closed to indoor dining and could only offer delivery and take-out; later many closed permanently. Chinatown restaurants were harshly affected, not only due to closures, but due to an increase in anti-Asian racism and xenophobia. Street vendors also suffered, due to lack of commuters and minimal protections. Early in the pandemic, restaurants also provided free meals to essential workers and other food workers changed their business models to remain in business. In late March 2020, Congress passed the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) which, in addition to other government assistance, helped keep restaurants and small businesses open. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Closures also led to unemployment, which increased the need for food aid programs. Both governmental and mutual aid food programs sprung up to assist food insecurity, especially for children who depended on school meals and Black, Lantine, and immigrant communities whose food insecurity was excerabated by the pandemic. The NYU community also provided courtesy meal programs for food insecure students and quarantining and isolating students.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Summer 2020 also led to the expansion of outdoor dining as part of the New York City reopening program. Indoor dining returned in August 2020, which led to debate between the financial needs of businesses and minimizing the spread of COVID-19. In 2022, vaccine requirements led to conflict between diners and restaurants. As of this writing in June 2022, the pandemic is still an active part of life. </field>
