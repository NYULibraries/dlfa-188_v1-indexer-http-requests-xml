    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series primarily consists of photographs, as well as paper material related to Kembra Pfahler and Samoa Moriki's New York City-based glam rock band, The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black (TVHKB). This series contains material dating from the late 1980s to the 2000s when the band was most active and performing in New York City clubs including the Kitchen, Ritz, CBGB, Pyramid, Marquee, and Boy Bar, as well as summer tours in 1994 and 1995. The majority of this series chronicles their performances through photographs by multiple New York-based photographers including Laure Leber, Katrina del Mar, Steve Glemboski, and Tina Paul. These glam rock-style, darkly humorous performances often include large props, graphic nudity, and simulated sexual acts. Many performances included a segment where Pfahler, dressed as her Karen Black character, wearing a wig and false rotted teeth in full body paint performing a handstand while band members dressed as bunnies cracked eggs filled with coloring onto Pfahler's vaginal area. Photographs in this series also document the band's pre-show preparations including painting their naked bodies, attaching wigs and false teeth, and doning costumes, as well as post-show images of the band meeting fans, socializing with each other, and the removal of their body paint in small utility sinks and showers backstage during their tours. Images of photo shoot with the band were produced for use on posters, announcements, and album covers. Most of these photographs were taken by New York photographers including Richard Kern, Annie Sprinkle, Michael Halsband, and Michael Levine.


A small collection of handwritten music lyrics, setlists, stage directions, tour scrapbooks, press clippings, and Pfahler's costume sketches are in this series, along with promotional material including show posters, telephone cards with the band image, and event annoucements. This series also includes graphics, mock-up boards, and release event posters for their albums include Neiborachie - The Guy Next Door and A National Health Care.</field>
