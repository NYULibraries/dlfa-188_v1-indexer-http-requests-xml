    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains material, a majority of which are photographs, related to projects Pfahler pursued outside of the band, as well as personal files and photographs. Pfahler's participation in the 1980s underground film movement Cinema of Transgression, is well documented in this series through handmade fliers, posters, correspondence, and photgraphic stills for Murder Mysteries, Historic Beauty Treatments, Cornella: The Story of a Burning Bush, and Mild Seven: The Cowboy Stories. Film stills for Trilogy of Teri include fellow-artists Nick Zedd and Annie Sprinkle as actors. The series also contains material documenting her film acting through video sleeve covers and promotional material for 1990s fetish films, which depict imagery of BDSM and other simulated sex acts. Film stills and on-set photographs for her acting jobs in Boys on the Side and Ferrum 5000 are also in this series.


Her performance art career is well-represented in this series, including photographic documentation and promotional material dating from 1984 to 1987 for Pfahler's early performance art group, Oroboro, which often included her husband/fellow band member, Samoa. Later performance art pieces dating from the 1990s and 2000s include Pfahler as her Karen Black character, with her naked body painted, wearing a black wig and false rotting teeth. She is photographed in various locations, sometimes also with members of the Karen Black band in costume as well. Some performance art pieces were later produced as videos/films, including her 1996 Punk Ladies of Wrestling (PLOW) event and film. Material for PLOW includes photographs, a press release, and promotional material for the film.


Pfahler's work as a visual artist shown through drawings and photographic self-portraits date from the early 2000s to 2010. Many of the works were exhibited at New York galleries. Her openings often included a performance art piece and/or band performances. Images of installations, opening parties, and performances are in this series, as well as exhibition artwork lists, notes, posters, and announcements. These performances and artworks often include Pfahler in her Karen Black character. Examples include the 2003 exhibition Kembra Pfahler: Availabism and Anti-Naturalism: A Feminine Experiment (which included a live performance of A Star is Born: The Horror Version), Womanizer in 2008, and Giverny with artist E.V. Day in 2012. 


Pfahler's work as a print and runway model is depicted in both photographs, publications, and press clippings in this series, including images depicting nudity, fetishism, BDSM, and other sexual situations. Modeling photographers include Rosalie Knox, Laure Leber, Rick Owens, and Richard Kern. This series also contains drawings, notes, press clippings, ephemera, and runway show photographs related to Pfahler's clothing line from the early 2000s. This series contains a small amount of personal correspondence and press clippings, as well as a significant amount of photographs of friends; family; first husband Samoa Morika; partner Colin de Land; childhood, teen, and adult portraits of Pfahler; and trips to Japan, Cape Cod, and Hawaii.</field>
