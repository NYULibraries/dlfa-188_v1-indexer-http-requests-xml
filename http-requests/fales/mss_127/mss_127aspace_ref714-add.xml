    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series comprises the records of all activities for the 2000 season--the final season of the Institute in this form. As in the previous series, the bulk of the records fall into two major groups: administrative files and applications. Administrative files contain materials on all aspects of running the Institute. Applications are divided in this series into those applicants who were appointed, tentative applicants who had passed the first and perhaps second screening, rejected applicants and applicants who passed an initial screening. There is also a group of applicant records that were received unclassified. They may duplicate applications in the other subseries but their status in the application process is otherwise unknown.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Additional material present in this series includes the report on the 2000 season, here present unbound in a series of folders; a set of files dealing with the appointment protocol; and a set of miscellaneous project material.</field>
