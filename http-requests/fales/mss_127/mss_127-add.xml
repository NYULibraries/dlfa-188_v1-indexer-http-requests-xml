    <field name="abstract_teim">The Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue was founded in 1997 by Anna Deavere Smith to support the development of those artworks and projects specifically concerned with social conditions and to foster dialogue between artists, activists, scholars and audiences that could both enhance the artworks and encourage a broader, more open exchange of ideas. The main activity of the Institute was the organization of three summer series where numerous works were created, staged, and discussed with the participation of volunteer audiences, teachers and professors, cultural critics and other guests. The collection consists of administrative records, artist applications, and records and documents of the artworks and theatrical productions.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The IACD Archive contains administrative records focused primarily on the practical issues of organizing the summer sessions for the years 1998, 1999, and 2000. Materials include correspondence, administrative hiring records, records for housing, intern applications and activities, budgets for the organization as well as for individual projects, and promotional materials.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The archive is organized into three main series by year. Further, each series is subdivided into appropriate subseries though these vary from year to year. Each year has a substantial main group of administrative records, organized alphabetically by folder title, and a group of artists' applications, organized alphabetically by the artist's last name. Other series present in only one year or another include production overviews, files originating from Anna Deavere Smith or concerning her work, a body of transcripts of meetings and discussion groups. Summary reports of all activities were produced for at least two years. For 1999, the bound report is located in series 2.10; for 2000, the disbound report is located in series 3.3.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For the summer season of 1998, participating artists included Donald Byrd, Dawoud Bey, Shu Lea Cheang, Michael Korie, Keith Antar Mason and Judy Baca. In 1999, invited artists included Ping Chong, Lee Breuer, Demetria Royals, Anita Gonzalez, Robbie McCauley, Bradley McCallum, Abderrahmane Sissako, Art Spiegelman, Merry Conway, Noni Pratt and the Girl's Choir of Harlem. The final year of 2000 featured such artists as Luis Alfaro, Suzzy Roche, Bill Bowers, Ysaye Barnwell, Dread Scott, and others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Among the records of the many productions produced over those three years are records relating to the development of House Arrest by Anna Deavere Smith. This work was presented as part of the Institute in the summer of 1998; it was staged at the Mark Taper Forum in the spring of 1999 and at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in 2000. Included in this collection are records relating to its development such as transcripts of group discussions, videotapes of its staging at the Institute and finally at the Public Theater.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue (IACD) was founded in 1997 by actress, playwright, and professor Anna Deavere Smith. Its mission was to support the development of art that illuminates social conditions; to deepen the capacity of artists to communicate with their audiences; and to build an international community in which artists, students, activists, and scholars could work together to develop the artist as a voice in society.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">From 1998 to 2000, Smith and The Ford Foundation, the Institute's principal funder, selected Harvard University as the IACD home base for six-week long summer intensives. Hosted by the University's American Repertory Theater and the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research, the Institute brought together artists, scholars, activists, and audiences to develop and discuss works of art about the vital social issues of our time. This unique "think-and-do-tank" presented workshop versions of productions, exposing the process of creation and fostering civic discourse on the themes expressed by the work.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Activities included development of new works of art, group discussions, guest speakers, seminars and workshops for participants and selected guests, collaborative research, master classes, public forums and media projects. The Institute's artistic focus included theater, dance, jazz music, song, opera, fine arts, installation and performance art, film and video. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While the Institute still exists today, it's activities have changed since relocating to New York City. As it's website, http://www.artsandcivicdialogue.org, states: "we are now redesigning the Institute with the intention to ignite a new generation of artists who will be able to combine skill, artistic virtuosity and the intellectual passion to pose powerful questions about the state of our world and the ever evolving human condition."</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">These records were donated to Fales Library and Special Collections by the Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue in 2002.</field>
