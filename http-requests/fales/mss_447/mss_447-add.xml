    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Queer Nation records document some of the protests, petitions, and demonstrations of the LGBT activist organization known as Queer Nation. More specifically, the collection's ephemera documents the organization's disapproval of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) for failing to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity by religiously-affiliated employers. Also documented within the collection is Queer Nation's Dump Russian Vodka campaign, which began in response to Russia's recent passage of repressive, anti-gay legislation. This campaign was especially important to the organization's desire for global awareness of LGBT discrimination during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Materials, which are mostly undated, include a banner, protest signs, flyers, invitations, and some smaller ephemera, including a candy necklace and a box of matches from Barcelona Wine Bar. Also included within the collection are a number of t-shirts with slogans, such as "Here, Queer, Fabulous," as well as "Queer Nation, Queer Planet."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Queer Nation is an LGBT activist organization founded in New York in 1990 by ACT UP members Tom Blewitt, Alan Klein, Michelangelo Signorile, and Karl Soehnlein as a means to eliminate homophobia and increase LGBT visibility worldwide. The group gained prominence for its "Nights Out" actions which, in response to violence and bigotry against the LGBT community in New York, were designed to raise the visibility of queer behavior in the city. In recent years, Queer Nation continues to protest against discriminatory practices in the United States and abroad, and advocates on behalf of worldwide LGBT issues, including affordable housing, corporate responsibility, and political inclusion.</field>
