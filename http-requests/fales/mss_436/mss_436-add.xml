    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection comprises correspondence sent to Nancy Woolley from Montanna Houston during the decade between 1975 and 1985. Houston wrote from Houston, Texas; Boulder, Colorado; and New York City to Woolley in Dallas, Texas. The letters are written on a variety of paper: construction paper, brown paper bags, as well as the backs of xeroxes that sometimes include his collages of newspaper and magazine clippings. Houston often wrote to Woolley concerning his interest in Aleister Crowley, Buddhism, Minimalism, as well as the people in the Cinema of Transgression, New Wave, No Wave and Punk scenes with whom he was working, such as Richard Kern and Nick Zedd. Houston uses ink stamps as signatures in both his letters and on his artwork. He also stylized his name as well as Woolley's, which often appears as Woollette or Woolleyburger. Occasionally he refers to her as "Pharaoh Queen."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to letters, Houston sent clippings from magazines and newspapers, xeroxed art, drawings done in ink, pencil and marker, collages, prayer cards and religious pamphlets, exhibit booklets, zines, poetry, as well as a few photographs, including one of Andy Warhol, 1 pressed leaf, and 1 poster for a New York performance entitled "Breaking the Mood, Stress Test II" for which he did the music. There are two issues of the zine done in collaboration with Richard Kern, Heroin Addict, a zine called How Magic Works with text by Houston and photographs by Kern, as well as one issue of Dumb Fucker, containing pieces by Kern, David Wojnarowicz, Tommy Turner and others. The drawings are mostly self portraits of Houston, but also include a character he called "The Prince of Darkness." The largest piece, "Montanna Reveals All," is a series of xeroxes of his body taped together to form a larger than life self portrait.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born Monte Hewson (circa 1952-1990), Montana Houston (which he also stylized as Montanna, Montini, and Montanna Hewston) was an artist, musician, writer, and contemporary of David Wojnarowicz, Richard Kern and Tommy Turner. Houston was raised by an adoptive family, whom he referred to as his step-family, and spent his childhood in Texas. After moving to New York in his mid-twenties, he met and became friends with Kern and Turner around 1979, and then later met Wojnarowicz through the two filmmakers. Houston acted in Kern's Stray Dogs (1985) as well as Where Evil Dwells (1985), an unfinished Turner and Wojnarowicz film, in which he was cast as Satan (Joe Coleman is also credited as this character). Houston also contributed to many of Turner and Kern's zines. For most of his adult life, Houston lived with mental health issues and severe substance use. He left New York in 1986 to return to Houston, Texas, where his adoptive family still lived, and checked himself into West Oak Hospital for treatment. The twelve-step program he took part in there was an important part to his recovery from addiction. Houston died by suicide in 1990.</field>
