    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This video consists of performance footage and interviews with Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Liz Naylor of Catcall Records from March and April 1993, when Bikini Kill and Huggy Bear were on tour in the United Kingdom. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Naylor discusses a Huggy Bear and Bikini Kill show at TJs in Newport, Wales on March 8th 1993 in which Hanna used male bouncers to ensure the safety of female fans from abusive men in the audience. Naylor also talks about the bands re-approaching the performer-audience relationship; fanzines as a democratic and inexpensive medium; the barriers to entry into the music industry; misogyny within the music industry; the meaning of riot grrrl, and about the importance of documenting women's history.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hanna and Naylor listen to a recording of the Bikini Kill and Huggy Bear show in Newport, Wales, and discuss abusive men in the crowd at a show at the Warehouse in Derby, England on March 15th 1993. The Newport show features an impromptu chant of 'Rebel Girl' from the crowd, as well as Hanna ejecting a man for throwing beer on other people. Hanna discusses being verbally abused at a show in Boston from a man who also punched her roadie Laura. That same man went on to murder a woman with a gun. Hanna talks about the importance of combatting misogyny at shows, since it is perpetuated by the same men who violently assault women outside of shows. Hanna and Naylor argue over the role of agents in the booking process and the nature of artistic self-management.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The tape ends with footage of Bikini Kill performing at the Bull &amp; Gate in Kentish Town, London, England on April 3rd 1993. The show features Kathleen Hanna reading a poem entitled Ragdoll, in which she argues against magazines such as NME and Melody Maker. Post-show footage in the women's bathrooms at the Bull &amp; Gate features female fans discussing the meaning of Riot Grrrl and the politics of wearing makeup.</field>
