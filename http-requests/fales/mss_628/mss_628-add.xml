    <field name="abstract_teim">Kim Fielding (d. 2014) was a Welsh artist, photographer, and curator. His photography and other artwork was provactive and confrontational, often employing bondage, covering models with subtances, or putting models in enclosed containers. Fielding also used his photography to document the arts communities he was part of, including Berlin, New York, and South America, in addition to his home in Cardiff. While living in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s, Fielding was a regular presence in the downtown arts scene, waited tables in the East Village, bartended at Cave Canem (the basement of Lucky Cheng's), and photographed the larger cultural moment he was a part of. The Kim Fielding Photographs (dated 1972-2002) consist primarily of photographic materials created by Fielding documenting the period of his life in New York City, and his engagement with the downtown arts scene in the 1980s and 1990s. Materials include photographic negatives, contact sheets, slides, and prints of candid images from gallery openings, clubs, events such as the East Village drag festival Wigstock, and other venues, such as PS 122, La Mama, The Kitchen, and Darinka: A Performance Studio. The collection also includes posed photographs taken by Fielding, some of which are pornographic. Notable figures from the downtown arts scene documented in the collection include Carlo McCormick, Joey Arias, Richard Kern, George Petros, and Ruby Ray, amongst others. The collection also includes a small amount of audio and video recordings.</field>
