Standing in tribute in the court of hazÅ«r (Sir) who is a treasure of grace, and has Aristotle's intellect. Who is in a position of decree, with highness in degree and rank, grandeur stature, and is the most virtuous of people. The fountain from where wisdom and knowledge springs, whose flag is high,
respectable of the gods, I mean, Sir William Younus (Jones),may his great shade prolong.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">It is delivered, God willing. May the God of all the worlds, keep the age and wealth of that king green and fresh for 150 years. And I am and I have been busy continuously praying and praising for Sir's blessed self. I hope my prayer reaches the target like an arrow, by the Grace of the God of servants. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">After expressing my sincerity, my disclosed opinion may not remain hidden from the bright self of that Sir (William Jones). May you have the best of times, and the most blessed moments. With that letter, from the praiseful pen, Sir (William Jones) honored this man (the author of the letter) in that sun-like document containing well-doings of the praised personality of that Sir (William Jones). And the good news of wellness of the carrier of innocence and immaculacy, offspring of the royals,famous in all the land and sea, Mary of the times, Miss Lady Jones, may God prolong her good luck. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hope you receive this letter in times of happiness and moments of luck. I hope your time will be with ease and without burden.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Words of the text that Mr Amin delivered to me, the sirafraz namcha (chapter), was a manuscript in Pahlavi language and handwritten. He has put all his effort and says this is a chapter, however I remember very little of it. God willing, as per your wish, I will write back to you in detail, when my
senses are working better, so you can see it as well.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">I am so excited to meet you (I am passionate about kissing your feet), that to describe it with pen in a letter is impossible. I wanted to write a letter earlier but there is an ancient tradition amongst Persian people that when an individual leaves for a destination, his family will not write to him until they receive a letter from him first.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As your letter has reached now I am encouraged to write back and express in your presence with hopeful request that you will honor this humble well-wisher with two blessed words of mercy (for me).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This will be the reason for you to pray and a reason for my heart's contentment. This will be the most minimal outcome. And may your wealth/riches last forever.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The letter is written on the date of 30th September 1786 AD, at the port of Calcutta at the house of Mr Amin Sahab. May my offer of sincerity be delivered in the presence of Her Highness who is at the Queen's stature, the Mary of the times, the one and only lady Jones Sahiba (Miss), may she stay well forever Inshaa Allah (God-willing), may your orders remain obeyed.</field>
