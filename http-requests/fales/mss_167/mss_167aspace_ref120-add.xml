    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV: Writings is divided into five subseries according to genre. Subseries A contains Sellers' short stories, poems and plays, organized alphabetically. Subseries B includes Sellers' novels, organized alphabetically by title. These materials also include research for each project including notes, manuscripts, drafts, proofs, and promotion and publication materials. Subseries C contains original artwork by Jeffrey Bretschneider and Carl Apfelschnitt that was produced to illustrate editions of her published work. Subseries D is a scrapbook that Sellers created of clippings from magazines and newspapers relating to her life and literary career. Subseries E includes copies of Sellers' published essays and prose works, including various editions of works. Original folders are also included with most of the work in this series because in many instances Sellers took notes and brainstormed on her original folders. All work is arranged alphabetically by project.</field>
