    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jazz musician, composer, artist, and educator William (Bill) Robert Dixon was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts in 1925. Around the age of seven, he and his family moved to Harlem, New York. Dixon studied painting at Boston University, the WPA Arts School, and the Art Students League, working in a variety of mediums. Dixon served in the Army during World War II in Germany from 1944-1946, and later studied music at the Hartnett Conservatory of Music from 1946-1951 where he played trumpet, flugelhorn, and piano. 


While living in New York in the 1950s, Dixon worked as an international civil servant at the United Nations and helped found the UN Jazz Society. Dixon also worked clubs as a performing musician in Greenwich Village during this time. In 1964, Dixon organized and produced a four-day festival of underexposed talent, the October Revolution in Jazz, including music and discussions, which led to him founding the short-lived cooperative organization of creative improvising New York musicians known as the Jazz Composers Guild. 


In 1966, he began a collaborative partnership with dancer and choreographer Judith Dunn, which eventually led to him joining the faculty at Bennington College as a professor. Dixon founded the Black Music Division in the 1970s at Bennington. He assembled and led the Division's faculty and wrote the curriculum until his retirement from Bennington in 1995. While at Bennington, he taught classes in a variety of related subjects including improvisation, composition, and performance. He was director of the Black Music Ensemble. From 1971-1972, Dixon was a visiting professor of Music at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He retired from Bennington College in 1996.


In addition to his work as an educator, Dixon continued to record music and perform among other improvisational jazz musicians. He played alongside Archie Shepp, Cecil Taylor, William Parker and other musicians of the avant-garde jazz scene. He worked for fifty years as a recording artist, crafting solo music for trumpet, ensemble, dance collaborations, and orchestras. He recorded with record labels RCA, Cadence Jazz Records, and Soul Note, and founded his own publishing company, Metamorphosis Music. In 1967, he composed and conducted a score for the United States Information Agency film The Wealth of a Nation, produced and directed by William Greaves. In 1980, Dixon completed his first tour in Italy, where he would return to record the albums In Italy, Vol I and II, and Considerations, Vol I and II. In 2007, Dixon recorded 17 Musicians in Search of a Sound: Darfur at the New York City Vision Festival to bring attention to the genocide of Sudan's South Darfur region.


Dixon was also an artist working in various mediums including painting, printmaking, drawing, and collage. He often used his visual art on album covers. As an author, he published the book L'Opera: A Collection of Letters, Writings, Musical Scores, Drawings, and Photographs in 1986. He also wrote reviews and articles, and contributed to other books about jazz.
