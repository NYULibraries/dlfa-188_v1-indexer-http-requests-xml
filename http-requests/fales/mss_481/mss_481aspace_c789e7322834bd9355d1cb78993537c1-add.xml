    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries contains paper and digital files related to Bill Dixon as a musician and composer during the 1960s to the 2000s including the creation of his musical albums, original musical works, and performances.


Dixon recorded albums from the early 1960s to 2009. Files related to these albums in this subseries include liner note drafts, recording session notes, album publicity material, and mock-ups and images for albums, some of which contain Dixon's original artwork. 
This subseries also contains images, ephemera, and program notes related to Dixon's performances as a solo performer and in groups including the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival with dancer Judith Dunn, the orchestra practice for Dixon's original soundtrack for the movie Wealth of a Nation, and University of the Streets performances and rehearsals. Files in this subseries also include information on tours and jazz festivals throughout Italy, Germany, Israel, France, and Canada during the 1980s through 2000s. Musicians Dixon often toured with include Tony Oxley, Cecil Taylor, Mario Pavone, and Laurence Cook.


Dixon's work as a composer is documented through a large collection of handwritten music manuscripts and program notes on individual works including "Autumn Sequences, from A Paris Diary: Fall 1976", "For Franz", "For Cecil Taylor", "Index: A Work for Large Ensemble", "Letters: Round Up the Usual Suspects", "Metamorphosis", and "Winter Song, 1964". A portion of the music manuscripts are untitled and include new compositions and exercises for student ensembles.


The subseries also contains a small collection of files accumulated on the publishing companies Dixon used, including BMI, EMI, IREC, and his own company, Metamorphosis. These files typically include correspondence and reports regarding music rights, royalties, and album production. Heavily annotated reference books on trumpet performance and composition are also in this subseries.</field>
