    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes material related to Dixon's work as both a visual artist and writer. 
Original artworks in this series include photography, collage, prints, painting, and drawings. Many of his ink and pencil drawings in this series were rendered on envelopes, concert programs, and Bennington College meeting minutes and memos. Files in this series often contain a combination of artworks, reproductions, and source material stored as they were originally in his studio. Objects in this series relating to the creation of these works include printing blocks, an etching plate, and linoleum block sheets. Dixon would often use printed images of his artworks to create collages. These reproductions and collages are in this series. Exhibition-related files, sketchbooks, and promotional presentation books are also in this series. One notable project was with URDLA (Union Regionale pour le Development de la Lithnographie d'Art) in Lyon, France in January and February 1994 where works on paper created previously by Dixon were produced as lithographs and shown in various exhibitions. This series contains correspondence, notes, and images of this process and the finished works. His artworks were not only shown in exhibitions and sold to collectors, but also used for his album covers. Files on these albums can be found in Series I.C.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Dixon wrote articles, reviews, book contributions, and liner notes for fellow musicians' albums dating from the 1950s to the 2000s. Many of his writings pertain to his experiences as a jazz musician, compositions, and relationships with other musicians. This series contains original publications as well as work files on many of his writings. Work files for his book L'Opera: A Collection of Letters, Writings, Musical Scores, Drawings, and Photographs (1967-1986) contain notes, drafts, mock-ups, correspondence, and the book itself. Also of note are his writings regarding his partnership with the choreographer Judith Dunn with whom he collaborated in the 1960s and 1970s.</field>
