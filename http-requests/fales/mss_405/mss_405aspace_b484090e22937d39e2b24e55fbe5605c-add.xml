    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains Polansky's correspondence and subject files, personal audiocassette collection, clippings, groups of backed up computer files, and an archived version of his website.
Polansky's correspondence and subject files comprise a large portion of the paper files in this series, containing correspondence with colleagues and friends within the modern music field, including Christian Wolff, James Tenney, Kenneth Gaburo, and Anita Feldman. These files also contain Polansky's subject and research files on specific composers, theories, and funding ideas. This series contains a significant number of clippings from the 1970s to the 2000s on Polansky and his work, including profiles, reviews of albums and performances, and his work with Frog Peak Music.
This series also contains Polansky's regularly backed up computer files which remain grouped by the date of the backup. Files found within these backups range in date from the 1980s to the 2000s, including a mixture of both personal and professional files. Personal computer files include correspondence and calendar entries, while professional-related materials include album recording information, teaching-related material, and other projects. His archived website includes a complete list of his scores, audio recordings, and document files including writings and special projects. 
Polansky's personal audiocassette collection contains commercial and homemade recordings of work by friends and colleagues, many of which are not widely distributed. These recordings range in date from the 1970s to 2000s. Polansky's audition and college senior concert audio recordings from the late 1970s can also be found in this series.</field>
