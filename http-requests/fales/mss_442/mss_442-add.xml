    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Chris Kraus Papers document Kraus's career as a writer, art critic, editor, filmmaker, writing instructor, playwright, and theatre director.  The collection dates from 1975 through 2015 and contains paper, born-digital, and audiovisual materials documenting her work through this time.  These materials include drafts of Kraus's plays, films, novels, and critical writings; research materials used in her work; video, audio, and film recordings for her films; correspondence with friends and collaborators; and Kraus's personal diaries.  Well documented in the collection is her work as a writer of fiction and non-fiction, and as a filmmaker.  The collection includes her autobiographical novels I Love Dick, Torpor, and Summer of Hate.  Kraus's work on these novels is documented through paper and born-digital material, including diary entries regarding experiences that served as the basis for the novels, notes and drafts, research and source materials, galley proofs, publicity and reviews, and correspondence regarding all aspects of the creative process.  Similar material for her critical art writing and films is included in the collection, particularly the collections of her critical writing, Video Green:  Los Angeles Art and the Triumph of Nothingness and Where Art Belongs; her biography After Kathy Acker; and her films Golden Bowl or Repression and Gravity and Grace.  Also included in the collection are paper and born-digital typescripts, notes, and publicity materials for her plays and theatre work, as well as video, audio, and film recordings of these performances.  Also in the collection are correspondence, drafts, and notes documenting Kraus's work as a co-editor at Semiotext(e) and material from The Chance Event, a three day event curated by Kraus in Nevada in 1996 that focused on philosophy, music, and culture.</field>

She is best known for her autobiographical novel, I Love Dick.   From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, she worked in New York City as a playwright and theatre director.  She wrote and directed the plays Disparate Action/Desperate Action and Readings from the Diaries of Hugo Ball, and co-wrote I Talked about God with Antonin Artaud with Sylv√®re Lotringer.  They later collaborated on the film How to Shoot a Crime.  Kraus was married to Lotringer from the late 1980s through the late 1990s.  While working in theatre in the early 1980s, Kraus began to write and produce short films.  These include The Golden Bowl or Repression and Gravity and Grace.  In 1990, she started as co-editor with Lotringer at Semiotext(e), a journal and small publishing house he founded 1974, and she started the Native Agents Series there at the time.  At the time of this writing (2019), Kraus was still co-editor at Semiotext(e).   In the late 1990s, she moved to Los Angeles, California and began focusing on art criticism, fiction writing, and teaching.
