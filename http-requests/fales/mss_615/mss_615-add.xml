    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Feminist Art Institute (NYFAI) was founded 1979 by Miriam Schapiro, Carol Stonghilos, Nancy Azara, Irene Peslikis, Lucille Lessane, and Selena Whitefeather to create an environment for the training of women in the arts. NYFAI was active as a school from 1979-1990, and the Ceres Gallery exhibited their work. In 1993, the organization ceased operations. In the 2000s, founders, faculty, students and others major participants in NYFAI were interviewed as part of an oral history project. In addition, a travelling exhibit, Visual Diaries, was curated based on Nancy Azara's Consciousness Raising Workshop in circa 2010.</field>
