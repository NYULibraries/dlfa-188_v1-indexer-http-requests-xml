    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born on March 27, 1936 in Brooklyn NY, Malcolm Goldstein attended Columbia University from 1952 through 1959 where he studied with Otto Leuning and Antonio Miranda. In 1962 he began performing with the Judson Dance Theater, shortly followed by participation in the NY Festival of the Avant Garde and the Experimental Intermedia Foundation. In 1963 he co-founded the Tone Roads chamber ensemble with Philip Corner and James Tenney. Tone Roads, which takes its name from a mid-career composition by Charles Ives, showcased works by Ives, Ruggles, Cage, and Varese. Goldstein went on to work on a critical edition of Ives' work. He also wrote extensively about these musicians as well as about improvisation. He is the author of the book Sounding the Full Circle distributed by Frog Peak Music. He has traveled extensively, performing in countries around the world, and has received many awards including the Prix Acustica International by WDR. </field>
