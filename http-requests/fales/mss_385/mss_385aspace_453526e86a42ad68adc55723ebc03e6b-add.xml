    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains working files related to published and unpublished writings by Kupferberg, dating from the early 1940s to the early 2000s. Materials in this series provide a glimpse into Kupferberg's creative process and working style through his manuscripts, typescripts, notes, outlines, electronic records, and source material. His early works from the 1940s and 1950s include college coursework papers and early publication submissions, many using variations on his name, including Norman Kupferberg, Naftali Kupferberg, Norman Cooper, Arab Kupa, and Tuli Kupferberg. Of note is an unpublished manuscript from the 1940s, The Novel, which is believed to be an autobiographical account of Kupferberg's teen and college years. Scrapbooks within this series contain clippings of some of his early published writings. 
Kupferberg often self-published through his company, Birth Press, including his popular parody song lyric book, Listen to the Mockingbird, (1973) of which this series includes his illustrations, drafts, and source material for all five editions. This series also contains images, notes, and reviews for the books As They Were (1973) and As They Were Too (1979), which were in collaboration with Sylvia Topp. Chapter outlines and drafts for his unpublished novel The Fucks (inspired by Kupferberg's band The Fugs) can also be found in this series. He also wrote for many underground and mainstream publications, including a column, Dope Lore, for High Times magazine, of which this series contains source material, and reader letters. 
A large collection of notes, drafts, and source material related to Kupferberg's poems and newspoems, which were poems inspired by news clippings, can be found in this series, ranging in date from the 1940s to the early 2000s.
Kupferberg often accumulated research information for his writings on notecards, and this series contains cards for 1001 Ways to Make Love and notes for First Glance: Childhood Creations of the Famous, as well as ideas for Dope Lore. Small notebooks kept throughout his life in which he recording writing ideas, quotes, and general thoughts can also be found in this series. 
Material specifically related to Kupferberg's Birth Press publications can also be found in Series V.</field>
