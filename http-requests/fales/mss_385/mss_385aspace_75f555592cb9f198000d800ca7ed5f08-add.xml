    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains letters from friends and colleagues, many who were notable political figures, artists, writers involved in the arts scene in New York and internationally during the 1960s through 1990s, including Sam Abrams, Al Aronowitz, Coby Batty, Lenni Brenner, Noam Chomsky, Diane di Prima, Royston Ellis, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Urban Gwerder, Harry Hooton, Ted Joans, LeRoi Jones, Walter Lowenfels, Arthur Moyse, Anais Nin, Genesis P-Orridge, Sparrow, Ed Sanders, Rebby Sharp, Robin Tatham, Allen Tobias, and Judith Wehlau. This series also contains writing and music samples from admirers as well as reader responses and suggestions to Kupferberg's works. A significant section of the series contains general correspondence in paper and electronic records, grouped by decade, received from friends, fans, and publishers. This series also contains fan mail for his band The Fugs and for Kupferberg himself. The largest portion of the fan mail dates from the 1960s and documents the thoughts, issues, and activities of young people during the 1960s, living in the United States, as well as internationally. Kupferberg appears to have responded regularly to these fan letters. Also of note in this series are responses and reader suggestions regarding Kupferberg's Dope Lore column, which ran through the early 1980s and was primarily about drug use. The letters within this series are mostly those received by Kupferberg, except for a few folders specifically noted as written by him, and a few of his notes and responses scattered throughout the files. This series also includes a small amount of limited-circulation publications, usually attached to letters from publishers with whom Kupferberg exchanged his own publications. Correspondence regarding Birth Press can be found in Series V.</field>
