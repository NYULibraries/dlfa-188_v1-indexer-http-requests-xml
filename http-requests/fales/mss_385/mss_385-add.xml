    <field name="abstract_teim">Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg (1923-2010) was an American counterculture poet, cartoonist, publisher, activist, and musician. This collection reflects the varied, interconnected assortment of projects Kupferberg undertook beginning in the 1940s until his death in 2010, while living in lower Manhattan. Material in this collection includes essays, articles, and books by Kupferberg and his wife Sylvia Topp; work files for his and Topp's publishing company, Birth Press; fan mail, song lyrics, and recordings related to his band, The Fugs; props for his performance group, The Revolting Theater; and recordings of his local television show, Revolting News. His correspondence with authors including Sparrow, Urban Gwerder, Ted Joans, Walter Lowenfels, and Coby Batty, provide perspective into the network and relationships among the literary bohemian community within New York and beyond during the 1960s through 2000s.

The bulk of the collection is Kupferberg's extensive research and source material grouped into subjects including sex, politics, smoking, religion, drugs, and education. Material within these subject files were used as inspiration or incorporated into works he wrote and performed. His significant collection of local, small-run independent published material as well as mainstream publications illustrates the output of writers and artists during these decades, and represents the interests of readers within the New York community and beyond.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of over 60 years of material generated by Tuli Kupferberg through his writings; music lyrics; cartoons and collages; sound and video recordings; performance props; and publications. His work was often inspired by political and social issues, including protesting Vietnam War in music lyrics and cartoons, criticizing a Presidential administration in Birth Press publications and his Revolting News television show, and discussing the drug culture in his Dope Lore magazine columns. Kupferberg corresponded with many writers and poets active in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, which provides a view into the literary community during these decades, including Sparrow, Urban Gwerder, Ted Joans, Walter Lowenfels, and Coby Batty. These correspondents discussed submissions to Kupferberg and Topp's Birth Press publications, shared their own publications, and updated Kupferberg on news of their families as well as mutual friends. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Fugs material in this collection illustrates the development of a band active in the 1960s through promotional advertisements, flyers, and set lists, performing primarily in local New York area clubs. The band's popularity spread beyond the bohemian and hippie population of the New York area and expanded throughout the United States as well as internationally, illustrated through concert tour planning files and fan mail addressed to both Kupferberg and band co-founder Ed Sanders. Their music was initially focused on protesting against the Vietnam War, but eventually evolved into general political satire, which can be traced through their set lists and published/unpublished recordings found in this collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A significant portion of this collection is Kupferberg's extensive research and source material accumulated throughout his life and grouped into subject headings such as humor, sex, religion, education, war, and politics. These files contained clippings, articles, print advertisements, illustrations, photographs, and political cartoons, ranging in date from the late 1800s to 2010. These files were used by Kupferberg in his collages and publications, but also as visual elements in performances with The Fugs, Revolting Theater, and his solo act, many helping to convey his satirical interpretations on politics, sex, war, and drug use. Along with these source files, his collection of small-run publications represents the literary and artistic output of lower Manhattan writers and artists from the 1950s to the mid-2000s, while his collection of wider-circulated publications provide a broader view of popular culture nationally and internationally during the same time period.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg (1923-2010) was an American counterculture poet, publisher, performance artist, cartoonist, activist, and founding member of the underground rock band, The Fugs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
He grew up in Manhattan and attended Brooklyn College, graduating in 1944. Before graduating from college, Kupferberg had already become active in the literary and political scenes in downtown New York City, publishing poems, short stories, and essays in local journals and newspapers, including the The Village Voice, Midstream, and Liberation. He also drew cartoons and collages beginning in the 1950s, his earliest work including drawings with captions of witty, altered aphorisms, which were accepted in a number of publications and in book form.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Throughout his life, Kupferberg was also known for being politically active, participating in protests and rallies; during his appearances with his band The Fugs; his published articles, as well as co-authoring a satirical anti-war book 1001 Ways to Beat the Draft (1966) with Robert Bashlow.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Kupferberg met Sylvia Topp (1935- ) in 1957 and were together until his death in 2010. Initially, they lived together in the East Village, starting a publishing company, Birth Press (also known as Vanity Press) in the late 1950s, working out of their apartment. They published not only Kupferberg's works, but other authors of this period as well. Between 1958 and 1965 they released a number of publications from the Birth Press imprint, including the zines Birth, Yeah, and Swing, as well as the collage-and-quotation-assemblages 1001 Ways to Live Without Working; Beatniks: or, The War Against the Beats; The Rub-ya-out of Omore Diem; The Christine Keeler Colouring Book &amp; Cautionary Tale; The Mississippi (A Study of the White Race); and Children As Authors: A Big Bibliography. Topp and Kupferberg also edited a number of mainstream reference books, including As They Were, As They Were Too, and First Glance: Childhood Creations of the Famous.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Simultaneously his cartoons and articles were also being accepted in publications like The Soho Weekly News, The Village Voice, and High Times. Throughout this time, Topp worked as a freelance copy editor for various publishing houses, including Grove Press and Academic Press, which also published Kupferberg's material. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Kupferberg was also involved in the New York music scene, becoming a founding member of the rock band, The Fugs, in 1964 with poet Ed Sanders and Ken Weaver. The Fugs performed in galleries, clubs, and theaters throughout New York; recorded six albums; and toured regularly. The Fugs' involvement in counter cultural politics and the anti-war movement enabled Kupferberg to be present at a number of seminal events, including the 1967 March on Washington and 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
During the early 1970s, while on a break from The Fugs, Kupferberg, along with Sylvia Topp, formed a satirical experimental theatrical group called the Revolting Theater. The material originated from Kupferberg's 1966 solo album, No Deposit, No Return. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Kupferberg also appeared as an actor in a number of movies: W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism (1971) depicting the life and work of Wilhelm Reich; Kupferberg and Revolting Theater members performed a sketch in the Richard Pryor film Dynamite Chicken (1972); and he starred in the Canadian experimental feature film Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec God? (1972).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Kupferberg began writing what he described as "parasongs" in the 1970s, which consisted of new lyrics adapted to known melodies. Many were published in his 1973 book, Listen to the Mockingbird, which had multiple editions over the next 20 years.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
In 1989 Kupferberg became involved with television, producing a show with Lannes Kenfield, Theater of the Real. They went on to make the show, Revolting News, broadcast on a local New York City community channel starting in 1992, on which he delivered satirical "newspoems" and "perverbs," and discussed a variety of topics, including Judaism, sexuality, spiritualism, and militarism. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Throughout the 1990s, Kupferberg sold cartoons, books, and records from a table on the sidewalk of Spring Street near his New York apartment. Until his death in 2010, he videotaped and posted online readings and performances of his works, as well as continued to draw and write, with many regularly published in newspapers and magazines.</field>
