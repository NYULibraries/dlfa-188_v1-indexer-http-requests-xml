    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains files related to Kupferberg's numerous performance, theatrical, and musical projects, including his involvement in the Revolting Theater; Revolting News television show; and local and international appearances. 
Kupferberg's parasongs (a song using new and original lyrics set to an older, popular melody) were often used during solo and group performances as well as printed in a variety of publications. Parasong files make up the largest section of this series, containing lyric sheets, notes and source material. These files overlap with parasongs found in files for various editions of Kupferberg and Sylvia Topp's book, Listen to the Mockingbird, found in Series I. and V.
This series also contains performance recordings; recorded sound effects; setlists; photographs; posters; clippings; and event announcements for the Revolting Theater group, dating from the early 1970s to the 2000s. Posters, flyers, clippings, and sound recordings (some unreleased) related to Kupferberg's solo appearances such as poetry readings and musical events can also be found in this series. 
Photographs in this series include street scenes around Lower Manhattan during the 1960s, images of friends, political protests, and parties. Kupferberg performance photographs at poetry readings, concerts, etc., are also found in this series.
A significant number of files on the Vagabond's Codebook, possibly a failing book project taken over by Kupferberg or Sylvia Topp can also be found in this series.
The series also contains sound recordings of Kupferberg readings and concerts; Revolting News television episode from 2008; interviews; songs; answering machine messages; and audio letters from friends. These recordings can be found on audiocassettes, audio reels, and record albums. This series also contains 16mm film titled Good Soldier.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Thirteen audio cassettes were deaccessioned due to excessive bug and dirt infestation. One blank audio reel and three 16mm film reels were also deaccessioned. Additionally, one audio reel not created by Kupferberg  was deemed out of scope and deaccessioned.</field>
