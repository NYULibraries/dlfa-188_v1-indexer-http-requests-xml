    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gary Indiana (real name Gary Hoisington) was born in 1950 and brought up in Derry, New Hampshire. He and an older brother were raised by his parents, Cecile and Carol Hoisington. In his twenties, he moved to Berkeley and changed his name to Indiana. After two years, Indiana relocated to Boston, where he worked in various capacities before returning to California, this time to Los Angeles where he wrote for punk zines. After a 1974 car accident, he decided to leave for New York, where he became immersed in the downtown arts scene.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the 1980s, Indiana wrote for Artforum and Art in America, among other magazines. He also acted in a number of German and American films, notably working with Dieter Schidor and other members of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's circle. From 1984 onward, Indiana wrote art criticism for the Village Voice, establishing the uncompromising journalistic style that would become his trademark. During this time he was also very active in the theater, working closely with Bill Rice and Taylor Mead, among others, in both his own plays and others'. Notable plays by Indiana include Alligator Girls Go to College (1979), Curse of the Dog People (1980), Phantoms of Louisiana (1981), The Roman Polanski Story (1981), and Roy Cohn/Jack Smith (1992).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the late '80s, Indiana published two short story collections, Scar Tissue and Other Stories (1987) and White Trash Boulevard (1988), immediately followed by his first novel, Horse Crazy (1989). In addition to his critical writing, Indiana published novels throughout the 1990s, often writing fictionalized accounts of real-life murder cases like that of Andrew Cunanan in 1999's Three Month Fever.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Indiana continues to publish fiction work and write for a variety of publications on art, film, literature, and politics. The Guardian has called Indiana "one of the most important chroniclers of the American psyche." </field>
