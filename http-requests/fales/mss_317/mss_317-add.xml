    <field name="bioghist_teim">Kirk Winslow was born in 1955 in Beirut, Lebanon, the son of Maryette Charlton and Hall Winslow. Two years later, his family moved to  Manhattan, where he lived most of his life. He attended the Putney School in Vermont and spent time in Europe in the 1970s. He earned a BFA in Cinema Studies from New York University and became a filmmaker and photographer, developing close ties to several well-known artists of the late 20th century.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Winslow published an article on the films of Gregory J. Markopoulos, in whom he had a life-long interest, in Millennium Film Journal in 1998 and presented a Markopoulos retrospective in Germany in 1999. He held a rare public screening of his films at the Robert Beck Memorial Cinema one year before his death. A later series of films by Markopoulos and Robert Beavers was dedicated to Winslow's memory. Kirk Winslow died in Manhattan in 2002.</field>
