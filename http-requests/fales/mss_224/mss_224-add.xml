    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection provides a glimpse of life in Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the downtown arts scene that emerged in the 1970s through the early 1990s. Materials include Dix's professional resume and her friend, Kevin Stevens' resume; Dix's birth certificate, her parents' marriage license and certificate, and her father's birth and naturalization certificates; annotated and handwritten original writings that included sketches; clippings and articles regarding NYC cultural events, book reviews, diseases, nutrition, and healthy living; postage stamps; brochures regarding oxygen therapy; utility bills and receipts; event flyers from downtown literary and theater events; notebooks that contain Dix's personal thoughts and feelings and general notes related to work; day planners; and photographs of unidentified men and women, and a few headshots. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the collection includes Dix's writings and correspondence that document her daily life in New York City between 1986 and 2001, and address numerous topics including her personal relationships with men, specifically a man named John; theater; politics and terrorism; cigarettes and smoking; her mother's death; issues she had with people she lived with and their neighbors; frustrations with her writing not being published; working as a caregiver for a woman named Ruth and their daily visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; drugs; music; fashion; book reviews; New York Times articles; and her physical and mental health. Dix's most notable writing in the collection is a piece she wrote entitled "Betty Boop: A Feminist Timeline," where Dix describes a fictional account of Betty Boop's life growing up. Much of her writing is present in her correspondence with friends and literary professionals. The majority of correspondence includes letters to and from Dix's friends in England, John and Sue; Teofilo "Teo" R. Ruiz, a Brooklyn College professor she worked with; and letters to medical professionals. Many of Dix's letters to medical professionals were addressed to physicians and expressed her concerns regarding the problems with her lungs and her interactions with doctors and nurses at various medical facilities. </field>
