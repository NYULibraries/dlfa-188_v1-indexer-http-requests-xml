    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born in Brattleboro, Vermont, Scot Borofsky graduated from Rhode Island School of Design and Painting in 1981, and received a Max Beckman Painting Scholarship at The Brooklyn Museum where he worked for one year. Borofsky first achieved notoriety in the New York art world for his 25 spray paintings made in the East Village during the early 80s, and from the subsequent spray paintings that were shown at the Mokotoff Gallery during the remainder of that decade. The artist left New York to return to his native Vermont in 1991. During the 90s, besides raising two boys, organic farming, and working in various fields of specialized construction, Borofsky nurtured his "graffiti symbols" into a mature style of oil painting. </field>
