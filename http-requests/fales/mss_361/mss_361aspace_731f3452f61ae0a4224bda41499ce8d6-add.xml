    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries contains Lally's writing files for published and unpublished works, notecards tracking his published works (1960s to 2009), and files related to his publishing ventures, O Press and Some of Us Press (SOUP). His work files on individual pieces and books typically contain notes, manuscripts, contracts, proofs, publicity, and correspondence, including files for The South Orange Sonnets, Catch My Breath, It Takes One to Know One, and It's Not Nostalgia. These work files also contain larger editing projects, including his work on the anthology None of the Above: New Poets of the USA which included works by L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets Ron Silliman, Bruce Andrews, and Ray DiPalma; New York School poets Alice Notley and Joe Brainard; and poets working outside any community association such as Patti Smith. Files containing unpublished loose poems are in this subseries, as well as chronological poetry manuscript books dating from the 1950s through the 1980s, his journals with writing ideas, and Lally's reviews of others' work. This subseries contains files on his first published piece Markings on the Wall including rejection slips, manuscript, and correspondence from the 1960s. Files with his unpublished biographies Loose Canon and Poor Moth Boy in the Moon are in this subseries. Lally's editorial work is also represented through his Franklin Library files and Venice Magazine files, which include photographs by musician Andy Summers.</field>
