    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Michael Lally Papers contains material on both Lally's professional and personal life. This material includes a significant collection of correspondence specifically related to Lally's involvement with the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets during their formative years, with small publishers, and with people in the poetry communities in Iowa City, Washington, D.C., and New York City during the 1970s through the 2000s.  
Lally's writing files include his manuscripts and drafts for poetry books and articles, as well as working files on his publishing companies, O Press and Some of Us Press (SOUP). A mix of paper and electronic files relate to his poetry readings through posters, publicity, and images from events. Small press publications and alternative journals in this collection contain many of Lally's writings, dating from the late 1960s through the 1990s, reflecting the output of poetry and literary communities during this time. Acting scripts, movie and play posters, publicity, and analog and digital audiovisual material represent Lally's work as an actor and screenwriter in Los Angeles during the 1980s through the 2000s. Personal journals, scrapbooks, calendars, address books, school yearbooks and papers, digital photographs, and correspondence with family and friends date from the 1950s to the 2000s.

An archived version of Lally's blog, http://lallysalley.blogspot.com/ where, as of 2019, he writes daily reflections on matters ranging from his personal life, movies, and politics to poetry. The blog was first captured in June 2019.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Michael Lally (1942- ) was born and raised in New Jersey. He joined the Air Force in 1962 and after four years left the service. Through the G.I. Bill he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Iowa. In 1969, he moved to Washington, D.C. to teach at Trinity College. While in D.C. he became involved in the local poetry scene, where he established the Mass Transit poetry reading series which was considered an important incubator for Language Poetry, and launched a poetry publishing collective, Some of Us Press (SOUP) with wife Lee Lally, Ed Cox, and Tina Darragh. SOUP published Lally's book,  The South Orange Sonnets, in 1972. In 1975 Lally separated from his first wife, the poet Lee Lally, and moved to New York, where he wrote poetry; founded a small publishing company, O Press; and also edited the anthology None of the Above: New Poets of the USA.


In 1982 Lally moved to Los Angeles to pursue opportunities in film and television as a writer and actor. He appeared in numerous movies, television episodes, and plays including Basic Instinct,  White Fang, Father Dowling Mysteries, and Deadwood. In addition to writing his own original screenplays and plays, Lally was a script doctor in which he contributed to existing screenplays. During his time in Los Angeles, Lally co-founded the Poetry in Motion series (1988â€“1996), which received media attention for its mix of Hollywood celebrities and poets. While living in California Lally also helped found and edit the original Venice magazine. 


Lally has published over 27 books of poetry and memoirs. His awards include the 92nd St. Y Poetry Center's Discovery Award for The South Orange Sonnets; numerous National Endowment for the Arts grants; and the 2000 American Book Award for It's Not Nostalgia. In 2006, Lally started the blog "Lally's Alley" (http://lallysalley.blogspot.com/) in which, as of 2019, he continues to write daily reflections on his personal life, movies, politics, and poetry. As of 2019, he is living and working in New Jersey.</field>
