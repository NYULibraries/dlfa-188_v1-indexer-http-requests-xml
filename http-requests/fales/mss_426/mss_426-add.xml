    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gay USA is a weekly news program dedicated to LGBT current events, history and issues facing the community both domestically and internationally. Founded in the early 1980's by gay activist and video producer Lou Maletta, who also founded the Gay Cable Network (GCN) in 1982. Hosted by Andy Humm since 1985, Ann Northrop joined as co-host in 1996. Created to counter the poor mainstream reporting on LGBT issues, specifically the AIDS epidemic, the program provides in depth analytical reporting and interviews rooted in LGBT activism and history. Gay USA covered both the Democratic and Republican Conventions from 1984 to 2000, as well as the demonstrations occurring across the country surrounding LGBT and AIDS issues. The show originally aired on GCN before moving to the Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN) in 2001, and is distributed nationally by Free Speech TV. It is also available online via Free Speech TV's youtube channel.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Andy Humm began his career in journalism in the 1970's and began hosting Gay USA in 1985. In addition to his work as co-anchor, he has hosted a variety of other programs, including Informed Sources (1991-1995), a weekly public affairs roundtable, Self-Help (1979-84), a weekly interview with leaders of mutual aid groups on WBAI-FM radio, segments of the Live Wire and Thirteen Live public affairs programs in 1991, and the national PBS special, Out in America. In print journalism, Humm has written for New York City News, Gay City News, the Village Voice, POZ and Next Magazines. Humm holds a Masters in Public Health and teaches at Hunter College's School of Urban Health where he was named a Distinguished Alumnus in 2001. He was also Director of Education at the Hetrick-Martin Institute for Lesbian and Gay Youth from 1986-95. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ann Northrop joined Gay USA in 1996, but has worked in television since the 1970's. She did work as a freelance production assistant, wrote criticism for a nationally syndicated column, as well as writing for Ms. Magazine and Ladies' Home Journal. In 1981, Northrop joined ABC's "Good Morning America" as a writer-producer and was then recruited by George Merlis to join him at CBS News as a producer. After five years with CBS, she left and accepted a job as an AIDS educator and educator on homosexuality at New York's Hetrick-Martin Institute for Lesbian and Gay Youth. Working as an AIDS educator reconnected her with her early activist roots with the anti-war effort in the 1960s and 70s as well as with the LGBT community in New York City. After four years at the Hetrick-Martin Institute, she left to pursue other activist and advocate work on behalf of LGBT issues. Her arrival at Gay USA was her return to television.</field>
