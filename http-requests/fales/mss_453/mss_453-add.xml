Materials include diaries, day planners, notebooks, zines, photographs, art originals, and cassette tapes, as well as artifacts and memorabilia. The collection also includes a metal lunchbox covered in stickers and containing handcuffs and a nightgown. Bands prominently featured in the collection include Sleater-Kinney, Nilla, Marmalade, Versus and Vitapup.</field>
