    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes correspondence, ephemera, and manuscripts of novels, plays, and short stories by Ursule Molinaro between 1963 and 1997. Molinaro's manuscripts focus on reimagining Greek myths to give the  female characters individual agency to escape the social strictures of their society. Ursule's writing material ranges from early research and handwritten notes to the final published books and plays. Her correspondence, from 1942 to 2000, are about translations and contracts related to publishing her writing and exhibiting her paintings. The collection also includes flyers, brochures promoting Ursule Molinaro's writing and painting from 1981 to 1994, and photographic prints, negatives, and slides. Audiovisual recordings of Molinaro reading her work as well as performances by contemporary artists she admired, like Arlo Guthrie and Ursula K. Le Guin,  are included in the Ursule Molinaro Papers.</field>
