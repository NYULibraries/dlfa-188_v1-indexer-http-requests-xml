    <field name="bioghist_teim">Nancy Topf (1942-1998) was a teacher, choreographer, and dancer active in New York in the 1960s-1990s. Her work was influential among post-modern dance communities and continues to be practiced by choreographers and movement educators certified in teaching her "Topf Technique," recognized by the International Somatic Movement Association. Topf's dances emphasized the connection between human skeletal and muscular anatomies, as well as ideokinesis (image-based movement). Along with her husband, composer Jon Gibson, Topf taught and performed widely from the 1970s to the 1990s. Her work was featured in several prominent dance and arts journals. Topf was killed in the Swissair Flight 111 flight over Nova Scotia in 1998.</field>
