    <field name="bioghist_teim">In March 1987, ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) was founded at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center to address the medical establishment and government's unresponsiveness to the AIDS pandemic. That month, they held their first protest and marched on Wall Street to combat the high price and unavailability of HIV treatments. Over the years, they successfully protested against pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, local and national politicians, the Food and Drug Administration, the Center for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, the Catholic Church, and other organizations to get acknowledgement of the crisis, better access to a diversity of treatments, and funding for AIDs education and drugs. The organization continues to be active as of this writing (2022) working to provide equitable access to HIV/AIDS healthcare and prevention.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">http://www.actupny.org/, http://www.actupny.com/, and http://actupny.com/actions/ were initially selected by Tamiment curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in circa 2008-2013 as part of the Other Left Activism Web Archive. In November 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2015, http://actupny.com/ and http://actupny.org/ were transferred to Fales Libary.</field>
