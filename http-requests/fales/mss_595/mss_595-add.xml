    <field name="abstract_teim">Stephen Facey is a trustee of Movement Research, The Chocolate Factory Theater, the St. Mark's Historic Landmark Fund, and the New York Preservation Archive Project. He served as the Parish Administrator of St. Mark's Church In-the-Bowery, where he managed the church's Arts Projects, comprised of Theatre Genesis, The Poetry Project, The Film Project, and Danspace. The Stephen Facey Collection on Theatre Genesis (dated 1964-2016) consists of materials collected by Facey documenting the history and activities of the off-off-Broadway theater Theatre Genesis. Materials in this collection include scripts, programs, flyers, reviews, and publications documenting the theater's 14 seasons (1964-1978), including works by playwrights Maria Irene Fornés, H.M. "Harry" Koutoukas, Walter Hadler, Leonard Melfi, Murray Mednick, and Sam Shepard. Many of the productions documented in this collection were directed by Ralph Cook. In addition to documenting Theatre Genesis' productions, the collection also documents the financial and business operations of a theatrical space, and the growth of the off-off-Broadway movement in New York City in the 20th century.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Stephen Facey Collection on Theatre Genesis, Inc. (dated 1964-2016) consists of materials collected by Facey documenting the history and activities of Theatre Genesis, one of the first off-off-Broadway theaters. Materials in this collection include scripts, programs, flyers, reviews, and publications documenting the theater's  14 seasons (1964-1978), including works by playwrights Maria Irene Fornés, H.M. "Harry" Koutoukas, Walter Hadler, Leonard Melfi, Murray Mednick, and Sam Shepard. Many of the productions documented in this collection were directed by Ralph Cook. The collection also contains a small amount of material Facey collected concerning the history and coverage of Theatre Genesis, as well as administrative documents for Re-Genesis, an effort to re-imagine the theatre in 1989. In addition to documenting Theatre Genesis' productions, the collection also documents the financial and business operations of a theatrical space, and the growth of the off-off-Broadway movement in New York City in the 20th century.</field>
