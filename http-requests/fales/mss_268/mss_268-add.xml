    <field name="bioghist_teim">Johnny Science (1955-2007) was a musician, make-up artist, and LGBT community leader. Science first began experimenting with theatrical make-up as a child in Englewood, New Jersey. From 1977-1980, he studied psychology at Fairleigh Dickensen University and specialized in gender and transsexuality. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Johnny adopted the surname Science while leading a band of the same name and art directing at New York nightclub Max's Kansas City in 1980. During this time, he became involved with the lesbian sadomasochism (SM) scene and began performing in leather. In the mid 1980s, Science started taking testosterone and identifying as a man. He also went by the names Johnny Armstrong, Daniel Austen, and John Grant at various times in his life.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1984, Science became a special effects make-up apprentice and began networking within the transgender community. In 1987, he was a facilitator and guest speaker at the International Foundation for Gender Education Annual Symposium in Massachusetts, provided "male make-over techniques," led a discussion on passing strategies, and began doing make-up for performance artist Diane Torr. In 1989, Science founded the F2M Fraternity and produced its newsletter Rites of Passage. In 1991, he founded The Drag King Club and began to coordinate "Drag-King-for-a-Day" workshops. He also collaborated with artist and sex educator Annie Sprinkle to produce, score, and perform in her film, Linda/Les and Annie: A Transexual Love Story. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Throughout the 1980s-1990s, Science appeared on the Howard Stern Show, the Phil Donohue Show, and the Joan Rivers Show, among others. In 1993, he began producing and hosting a weekly television show for the Manhattan Public Access Television Station called That Show with Johnny Science / The Drag King Club. In the late 1990s, Science was a member of the Gay Male SM Activists (GMSMA) and president of the Metro NY Chapter of the National Leather Association. He founded The Jovian Gentlemen, a social group that connected younger and elder men. Johnny Science passed away in 2007. </field>
