    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection consists of printed material produced by Come!Unity Press from 1972 to 1977. Pamphlets and posters addressing a variety of activism topics such as gay rights, women's rights, anti-facism, Native American rights, empowerment efforts for specific communities, and humanitarian crises in Vietnam, are represented in this assemblage of offset lithography prints. The pamphlets include poetry and appeals for social change on a broad and occasionally conflicting range of issues, including peace and anti-war efforts, gay rights and gay liberation, and international solidarity movements. Come!Unity Press was a gay anarchist collective that provided free printing materials and a shared living space for social and political activists. Operating from 13 East 17th Street in New York City, beginning in 1971, this 24-hour printing collective concentrated on publishing non-commercial alternative material on social and political justice issues. Come!Unity Press explained their purpose by printing slogans next to their logo stating "Survival by Sharing", "Unplug from Profit" and "Equal Access to the Poor, Printing Movement Alternatives to Imperialism, War and Rape."</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Come!Unity Press was a gay anarchist collective print shop that provided free printing materials and a shared living space for social and political activists. Operating from 13 East 17th Street in New York City, beginning in 1971, this 24-hour printing collective concentrated on publishing non-commercial alternative material on social and political justice issues. The free printing materials were provided through donations and appeals to the public were included on each paper item produced. Come!Unity Press explained their purpose by printing slogans next to their logo, such as "Survival by Sharing", "Unplug from Profit" and "Equal Access to the Poor, Printing Movement Alternatives to Imperialism, War and Rape". Appeals for donations were printed on the front of posters and brochures stating that the publication was free but that donations would cover the cost of printing. The Come!Unity Press collective promoted their views of gay rights and anarchy with graphic design that included rainbow motifs and marijuana leaves.</field>
