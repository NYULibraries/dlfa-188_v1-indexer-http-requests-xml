    <field name="bioghist_teim">Molly Neuman is a musician, writer, and chef who was active in the Riot Grrrl movement from its inception. The term "riot grrrl" was first coined in a zine co-written by Neuman and her friend Alison Wolfe while the two were studying at University of Oregon. Their collaboration on this zine--called "Girl Germs"--lead Neuman and Wolfe to form Bratmobile, a feminist, punk-influenced band, with Erin Smith. Both Neuman and Wolfe eventually transferred to Evergreen College in Olympia, Washington where they become more involved with the Riot Grrrl movement.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Bratmobile was primarily active from 1991-1994, releasing two albums on the record label Kill Rock Stars and releasing songs on various other compilations/split 7" records during that period. After the band disbanded, Neuman went on to be a part of several other bands including the Frumpies and the PeeChees, the latter of which featured her ex-husband Chris Appelgren. Bratmobile reunited briefly in 1999, eventually touring with the Donnas in 2001, whom Neuman was managing at the time. Bratmobile released two albums after reforming, 2000's "Ladies, Women and Girls" and 2002's "Girls Get Busy".</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Neuman was a partner with Appelgren at Lookout Records, a label which produced albums by acts including Green Day, Avail, and Pansy Division. In 2005, Lookout discontinued releasing new projects and Neuman began her own small label, Simple Social Graces Discos, releasing several records including the Delorean, the Two Tears and her own band, Love or Perish. In 2006, she joined the team at eMusic and continues to work there as Senior Director of Artist and Label relations.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 2009, she graduated from the Chef's Training Program at New Yorks Natural Gourmet Institute. Following graduation, Neuman opened Simple Social Kitchen, a personal chef, catering and culinary instruction company based in Brooklyn, NY.  She is currently working on a program aimed at creative people and health in the effort to connect all her passions. </field>
