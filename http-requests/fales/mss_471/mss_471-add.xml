    <field name="bioghist_teim">Performa is a New York City-based multidisciplinary non-profit arts organization dedicated to exploring the critical role of live performance in the history of twentieth century art and encouraging new directions in performance for the twenty-first century. 
Founded in 2004, Performa is the brainchild of art historian and curator RoseLee Goldberg, whose definitive book, Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present (1979 and 2000), pioneered the study of performance art. In 2001, Ms. Goldberg originated and produced visual artist Shirin Neshat's first live performance, Logic of the Birds, with critical and popular success in both New York and London. Evolved from this production, the idea came about to create the Performa biennial in 2005, called Performa 05, with a specially commissioned new performance at its core. The event offered a program of performances, exhibitions, symposia, and film screenings organized in collaboration with leading museums, galleries, alternative spaces, and independent curators in New York. It was a critical and popular success, setting a standard for the positioning of live performance in the international contemporary art world. Over 25,000 people attended events at more than twenty venues across the city during Performa 05's entire three-week run. 
Since that first year, the Performa biennial has presented new works by artists working in performance, first performance works by artists working in other mediums, and re-staging of seminal performance works from history. The Performa biennial has taken place every other year since then and has become a crucial component of Performa's mission.</field>
