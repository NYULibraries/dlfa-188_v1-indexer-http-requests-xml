    <field name="bioghist_teim">The American Institute for Verdi Studies (AIVS) is one of the world's top research centers for the study of the life and works of Giuseppe Verdi. The idea for the AIVS emerged out of increased interest in Verdi research following the Fourth International Congress of Verdi Studies in 1974. Planning for the Institute began in 1974, with performers, scholars, critics, librarians, and Verdi enthusiasts agreeing to serve as advisors to the new organization. Officially founded on April 1, 1976, the AIVS is open to public membership and is a division of the Music Department at New York University. The AIVS sponsors and promotes conferences, lectures, and performances, and publishes the only English-language journal dedicated to Verdi, the Verdi Forum. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Institute has organized three international conferences on Verdi studies, and in October 2013, the AIVS sponsored Verdi's Third Century: Italian Opera Today, a conference at NYU to celebrate the bicentennial of Verdi's birth and the legacy of his work. The AIVS Archive is located at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library at NYU.</field>
