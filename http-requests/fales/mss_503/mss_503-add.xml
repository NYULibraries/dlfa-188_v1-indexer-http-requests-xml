    <field name="abstract_teim">Visual AIDS is a New York City based contemporary arts organization committed to HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness, a mission which the organization accomplishes through a number of visual art projects, by supporting artists living with the disease, and by honoring and preserving the legacies of artists who have passed away from HIV/AIDS-related complications. The Visual AIDS Records not only document the daily administrative activities of the organization since its inception in 1988, but the archival collection also documents a few of the organization's key initiatives, including the Broadsides Project, the Red Ribbon Project, The Frank Moore Archive Project, a Day With(out) Art, Electric Blanket, and A Night Without Light. Materials include correspondence, meeting minutes, notes, proposals, financial documents, newsletters, awards, slides, photographs, audio-visual recordings, press kits, periodicals, clippings, fliers, calendars; tote bags, and t-shirts.  The collection also contains original design layouts by Group Material, materials that document artist Nan Goldin's contribution to Electric Blanket, and original prints and poster designs by artists like Barbara Kruger and Glenn Ligon.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Visual AIDS Records document the everyday administrative activities of the New York City based contemporary arts organization Visual AIDS, an organization founded in 1988 that, according to their official mission statement, "utilizes art to fight AIDS by provoking dialogue, supporting HIV+ artists, and preserving a legacy, because AIDS is not over." Additionally, the collection documents several of Visual AIDS' ongoing projects, including the Broadsides Project, the Red Ribbon Project, The Frank Moore Archive Project, a Day With(out) Art, Electric Blanket, and A Night Without Light. Materials include correspondence; meeting minutes; notes; proposals; invoices, receipts, and other financial documents; newsletters; awards; slides; photographs; audio-visual recordings; press kits; art-related periodicals; clippings; fliers; posters; oversize calendars; tote bags; and t-shirts.  The collection also contains original design layouts by Group Material, materials that document artist Nan Goldin's contribution to Electric Blanket, and original prints and poster designs by artists like Barbara Kruger and Glenn Ligon.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Visual AIDS is a New York City based contemporary arts organization committed to HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness, a mission which the organization accomplishes through a number of visual art projects, by supporting artists living with the disease, and by honoring and preserving the legacies of artists who have passed away from HIV/AIDS-related complications. Visual AIDS produces public, inclusive, and accessible art projects that encourage reflection, dialogue, new scholarship and action. In addition to their exhibitions, public events, and publications, the organization collaborates year-round with teachers and students to facilitate research and special projects that address the underlying and related issues that contribute to and exacerbate the HIV/AIDS pandemic, such as poverty, homophobia, and racism.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Not only do the Visual AIDS Records document the everyday internal activities of the organization, the archival collection also documents a few of the organization's primary initiatives. Each year the organization produces and distributes thousands of free, AIDS awareness, artist editions through their Broadsides Project. Within the collection, some materials also describe the Ribbon Project, which was created in 1991 by the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus, a group of artists who wanted to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and to acknowledge their caregivers. Additionally, the collection provides evidence of The Archive Project (later renamed The Frank Moore Archive Project in 2002), which was a project co-founded in 1994 by David Hirsch and Frank Moore who were concerned about losing a visual record of the artwork created by artists with HIV. Working with many living artists and estates, their efforts resulted in a slide archive that was used to teach others about AIDS art activism and the lasting importance of HIV+ visual artists. Since 2012, many of these slides have been digitized and re-launched online as The Visual AIDS Artist Registry. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Perhaps the most heavily documented project within the collection is a Day Without Art (later renamed a Day With(out) Art in 1998), which, since its inception in 1989, has encouraged numerous communities worldwide to remember those who have passed away from AIDS-related illnesses on the first of December, World AIDS Day, each year. A related project known as Electric Blanket began on December 1, 1990 and consists of a slide show that contains over two hundred photographs as well as slide texts detailing demographics, data, and slogans about AIDS worldwide. Similarly, A Night Without Light was also launched by Visual AIDS in 1990 to coincide with a Day Without Art, an initiative that calls for the lights on Manhattan's historic buildings, bridges, monuments and on Broadway's theatre marquees to be turned off for fifteen minutes, from 7:45 PM to 8:00 PM, as a visual reminder of the impact of AIDS. San Francisco has also dimmed its skyline in more recent years.</field>

In October 2022, crawling of the seeds were discontinued in NYC Arts Community COVID-19 Response Web Collection and crawling began in the Visual AIDS Web Collection. The website was captured through the use of Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. The accession numbers associated with these websites are 2022.051 and 2023.020. In November 2023, https://www.oralhistories.visualaids.org/ was added.
