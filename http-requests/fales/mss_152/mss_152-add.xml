    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Richard Foreman and Kate Manheim Papers document Richard Foreman's professional career as a playwright, director, and set designer, and Manheim's career as an artist. The collection reflects his creative process, the development of theatrical works as well as the production and reception of his plays. A small portion of the collection documents Richard Foreman's personal life, predominantly his childhood and family relationships. This collection also contains materials related to Kate Manheim's professional career, including but not limited to her work in Richard Foreman's plays and her work as an artist.  In addition, the collection represents some of Foreman's relationships with other artists including Stuart Sherman and Jonas Mekas among others. Although the collection materials span the years 1938 to 2011, the bulk of the material represents the years 1969-2004.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Richard Foreman was born in New York in 1937. He grew up in Scarsdale, New York. Throughout his youth, Foreman attended plays with his family and participated in theater productions as an actor and set designer. Although Foreman did some acting while in college at Brown University, his orientation shifted toward the creative control offered by playwriting. Foreman received his degree from Brown in 1959 and graduated from Yale Drama School with an MFA in playwriting in 1962.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Foreman founded the Ontological-Hysteric Theater in 1968. Performances initially took place at Jonas Mekas' Filmmakers Cinemateque located at 80 Wooster St. before the non-profit theater found its first home at 491 Broadway in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1980s the Ontological-Hysteric Theater uprooted itself, staging productions at several locations including La Mama, the Performing Garage, the New York Shakespeare Festival and the Theater for the New City. In 1992 the Ontological-Hysteric Theater settled at St Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. The non-profit organization has flourished in part due to grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. In the early 1980s the Ontological-Hysteric Theater expanded internationally, setting up a branch in Paris. The French government funds this branch.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Ontological Hysteric Theater provided a space for experimentation. Drawing upon underground film of the 1960s, Foreman developed a theatrical style devoted to "stripping the theater bare of everything but the singular and essential impulse to stage the static tension of interpersonal relations in space" (www.ontological.com). This approach emphasizes multiple levels of visceral experience, auditory and visual artistry, philosophy and psychoanalysis while minimizing the importance of plot conventions. Some of his most critically acclaimed work in this style includes "Rhoda in Potatoland (Her Fall-Starts)", "The Cure", "Film Is Evil: Radio Is Good" and "Eddie Goes to Poetry City." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Kate Manheim became a key figure in Foreman's work very early in the establishment of the Ontological Hysteric Theater. She first appeared in "Hotel China" in 1972. Though she did not play Rhoda in this production, she quickly became the iconic Rhoda. Manheim's creative daring as an actress enabled Foreman to push the limits of his theatrical approach. Manheim also influenced the content of Foreman's work, for example the "Film is Evil: Radio is Good" was especially shaped by Manheim's contributions.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Although Foreman is well known for his work as playwright and director of his own plays, he is also well regarded for collaborative work with other artists, theater direction as well as film and video projects. His collaboration with Stanley Silverman resulted in eight musical theater productions including "Elephant Steps" and "Dr Selavy's Magic Theater". He also directed new plays including Susan-Lori Parks' The Public Theater production of "Venus" and Kathy Acker's plays "Birth of the Poet" and "My Death, My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini". His directorial work also includes Bertolt Brecht's "The Threepenny Opera", Vaclav Havel's "The Golem", Moliere's "Don Juan", and Gertrude Stein's "Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights" among other productions. Additionally, Foreman developed film and video projects. These include the video work "City Archives", the film "Strong Medicine", and the television play "Total Rain".</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Finally, Foreman's creative endeavors include a substantial body of writing including a novel, No Body and numerous critical essays. Foreman's plays are collected in several anthologies including Plays and Manifestos (1976), Reverbertation Machines (1985), Unbalancing Acts (1992), My Head was a Sledgehammer (1995), and Paradise Hotel (2001). In addition, Foreman's work is the subject of numerous reviews, articles, dissertations and books by scholars and critical authors.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Foreman has staged his productions widely throughout the world. In the United States his work has been staged at venues including the Ontological Hysteric Theater, Lincoln Center, Yale Repertory Theater, Hartford Stage Company, the Other Stage, Performing Garage, La Mama, the Public Theater, Lennox MA Art Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Cinematheque and The New York Shakespeare Festival. Other art venues throughout the United States include the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, MN; New City Theater in Seattle, WA; the University of California, San Diego; and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, MN. Finally, Foreman's work enjoys a great deal of success internationally. His productions have been staged at Festival d'Atomne, Paris; Teatro di Roma, Italy; Wiener Festochen, Zurich and Vienna; Vienna Festival; Singapore Arts Festival; Theater das Welt Berlin; Montreal Festival; Meltdown Festival, London; Opera de Lille, Paris; Theater Aurora, Stockhom; and the Ro Theater, Rotterdam.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 2006 Foreman made a concerted break from his usual mode of theater and began "a series of performances dominated by projected tableaux vivants against which live actors appear and disappear" (Zomboid program notes). He continues these Film/Performance projects at the Ontological Hysteric Theater.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Ontological-Hysteric Theater promotes theater and performance geared toward "unsettling perception and disorienting understanding" (www.ontological.com). It achieves this mission through Richard Foreman's annual productions as well as cultivating the work of emerging artists. To this end, Richard Foreman makes his notebooks, the raw material of his plays, available for other artists to use as inspiration and source material for their own work. The Ontological Hysteric Theater also programs workshops and stages productions of emerging artists' work.</field>
