    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series XIII: Kate Manheim, contains materials related to Kate Manheim's professional career, including but not limited to her work in Richard Foreman's plays. Although materials connected to Kate Manheim appear throughout the collection, this series reflects the grouping of materials relating to Kate Manhiem in the collection's original organization. Subseries A: Prompt Scripts and Personal notes, includes Kate Manheim's prompt scripts as well as production notebooks containing personal notes as well as Richard Foreman's corrections and stage directions. This subseries is arranged alphabetically by play title and all of the contents involve Richard Foreman productions. Subseries B: Notes and Notebooks, includes notebooks that were not clearly designated as relating to a specific play. Additionally, these notebooks arrived grouped together in ziplock bags, separate from the script material. As a result, they remain in a subseries of their own. Subseries C: Production Materials, includes some press and memorabilia related to Foreman plays. Subseries D: Photographs, primarily documents Kate Manheim on stage.Subseries E: Other Projects, includes Kate Manheim's involvement in projects not directly related to Richard Foreman such as her own painting and her work with Heiner Muller. Subseries F: General Press and Interviews, contains articles about and interviews with Kate Manheim. Subseries G: General Theater Related Material, includes programs, publicity and other materials from theater productions and performance pieces by other artists. Materials are arranged chronologically by year. Undated materials appear at the end of the series arranged alphabetically by performer. Subseries H: Awards and Grants, includes awards Kate Manheim received as well as some grantwriting advice. &gt;Subseries I: Biographical Material, this very small series includes materials related to the lives of Kate Manheim and her family. Subseries J: Miscellaneous, contains materials that fell outside the scope of the previous subseries such as printed material, memorabilia, and notes.</field>
