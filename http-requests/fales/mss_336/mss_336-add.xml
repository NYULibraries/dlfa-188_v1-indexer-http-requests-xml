    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Greenwall Foundation was founded in 1949 by Frank and Anna Greenwall, in memory of their daughter, Susan, who had died of bone cancer at age 16. Their original mission was to provide grants and fellowships for students, and to help fund medical research on children's diseases. Throughout the years, the foundation grew and began supporting more diverse interests. In 1991, the Greenwall Foundation's Arts and Humanities Program was founded, with the mission to "Support emerging artists…, promote artistic experimentation…, enhance the international exposure of New York City artists…, and respond to opportunities provided by exceptional situations."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Arts and Humanities program was intended to support "innovation and creativity in the visual, performing and literary arts" and was "interested in encouraging emerging artists and the development of new artistic works".  This focus on emerging artists and new works set the Greenwall Foundation apart from more traditional funding agencies. In addition to the Foundation's one year grants, it also offered three year grants. These one-time multiyear awards were given to arts organizations, to expand and improve their administrative and structural foundations, allowing them to grow and addressing their needs in the long term. The foundation also offered the Oscar M. Ruebenhausen Commission, which endorsed and sponsored an artist who showed expertise in the annually changing discipline chosen by the foundation's board.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Greenwall Foundation concluded its arts and humanities program in 2011. During the twenty years that the Foundation was funding the arts, more than 1200 grants were given out to artists in various disciplines. The Foundation now solely focuses on the Greenwall Faculty Scholars Program in Bioethics.</field>
