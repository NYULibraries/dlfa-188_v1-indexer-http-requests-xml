    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Judson Memorial Church, located in Greenwich Village, is a place of worship that supports performing arts, social services, social justice, and participates in projects related to harm-reduction for IV drug users, reproductive justice, support for migrants, and other issues.  Their website details upcoming events and ongoing service projects, solicits donations, provides information about services like a gym and childcare program, sanctuary churches, and posts video sermons and photographs of church activities. The series also includes the original defunct Judson Memorial Church website, http://classic.judson.org/, as well a number of tumblr blog projects. Judson's Front Yard is a tumblr page that documents in images, text, and video the activism occurring in Washington Square Park (i.e. the "front yard" of Judson Memorial Church).  Judson Repro is a tumblr page created to document testimony by Judson Memorial Church members affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and belief in the right to reproductive autonomy. J2D 4U&amp; mi is a tumblr page that documents (in photos) handmade signs that are posted around the Judson Memorial Church.  These signs concern everything from outreach and activism at the church to youth holiday activities. Judson Windows is a tumblr page dedicated to the John La Farge designed stained glass windows within the Judson Memorial Church, with images and descriptions of each. The series also contains their newsletter, Judson's Digital Fountain.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Bring Jean Home was an action campaign organized by the Judson Memorial Church to reverse the deportation of Jean Montrevil, an immigration rights activist and Judson member, to Haiti and allow his to return to the United States. In October 2021, Montrevil was allowed to return to the United States due to a special interest parole. As of this writing (November 2021) the website also provides information on efforts to keep him in the United States.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Judson Memorial Church YouTube channel features videos containing sermons; highlights from Magic Time, Bailout Theater, and the GYM performances; choir performances; social justice lectures and events; protest footage; and other music and dance performances. In 2020, Judson shifted to online Sunday services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also include the Empathy Project, a website created by Judson Memorial Church to assist Christians with reproductive decisions, specifically support of abortion. The website contains a toolkit for congregations and clergy. The toolkit includes resources to promote discussions, reading groups, worship services, and counseling in order to help a church be better prepared to support women and families in making decisions about reproductive health, abortion and sexuality.</field>
