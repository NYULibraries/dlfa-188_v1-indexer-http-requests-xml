His compositions draw on the traditional music of Laos and Thailand as well as his interest in mathematics to form cross-cultural hybrid concert pieces. He is best known for his work with the khaen, a traditional instrument from southeast Asia. Soundcloud audio files were not captured due to technological constraints. Capture of site began in August 2016. This description is based on the June 2017 capture of the site.</field>
