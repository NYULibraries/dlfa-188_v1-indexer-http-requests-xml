    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection consists of a selection of websites produced and operated by contemporary
composers for the promotion of their work and careers. "Contemporary" we define as living or,
in a few cases, very recently deceased. "Composers" we define as creative musicians who are
working within, are descending from, or are in some significant way connected to the Western
traditions of concert music; this includes composers who produce notated scores plus those
whose work embraces improvisation, collaborative composition, and other post-modern/post-
classical creative practices. The curatorial emphasis is on young, emerging American composers.
Their sites typically include biographical data, calendars of performances, catalogs of scores and
recordings, and embedded audio and video. Capture of the sites began in 2014 and is ongoing.</field>
