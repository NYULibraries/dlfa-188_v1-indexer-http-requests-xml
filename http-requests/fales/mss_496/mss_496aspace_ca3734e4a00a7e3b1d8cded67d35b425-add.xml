    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This is a web art piece and professional website for composer and electronic musician Michelle Lou, structured as a web with interactive nodes, some of which link to external sites featuring several pieces of Lou's work and the artist's biography, performance listings, and others of which can be moved an manipulated. The videos linked to the website include performances of Lou's pieces "Different Furs," "In the Land of Milk and Honey," "Opal," and "Untitled Three Part Construction." Three of the nodes produce sine waves which can be played in combination to produce harmony or dissonance.  This website was first captured in April of 2014, but has only existed in its current form since 2016.  Prior to 2016, the URL was associated with a more conventional professional site for Michelle Lou featuring a biography, a selection of audio tracks, an events calendar of upcoming performances, and a now-defunct 'Random' section.  This description is based on the November 2019 crawl of the site.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Crawl was limited to domains and subdomains of http://www.michellelou.com/ order to remain within the collection scope and data constraints.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Youtube, Vimeo, Instagram, and Soundcloud pages were also captured due to their contextual value to the site that is the focus of this crawl.</field>
