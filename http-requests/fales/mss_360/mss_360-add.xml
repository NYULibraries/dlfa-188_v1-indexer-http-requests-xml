    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of materials collected and produced in conjunction with Ladyfest 2000 in Olympia, Washington. The photographic materials were solicited from participants by Ladyfest organizer Tina Herschelman. Organizer Kanako Wynkoop gathered the material together, and organizer Beth Stinson added her own contributions from her time as an organizer and donated the collection to Fales.The collection is divided into four series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: Photographic Materials</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of photographs sent to Ladyfest organizers. Some of the photos are of artwork and goods that artists hoped to display or sell at Ladyfest, and the vast majority of the photos are candid shots taken at the events of Ladyfest 2000. Photographs, negatives, contact sheets, and slides document musical and artistic performances, as well as more casual moments of the festival. The archivist labeled the files with the name of the person who sent the materials, if known.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Beth Stinson Materials</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These materials include ephemera, paste-ups, and mock-ups of festival booklets and ephemera generated in conjunction with Ladyfest that Beth Stinson, one of the organizers of the festival, collected. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III: Media</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of digital video and audio tapes documenting the planning process and the performances at Ladyfest 2000. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV: Data Storage</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of two unlabeled zip disks. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ladyfest 2000 was a non-profit, community-based event organized by and for women to showcase, celebrate and encourage the artistic, organizational and political work and talents of women. Taking place in Olympia, Washington from August 1 to August 6, 2000, Ladyfest featured performances by bands, spoken word artists, and writers, as well as workshops, panels, art shows and dance parties. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The inspiration for Ladyfest arose in part when some former members of the feminist Riot Grrrl movement were interviewed for Seattle's Experience Music Riot Grrrl Retrospective oral history project in 1999. Looking back at their participation in Riot Grrrl, and in light of the sexual assaults that had happened at the 1999 Woodstock festival, they were motivated to create a festival that created a safe and inspirational space for women's performance and activism.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ladyfest was organized and run entirely by volunteers. Initial meetings began in fall 1999. By the third meeting in January 2000, around 35 prospective organizers attended, and committees on Budget, Volunteer coordinating, Booking, Merchandise, Workshops, Visual Art, Performance, Documentation and Web Site Creation had been formed. The festival drew over 2,000 attendees, and included performances by Bratmobile, Sleater-Kinney, The Gossip and Cat Power. Workshops were given on auto mechanics, letterpress, gardening, and dismantling racism. Other events included a fashion show, a drag show, art openings, and a sewing circle. Ladyfest was a woman-run event, but all were welcome to attend. Events listed as "ladies only" were open to all women, including women who identified as men, and ladies who were born male. 
 
Since 2000, over 100 Ladyfest festivals inspired by Ladyfest 2000 have taken place worldwide, including in Australia, France, Indonesia, South Africa, and Switzerland. The meeting minutes have been archived at the Ladyfest website (http://www.ladyfest.org/planning/index.html#1230).</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">This collection was donated to the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections by Elizabeth Stinson in 2012 and 2013. Most of the collection consists of materials mailed by festival attendees to festival organizer Tina Herschelman after the festival was over. These materials were stored by festival organizer Kanako Wynkoop at her clothing store Dumpster Values in Olympia until they were brought to New York by festival organizer Elizabeth Stinson and donated to NYU's Fales Library &amp; Special Collections. Other materials were donated by Stinson from her own organizational files in 2013.</field>
