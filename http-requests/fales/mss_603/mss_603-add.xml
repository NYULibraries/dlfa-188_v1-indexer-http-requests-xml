    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The New York City Arts Community COVID-19 Response Web Collection documents art galleries and art organizations use of their online presenece to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and by extension the Black Lives Matter movement. The collection consists of digital art exhibits that highlight existing work that relates to COVID-19 pandemic, especially art created during the AIDS epidemic. Other online art exhibits (and later in-person exhibits) highlight and commission new work, with focuses on themes such as mutual aid, community care, social distancing, the activity of creation during the pandemic, uncertainty, climate change, government aid (and lack thereof), mental health, the pandemic outside of New York, death, healing, and Black and transgender lives. The websites also focus on the organizations' shifts to virtual events, including  reading series, book clubs, fundraisers, awards, and video programs. In addition, the websites also provide resources for artists related to mental and physical health, grants and fellowships, professional development tools to find jobs and present work online. This is an artificial collection, materials were selected by Fales curators and arranged by an archivist.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In March 2020, non-essential businesses throughout New York City closed in an effort to contain COVID-19, a respiratory virus that first identified in December 2019. These closures led to the temporary closing of art galleries and other art organizations in New York City. The organizations shifted to virtual activities, including online art exhibits and event series, digital fundraisng campaigns, and resources for artists. Many online resources focused on providing support to members of the arts community, who often were out of work during the pandemic. During the pandemic, George Floyd, a black man, was killed by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, in May 2020. This led to protests calling for the abolishment of the police and a resurgence in the Black Lives Matter movement. In late 2020 to early 2021, galleries and art organizations began slowly reopening to the public with health and safety measures in place. As the pandemic continued into 2021 and 2022, art organizations develop art commissions related to experiences surrounding the pandemic. In late 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were required to enter the arts organizations. As of this writing in May 2022, the pandemic is still an active part of life.</field>
