    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Performance Space New York, founded as Performance Space 122 in 1980, is an organization that presents and commissions artists whose work challenges boundaries of live performance. The website contains series information dating back to 2018. In 2020, created a digital exhibit and project called "02020" with mental health resources, surveys, and Open Movement live stream content, as well as paid a cohort of artists to reenvision Performance Space to service the needs of artists during the pandemic and racial justice reckoning. Later in 2020, they held a fundraiser for Black and transgender Artists-in-Residents that were invited to work with Performance Space during the Black Lives Matter protests in June 2020. In Spring 2021, the organization began reopening to the public and the website contained COVID safety guidelines and exhibitions, outdoor performances, and digital events from the Knowledge of Wounds series. In Fall 2021, the organization required proof of vaccination, established the communal Open Room, and reestablished its Octopus series and Open Movement workshops. In late 2021, the organization rewrote its mission statement and publicized it using a pop-up graphic on the website. In 2022, they reestablished First Mondays: Readings of New Works in Progress series and started the We the Youth lecture series. The website also contains information on upcoming performances, installations, readings, awards, and galas.</field>
