    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains material related to José Muñoz's professional career as a professor  and scholarly writer, specifically on queer politics and aesthetics. Muñoz taught college courses during the early to mid-2000s within the Department of Performance Studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. This series contains paper and digital files with course syllabi, course descriptions and announcements, copies of required readings, and departmental correspondence. Muñoz's course material not only represents a sampling of the topics taught at NYU, but also dovetails with themes he wrote about in his essays, articles, books, and presentations. His themes included Latin America and queer sexualities; the overall idea of queerness; and queer artists of color and their positionality in the performance art world. Muñoz also wrote on individual performers and artists including Vaginal Davis, Nao Bustamonte, Bola de Nieve, Andy Warhol, and the band The Gun Club. His writings are documented in this series through drafts, edited proofs, and copies of published articles. This series also contains a selection of Muñoz's source material in paper, digital, and audiovisual formats used to support his scholarly works. Files include exhibition catalogs; event programs; and articles written by others, as well as analog and digital audiovisual recordings of performance art and drag performances. Source material in this series also includes small independent publications from the 1990s, mostly focusing on queer lifestyle and culture. Titles include Pansy Beat, Old, My Comrade, A La Brava, and Perra! Muñoz's involvement as a member of a performance group named Coco Frio during the 2000s includes audio and video performance recordings, scripts, and notes. His engagement with professional conferences and lectures, either as a coordinator and/or speaker is documented in this series through event programs, notes, script drafts, and correspondence.</field>
