    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The José Muñoz Papers (1970s-2014) contain materials related to the personal life and career of José Esteban Muñoz, a scholar and writer in the field of queer politics and aesthetics, as well as a professor and chair for the Department of Performance Studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. The collection contains digital and paper files documenting performance studies and queer theory as academic disciplines through Muñoz's NYU course material dating from the 2000s to mid-2010s. This collection not only illustrates relevant topics taught at a university during the 2000s, but also the scholarly works produced during this time through his drafts, proofs, and published articles. His writings discuss topics including queer performance artists of color and the role their art plays within their lives and community. Related academic conference and lecture programs and scripts are also in this collection. A large number of personal photographs within this collection, the majority of which are digital, illustrate the life of a young academic and professor living and working in New York. Photographic subjects include travel, friends, his dogs, arts events, parties, and selfies and portraits of Muñoz, taken during the late 1990s-2010s. Ephemera from his studies at Duke University in the 1990s include class papers and assigned readings, as well as event posters and fliers from film and performance events he was involved with as a student.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">José Esteban Muñoz (1967-2013) was a Cuban American academic in the fields of performance studies, visual culture, queer theory, cultural studies, and critical theory. He received both his undergraduate degree from Sarah Lawrence College (1989) and his doctorate from Duke University (1994) in comparative literature.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Muñoz was a professor and chair of the Department of Performance Studies at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and wrote extensively on visual art and aesthetics. He was also the editor of the journals Social Text and Women and Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Muñoz's writing focused on the role of race within gay and lesbian studies as expressed in his first book Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics (1999). A decade later, his second book Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity (2009) was published.</field>
