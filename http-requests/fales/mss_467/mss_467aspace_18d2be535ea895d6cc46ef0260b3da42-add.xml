    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains material related to Burkhart's work as a multidisciplinary artist using techniques including painting, collage, drawing, art installations, photography, and filmmaking. Specific artworks and projects with a significant amount of material in this series include the The Abortion Project, Torture Paintings, Nudes, Numbers &amp; Letters, and Still Life Series/Hard Core. Paper and electronic files contain sale invoices; loan agreements; exhibition installation images; artwork images; and exhibition promotional and planning files. Files related to Burkhart's Liz Taylor Series artworks are arranged into Series II, although Taylor Series material may be found throughout Series I, if it was listed or shown with other Burkhart artworks.


Burkhart's creative process as it relates to her video projects is illustrated through both her paper and electronic file notes, project descriptions, and film stills, as well as video and sound recordings on various formats. Video projects with significant documentation in this series include  Spendthrift, 1001 Coffee Shops, Nicole, Shave, American Woman, and Fugue. This series also contains a video recording, reviews, film stills, screening invitation, and project descriptions for "Performance, May May 26, 1995 Pascara, Italy," an art performance piece and the wedding ceremony for Burkhart and Jozef van Wissem. This project also included limited edition handcuffs which were produced to accompany this video piece, and this series contains handcuff descriptions, images, and documentation. Her correspondence files contain communications with gallery owners, fellow artists, exhibition curators, and art collectors.


Funding files in this series contain correspondence, status and final reports, as well as application packets which often include project descriptions, artwork images, artist statements, and resumes. This type of funding opportunities made it possible for Burkhart to support herself as a writer and artist.


From the 1980s to 2017, Burkhart lived part of the year in a live/work space in Brooklyn. This series contains the accumulation of files related to Burkart and other resident artists' decades-long conflict with her Brooklyn aprtment/studio building owners, due to poor maintenance of the building. Her documentation of unsafe living conditions and subsequent legal actions were collected in the form of correspondence photographs, and public court documents. This series also contains ad postings, correspondence, sublet agreements, conflict documentation, and apartment use instruction lists related to Burkhart subletting her apartment to various artists while living in Holland for a portion of the year.</field>
