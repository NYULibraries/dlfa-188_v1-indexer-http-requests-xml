    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Grace Knipe Papers were accumulated by her niece Kathe Burkhart and include Knipe's personal correspondence, diaries, notebooks, writings, and childhood ephemera, dating from the early 1900s to the 1990s. There is a small amount of early childhood ephemera including early 1900s school notes, as well as early poems and stories written sporadically from 1914 to 1977. Knipe's personal diaries date from 1929 to 1948 and are entered mostly in mini monthly journal books which typically contain daily appointments, family activities, work, national news, and the weather. This series also includes books and notes kept while Knipe participated in a Christian women's group through her church. This series contains a photograph of Knipe at 100 years old and obituaries for her husband William in 1959, and herself in 1996. There is also correspondence from neice Kathe Burkhart and also Knipe's sister dating from the 1970s to the 1980s. Burkhart wrote a book, Between the Lines (published in 2006), which was inspired by letters found after her aunt's death that were from Kate Gibson during the 1920s and 1930s. They appeared to have a close friendship and the letters often included family and friend news as well as events in their daily lives, while Grace worked outside the home in an office, and Kate lived in her family home and dealt with chronic illness.</field>
