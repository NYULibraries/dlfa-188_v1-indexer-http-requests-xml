    <field name="abstract_teim">Kathe Burkhart (1958- ) is an American artist, writer, professor, and graphic designer based in both New York and The Netherlands. Her artwork utilizes various techniques including collage, painting, digital media, photography, video recordings, and sculpture. These techniques manifest in multiple forms including installations, short films, and writings. Her visual works frequently engage with themes such as gender roles, sexual politics, female dominance, and celebrity. The Kathe Burkhart Papers consist of paper and electronic files, and audio and video recordings on multiple formats which have been created and collected by Kathe Burkhart over the course of her personal and professional life dating from the 1960s to 2017. These materials document Burkhart's interdisciplinary work and provide contextual understanding of her artistic processes. Files and audiovisual material accumulated by Burkhart document her career as an artist through press clippings, artwork images, press releases, grant proposals, exhibition promotional material, and business correspondence. Datebooks and notebooks from the 1970s to the mid-2010s function as a combination of journals and appointment books. A significant amount of documentation is related to Burkhart's ongoing project, the The Liz Taylor Series, which originated in 1982, and includes source material, artwork images, clippings, and exhibition ephemera. 
Work files related to her writings include drafts, contracts, correspondence, and cover layouts, documenting her books From Under the 8-Ball (1985), The Double Standard (2002, 2005), Between the Lines (2006), and Dudes (2014). Burkhart's poetry, short stories, and articles are also in this collection. Files related to Burkhart's graphic design work and classes she taught at New York University and other institutions are also in this collection. Correspondence, writings, ephemera, and diaries related to Burkhart's Aunt Grace Knipe are in this collection and used as inspiration for her book Between the Lines (2006). Burkhart's personal files include photographs, astrology readings, correspondence, and high school and college ephemera.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Kathe Burkhart Papers consist of materials created and collected by Kathe Burkhart in the course of her personal life and professional work as an interdisciplinary artist, writer, graphic designer and professor. Paper and electronic files in this collection contain original documentation which provides contextual understanding of Burkhart's artistic process dating from the 1960s to the mid-2010s.

Source material on the actress Elizabeth Taylor was accumulated over decades by Burkhart and dates from the 1960s to the mid-2010s. Burkhart began creating this series of works in the 1980s and continues as of 2021.


Labels, project descriptions, digital sound files, notes, final versions, and edited and unedited video clips related to her video projects are in this collection including  Spendthrift, 1001 Coffee Shops, Nicole, Shave, American Woman, and Fugue. Burkhart's collection of studio diaries, notebooks, journals, appointment books, and desk calendars document her personal relationships; artwork ideas and writings; and daily activities while living and working in both New York and Amsterdam from the 1980s to the 2010s. Because of the private nature of these journals, they are not presently available to researchers.


Burkhart's poetry, short stories, novels, and critical review work files include drafts, page design layouts, correspondence, and audio and video recordings of readings and spoken word performances. This collection also includes a selection of work samples and client files related to Burkhart's graphic design work. Burkhart has been a professor at New York University and other educational institutions, teaching courses in art and art theory including the courses  Drawing I and II;  Sex and Contemporary Visual Art; Art and Activism; and Introduction to Critical Theory. Teaching files typically include course descriptions, syllabi, reading lists, notes, and correspondence.


Material related to Burkhart's personal life includes magazine profile interviews; astrology charts and readings; photographs of Burkhart, friends, and pets; correspondence with family and friends; and ephemera from Burkhart's high school and college years dating from the 1970s and 1980s in West Virginia and California. Burkhart also collected material related to her aunt, Grace Knipe, including ephemera, letters, diaries, writings, and notebooks, which illustrate the life of a woman working and living in West Virginia during the 1920s to the 1950s. Burkhart used letters to Knipe from her friend, Kate Gibson, as inspiration for her 2006 novel Between the Lines.


Correspondence as well as artwork and personal images will overlap throughout all the series, because Burkhart's personal and professional lives are so interwoven.</field>
