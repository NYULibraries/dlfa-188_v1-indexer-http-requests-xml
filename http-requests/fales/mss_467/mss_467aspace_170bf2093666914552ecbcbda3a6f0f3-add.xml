    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burkhart has worked as a graphic designer for clients including American Express, Coach, and Dutch East India Trading / Homestead Records. This series includes source image material, client work files, correspondence, and work samples. Work files can contain project sample boards, print layout sheets, and her design-related resume and business cards. Burkhart also designed cover art for some of her ex-husband Jozef van Wissem's music albums, of which there are proofs and CDs represented in this series. Her promotional fliers, advertisements, and album cover artwork for the Dutch East India Trading and Homestead Records during the 1980s are also in this series. Various other completed client samples in this series include advertisements, brochures, and magazine layout pages, which illustrate the breadth of her clientele, from jewelry companies to recording studios. She also worked on a number of book cover designs, including Country Herbs and American Country Living: The Ultimate Lifestyle Compendium. Copies of those books are in this series to fully represent her work, along with layout boards. There are also cover design work samples for Burkhart's own novel,  From Under the 8-Ball, published in 1985.</field>
