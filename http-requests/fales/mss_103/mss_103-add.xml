    <field name="abstract_teim">Harold Hart Crane was born in 1899 and became a significant voice within modernist American poetry of the first half of the twentieth century. Crane moved to New York City and mixed with other prominent writers of the time and was influenced by both contemporary currents in poetry, and his early affinity for nineteenth-century French poets. In 1930, Crane received some acclaim from the publication of "The Bridge," his book-length poem that depicts New York City and his outlook on America in general.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Papers consist of letters, postcards, photographs, drawings, tearsheets, and clippings about Crane. Most of the items are typed letters signed by Crane to Charlotte and/or Richard Rychtarik. (Richard Rychtarik was an American set and costume designer of major productions at the Metropolitan Opera and other companies.) There are two letters from Waldo Frank to Crane, a handful of letters from Grace Hart Crane, and correspondence with Philip Horton. Among the photos are images of Crane in Brooklyn with the Bridge in the background, images of his rooms, of his visit to Woodstock, NY, and signed portraits, including one signed portrait by Walker Evans.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Harold Hart Crane (1899-1932) was born in Garrettsville, Ohio and became a significant voice within modernist American poetry of the first half of the twentieth century. Though without a college education and dissuaded from a career in poetry, Crane moved to New York City to write, where he met other prominent writers of the time, such as E. E. Cummings, Jean Toomer and Katherine Anne Porter. He was influenced by both the contemporary currents in poetry, such as T.S. Eliot, and his early affinity for nineteenth-century French poets, like Arthur Rimbaud. Most of his published material was written between 1924 and 1926. Crane's work was impacted by his difficulties with alcohol use and the homophobia he experienced. In 1930, he received acclaim and distinction from the publication of "The Bridge," his book-length poem that depicts New York City and his outlook on America in general. Crane had struggled to complete "The Bridge," and when he found himself particularly at a loss, he sought inspiration by traveling to an island near Cuba and Europe. Crane temporarily settled in Mexico from 1931 to 1932 on a Guggenheim Fellowship.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The Richard W. Rychtarik Hart Crane Papers were the gift of the Richard W. Rychtarik Estate by Mrs. Gertrude Rychtarik. The papers were donated in September, 2000. The collection consists of letters, postcards and photographs, as well as some supplemental materials, that were kept by Mr. Rychtarik, a close personal friend of Crane.</field>
