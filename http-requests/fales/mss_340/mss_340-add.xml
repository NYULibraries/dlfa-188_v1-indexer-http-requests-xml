    <field name="bioghist_teim">Darinka: A Performance Studio was opened on April 21, 1984 by Gary Ray Bugarčić (aka Gary Ray). The club served as a venue for artists of all disciplines, including performance, theatre, music, dance, film, video, fine art, and poetry and prose. In keeping with the Eastern European roots of the East Village/Lower East Side, the club was named after Gary's mother, who was Croatian born. Darinka is a derivative of the Slavic word dar, meaning "gift."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The club was located at 118 East First Street, two doors down from Avenue A, and had a speakeasy type entrance under the residential stoop of the building. Up to the late 1970s, the space was used as a local Italian Social Club until a fire destroyed it. During the renovation of the space, all the old charred beams were laid in the backyard to provide an urban rustic wood patio enjoyed by patrons during the hot summer months. The interior of the club had a small proscenium stage that was described by many as looking like a live television. A variety of local painters such as James Romberger and Mark Kostabi showed their work on the walls of the club until the permanent murals and stencils were painted. Regular performers included They Might Be Giants (considered the house band), performance artist Steve Buscemi (still a fireman when he started performing), Karen Finley, Jack Smith, Charles Long, William Pope L., Kembra Pfahler, Nick Zedd, Anna Deavere Smith, and John S. Hall.  In addition, there were many writers who read during the Sunday prose and poetry nights, including Darius James, Patrick McGrath, Hal Sirowitz, Lynne Tillman, Mark Dery, Nina Zivancevic, Peter Cherches, Bob Holman, Ira Cohen and Taylor Meade. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On June 29, 1985, the NYPD raided the club during a mushroom party and performance by artists David West and Andy Somma. Gary Ray and the bartender, Robin Clements, were arrested for operating an unlicensed bottle club. Several months later Darinka reopened as a private club with Randy Lee Hartwig and John Gernand as managers. As a private club each new member would fill out a membership application card upon entrance. The application cards were kept in a file near the door in case of police inquiry. Membership cards were also distributed.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Darinka was the first home of "The Church of the Little Green Man." The church was founded by conceptual artist Mike Osterhout and had its first service in December of 1986. Darinka closed in May of 1987. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Articles mentioning Darinka have appeared in The Village Voice, New York magazine, High Performance, East Village Eye, Toronto Globe and Mail, The New York Times, and The Drama Review (Spring 1985). The club is also acknowledged in the documentary Gigantic: A Tale Of Two Johns.</field>

Gary Ray Bugarčić, a graduate of The American Academy of Dramatic Arts and SUNY Empire State College, has worked as an actor and stage director in almost every downtown New York theatrical venue and helped develop the off-broadway rock musical Bulldozer: The Ballad of Robert Moses. As a musician, he played in several bands, including State of Desire and The Academy, which performed regularly at CBGB and Danceteria before opening Darinka. After closing the club he toured with Karen Finley in her play The Theory of Total Blame and worked with The Ridiculous Theatrical Company, The Ridge Theatre Company, as well as with Kestutis Nakas and in Jeff Weiss's "Hot Keys." He has also appeared in such indie films as Todd Haynes' Poison and Desperately Seeking Susan. New Blood magazine published his poetry in the 1980s and his photography, including his 3-D lenticular prints, have been exhibited in New York City at The American Academy of Arts and Letters, The Participant Gallery, Max Fish, and 201@105.</field>
