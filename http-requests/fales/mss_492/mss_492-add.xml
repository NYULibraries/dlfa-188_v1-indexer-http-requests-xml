    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of materials accumulated by member and organizer Atif Toor, documenting SALGA-NYC history and organizational activities, as well as the South Asian immigrant LGBTQ community in New York City more broadly. This collection also contains event announcements and fliers, including the annual "Color Me Queer" dance party and the PARDA: Unveiling South Asian Artistic Queer Expression event. Clippings cover SALGA-sponsored events, as well as national and international LGBTQ community issues impacting members. Photographs depict members participating in various pride and international parades, dances, and retreats. A SALGA-NYC historical timeline, general information fliers, meeting information and attendee lists, and event planning notes can be found in this collection. Informational postcards and original photographs for SLAAP! (Sexually Liberated Arts Activist Asian People!) are also included in this collection. 
These materials document the experiences of this small, international community of New Yorkers, from the early 1990s to the early 2000s with regards to the intersection of gender, sexuality, and diasporic backgrounds.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">SALGA-NYC, formerly known as the South Asian Lesbian and Gay Association, is a not-for-profit, all-volunteer organization serving the South Asian LGBTQ community in the New York area. The organization was founded in 1991 for gay men to debate about co-gender and inclusion of other races in meetings. The organization eventually expanded its mission, promoting awareness, acceptance, empowerment, and safe inclusive spaces for people of all sexual and gender identities who trace their heritage to South Asia or who identify as South Asian. Groups march in Manhattan and Queens gay pride parades as well as the India Day and Pakistan Day parades, supporting SALGA-NYC's mission to enable community members to establish cultural visibility, and oppose oppression and all forms of discrimination. SALGA-NYC also provides multi-generational support, immigration advocacy, and assistance with mental and physical health issues through monthly support meetings and retreats, as well as sponsoring events such as the annual "Color Me Queer" dance party, film festivals, and workshops.</field>
