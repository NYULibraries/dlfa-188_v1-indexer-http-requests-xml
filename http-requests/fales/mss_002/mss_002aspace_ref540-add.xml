    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Subseries B consists of the papers of Charles Ephraim Robins (1832-1893), and makes up the bulk of Series III. CER was an entrepreneur, a scientist, and politico-religionist. He also wrote and lectured on social issues such as prohibition. CER's papers include extensive business correspondence, which documents his ventures in real estate, insurance, banking, manufacturing, and assaying. In 1875, CER went to the territory of Colorado as an assayer for the Little Annie Gold Mining Company. His office was located at Summit in Rio Grande County, from which he also observed and reported on weather conditions for the United States Army. In 1880 Robins visited him at Summit, just as she would later visit her brothers on the gold fields of Alaska in 1900. CER wrote to his family about the West, religion, God, women's rights, landscapes, the family, and events of the day.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries B also contains consistent runs of indexed letterpress books (outgoing) and letterbooks (incoming), in addition to 25 volumes of CER's personal diary. </field>
