    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Subseries A contains letters from childhood friends, relatives, family friends, actors, actresses and admirers. There are also letters from Dr. Andrew McLaughlin of the Oak Lawn Retreat for the Insane in Jacksonville, Illinois where Robins's mother, Hannah Crow Robins, was committed for several years. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Robins and her husband, George Richmond Parks, traveled separately in their work, and many letters from Parks to Robins survive. The letters begin during their courtship in 1884 and end with Parks's suicide note in 1887. Folder 47 contains Parks's record book in which he recorded his theatrical engagements (date, place, play, part) for the years 1877-1886. Folder 44 includes newspaper clippings about his suicide.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Elizabeth Robins moved to England in May of 1888 and created an entirely new life for herself. She continued to correspond with her family but lost contact with most of her friends and acquaintances from her early years. The letters of the few American friends and relatives who continued to write after 1887, including Lloyd Tevis, president of Wells Fargo and a maternal cousin of Robins's, who sponsored her early acting career, can be found in Subseries B. Some letters to and from childhood friends can be found in two letterbooks, which date from 1878-1881. The majority of these refer to Robins's four-month stay in the Rocky Mountains during her eighteenth summer. [See also Series Three: Robins Family Papers.] </field>
