    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hugh Auchincloss Steers (1962-1995) was an American painter whose artwork has been described as a combination of dreamlike allegory and figurative realism. Steers was born in Washington, D.C. and studied at Yale University, the Parsons School of Art and Design, and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. Steers' artistic practice was inspired by notable figures in art history, such as El Greco, Pierre Bonnard, Edgar Degas as well as American artists like Edward Hopper, Jackson Pollock, and Franz Kline whom he believed created artwork that embodies a "gorgeous bleakness" and a "soft glow of brutality." Unlike his contemporaries, Steers committed to representational painting and figuration throughout his career, depicting - through a dramatic and colorful palette - a skewed use of perspective, a skillful depiction of light, and intimate, ambiguous scenes of isolated figures or couples that speak to issues of identify politics, mortality, eroticism, frailty, isolation, defiance, and compassion. Soon after Steers was diagnosed with HIV in 1987, he increasingly focused on AIDS as a subject matter, in particular the impact of queer identity and the AIDS crisis. During the last five years of his life, he introduced a fictive alter ego, a slender figure consistently cloaked in a white hospital gown. Steers passed away of AIDS-related complications in 1995 at the age of 32.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Steers received a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Fellowship grant in 1989, and his work has been exhibited at a number of galleries and museums across the United States and Italy, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the Denver Art Museum, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, and the Drawing Center in New York City. Steers' work can be found within the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Walker Art Center, and the Denver Art Museum, and a comprehensive monograph of his work was published by Visual AIDS in 2015.</field>
