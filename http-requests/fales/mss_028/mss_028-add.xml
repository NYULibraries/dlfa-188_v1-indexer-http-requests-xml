    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Levy Dime Novel Collection contains a wide range of novels, periodicals, and serials dating from as early as 1780 through 1968. The bulk of the material dates from the 1880's and 90's. One of the areas of focus is on what Levy called "feminine" fiction: works composed by, about, and/or for women. Complete sets of The Merriwell Library by Burt L. Standish, The Pirate Story Series, and The Deadwood Dick Library by Edward L. Wheeler are included in the collection. Among the authors well represented are Miss. M. E. Braddon, Charlotte M. Brame/Bertha M. Clay, Nicholas Carter, The Duchess, Charles Garvice, Mrs. Mary J. Holmes, Old Sleuth, and Mrs. Emma D. E. N. Southworth.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Edward G. Levy was born in New Haven, Connecticut on October 21, 1898. In 1939, he began seriously collecting 19th Century literary materials. During this time, he co-founded the Charlton Publishing Corporation, which he later sold in order to catalogue his 150,000 books, manuscripts, and memorabilia. Levy established collections with these materials at over a dozen institutions, including the Fales Library, where he built a significant collection through multiple donations. The New York Public Library, the Beinecke Library at Yale, and the Rappaporte Library at Brandeis also received substantial gifts from Mr. Levy.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Edward G. Levy made his first deposit of materials to the Fales Library in December 1964 with the idea of establishing a representative collection of nineteenth-century popular fiction at NYU. Larger shipments followed between May of 1965 and August of 1967. In November of 1969 Mr. Levy formally donated all previous deposits to the Fales Library. He also presented additional items at this time to bring the total number of items up to 8,427. Further gifts arrived in August 1973, November 1974, and September 1975 adding approximately 8,400 items for a total of nearly 17,000 items.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim"> Itemized checklists exist for most of the gifts received by the library, some prepared by Mr. Levy prior to shipment and some by the Fales staff upon receipt. An unknown number of items were integrated into the Fales American and British collections and some items were sent to the circulating collection but no documentation of these transfers exists.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim"> In the mid-1990s the Levy materials were packed into archival folders and boxes for storage and a box-level checklist was created. In 2003-2004 this item-level finding aid was created without further physical reorganization of the materials. </field>
