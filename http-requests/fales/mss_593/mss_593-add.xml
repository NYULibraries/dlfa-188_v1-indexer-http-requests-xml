    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Dixon Place website features information about upcoming events, the theater board, the theater's restaurant and lounge, membership, and space rental. Events are broken down into categories, such as theater, in the lounge, film, dance, gallery, music, literature, variety arts, and puppetry. Each event contains a synopsis of the show and biographical information on the artists. The website also provides information on their resident artists; performance, literary, and dance series; their annual Hot! festival; the Tom Murrin Performance Award; and their cultural and community outreach programs to seniors and youth. In 2020, the Youtube channel was added to capture contents related to Dixon Place's virtual activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also includes a radio play called BlackBlade. BlackBlade is a 4 part radio play presented by Dixon Place as part of the Titan Cycle.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dixon Place is an experimental nonprofit theater in New York that supports original theater, puppetry, dance, music, and circus arts. It was first conceived in 1985 in the Paris apartment of artistic director Ellie Covan. In 1986, Covan began the theater in her East First Street apartment with a weekly reading series called "Tuesdays at Dixon Place." In 1991, Dixon Place moved to a location on the Bowery and in 1999 became the resident company at Vineyard Theater. Dixon Place served as an incubator for artists such as Deb Margolin, Blue Man Group, John Leguizamo, Lisa Kron, David Cale, Penny Arcade, and Reno. In 2009, Dixon Place moved into its permanent home on Chrystie Street. The space consists of a 150 person theater, lounge, and bar.</field>
