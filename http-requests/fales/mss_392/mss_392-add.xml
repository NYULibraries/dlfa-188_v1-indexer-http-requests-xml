    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gael Greene (born December 22, 1933) is an American restaurant critic, author and novelist. Greene is a graduate of the University of Michigan, and became New York magazine's restaurant critic in 1968. The American edition of The Foodie Handbook credits Greene with being the first person to use the word "foodie".</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Greene famously went to great lengths to conceal her identity from restaurateurs, reserving and using credit cards under other names, and wearing hats that covered her eyes in photographs, on television, and in public appearances. Her writing inspired and documented the city's growing interest in food and dining out.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">For more than 30 years, she served as New York magazine's "Insatiable Critic" and then continued as a columnist until 2008, the magazine's 40th anniversary as well as her own. She was then fired. The coverage surrounding her dismissal seemingly sparked a revival of interest in Greene, leading to appearances as a judge on the TV show Top Chef Masters and international requests for interviews focused on her web site, Insatiable Critic.com.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1981 she co-founded Citymeals-on-Wheels, along with the teacher and food writer James Beard, to help fund weekend and holiday meals for homebound elderly people in New York City. She remains an active chair of the company's board, hosting an annual Power Lunch for Women. Greene has received numerous awards for her work with Citymeals and in 1992 was honored as Humanitarian of the Year by the James Beard Foundation. She is the winner of the International Association of Cooking Professionals' magazine writing award (2000) and a Silver Spoon from Food Arts magazine.</field>
