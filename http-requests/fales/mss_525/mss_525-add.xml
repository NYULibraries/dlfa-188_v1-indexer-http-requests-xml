    <field name="custodhist_teim">This collection was compiled from material held by Kondoleon's family and friends.  After Kondoleon's death in 1994, his sister, Christine Kondoleon, took custody of a large portion of the collection.  She added materials from their parents's home Queens, New York.  A core group of materials, including notebooks and manuscripts, was reviewed and arranged by Don Shewey, one of Kondoleon's close friends.  Stephen Soba contributed his collection of correspondence from Kondoleon.  Prior to their transfer to New York University, materials were assessed and reviewed by Fales Librarian for Archival Collections Nicholas Martin at the homes of Christine Kondoleon and Stephen Soba; during those visits materials were packed and curatorial decisions were made. The materials that comprise this collection were transferred from Christine Kondoleon's home in Cambridge, Massachusetts to the Fales Library at New York University.</field>
