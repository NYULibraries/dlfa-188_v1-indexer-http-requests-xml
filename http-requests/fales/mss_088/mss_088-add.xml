    <field name="abstract_teim">Redtape, edited and published by Michael Carter, was an East Village "zine" which throughout its run espoused innovative visual and literary expression while encouraging interplay between those two forms. The magazine, featuring comics, poetry, fiction, graphic art, and photography, provided a venue for both established and emerging writers and artists of the downtown scene. The collection includes a complete run of the magazine, mock-up copies and galleys, original art work, copies of art work, photographs, manuscripts and related correspondence, newspaper clippings, posters and flyers for readings, benefit parties and other events organized by Redtape participants.</field>

The earliest materials submitted to the publication are dated 1972; however, the bulk of the material spans 1980-1992 (the period of the magazine's publication). The Collection contains many undated and/or unsigned documents, which, whenever possible, were identified using the published issues of the magazine and filed accordingly. Oversized archival materials from the various series are located in an oversize box at the end of the collection. All posters are located in the map case.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">NOTE: Oversized material is in the numerical sequence of the series to which it belongs, though contained in separate boxes. </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Redtape, one of the East Village "zines", employing a magazine form to communicate innovative artistic ideas, divided its pages between literature and graphics, encouraging an interplay between writers and visual artists. According to the editor and publisher of Redtape Michael Carter the purpose of the magazine was "to explore new possibilities and forms of expression, to develop craft and technique without becoming sequestered in an intellectual or academic ivory tower". The magazine, featuring comics, poetry, fiction, graphic art, and photography, provided a venue for both established and emerging writers and artists of the downtown scene.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Intended initially as a quarterly publication, Redtape released seven issues in 10 years, each having a unique format and organized around specific theme: 'For the Left Side of Your Brain' (1982), 'Assemblage' (1982), 'Redtape: Double Summer Issue' (1983) , 'ArtDamaged' (1984), 'White Lies' ( 1984), 'The Cracked Mirror' (1986) and 'Tragicomix' (1992). Issue No. 3 was the first time Carter consciously reached out to the art community. Since then, every issue expanded the list of contributors and the scope of the publication, making the magazine a part and product of the Lower East Side scene. From the fourth issue onwards, the magazine was published on glossy paper, capable of high-quality graphic reproduction.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Contributors to the magazine included Kathy Acker, Peter Chereches, Constance De Jong, John Farris, Richard Hambleton, Greer Lankton, Patrick McGrath, Lynne Tillman and David Wojnarowicz among many others.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The Redtape Archive was acquired via purchase from its editor, Michael Carter in 1996. The collection was sorted by Marvin J. Taylor once it arrived at NYU. Archival materials were sorted into a series and processed later.</field>
