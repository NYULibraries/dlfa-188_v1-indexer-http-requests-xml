    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The A Gathering of the Tribes Records (1983-2012) documents the operations and programs of A Gathering of the Tribes, which served as a neighborhood arts center through its gallery, performance space, as well as a literary magazine and book publisher for artists, writers, and performers. This collection contains paper, computer files, and audiovisual recordings generated by A Gathering of the Tribes while the organization served as a gathering space for lesser-known, local New York City artists and writers during the 1990s to the 2010, providing a space to form networks and host events supporting the arts in the East Village. This collection includes video and audio recordings, publicity material, guest books, and scrapbooks documenting the organization's performances, readings, and gallery openings. Project files typically contain correspondence; Fly By Night Press manuscript submissions; artist submissions for the gallery; and business and administrative records. Grant files chronicle A Gathering of the Tribes' pursuit of funding through extensive individual source files, providing insight into the financial struggles of a small New York arts organization through applications, rejection letters, correspondence, and final reports. A small selection of ephemera and writings by Tribes founder Steve Cannon include essays, plays, and short stories, some of which were co-written, while others were produced with the assistance of a transcriber due to Cannon's visually-impaired status. The publications series contains printed material published by Fly By Night Press, or in some way associated with A Gathering of the Tribes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">A Gathering of the Tribes was a performance space, art gallery, literary magazine, and small print publisher in New York's East Village. Founded in 1991 by Steve Cannon in his brownstone apartment building, Tribes began as an informal salon for cultural exchange between poets, artists, musicians and performers. The collaborative, explorative work done in the space culminated in the founding of the A Gathering of the Tribes magazine, whose first issue was published in the autumn of 1991. Since its inception, A Gathering of the Tribes sought to engage with and promote work from multi-cultural, interdisciplinary, and underrepresented writers and artists. A Gathering of the Tribes was a contributor to the East Village literary, artistic and performance scene alongside such venues as Nuyorican Poets Cafe and the Living Theatre. In 1993, a portion of the space became the Tribes Gallery, hosting exhibitions, readings, and performances. 
In April of 2014 both the organization and Steve Cannon were forced to relocate and the gallery permanently closed when the occupancy agreement with the person to whom the building had previously been sold ended. Fly By Night Press stopped publishing in 2018, but Tribes magazine continutes to publishing online. Steve Cannon passed away in 2019.</field>
