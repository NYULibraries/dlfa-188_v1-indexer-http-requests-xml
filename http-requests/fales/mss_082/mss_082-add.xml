The March Street Press later published a collection of her works entitled The Paris Poems in 2004 and in 2010 Nostrand released Variations with the same independent publisher. In response to The Paris Poems, American poet, editor, and activist, Ron Kolm claimed that, "Sudie Nostrand has that very rare ability to make the spiritual manifest (The Paris Poems)." </field>

In addition to her published work, Nostrand participated in various public readings in New York City.
