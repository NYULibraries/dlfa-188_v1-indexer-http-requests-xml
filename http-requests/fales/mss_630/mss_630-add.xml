    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Julie Saul Gallery Records document a New York City art gallery active during the late 1980s to 2019 that specialized in photography. This collection includes files accumulated by the Gallery on artists they represented including Richard Artschwager, Reinier Gerritsen, Bill Jacobson, Sara Anne Johnson, and Tseng Kwong Chi. Artist files often include press clippings, correspondence, resumes, artwork images, exhibition information, notes, and lists of the artworks and their prices. The collection also contains both chronological and individual Gallery exhibition files. These files typically contain promotional material, press releases, catalogs, correspondence, press clippings, notes, and artists' statements and resumes. Exhibition files containing a significant amount of material include Sally Gall -- Subterranea; Skin/Deep; Uncharted Territory; and Wordplay. 


Gallery sales and consignment records range in date from the 1990s to the 2010s, documenting transactions between the gallery owner and purchasers, including other galleries, museums, and private collectors. These records track artwork pricing; the ebb and flow in popularity of artists and their works; and art mediums. The Gallery's payment receipts for individual artists illustrate the gallery/artist relationship in terms of profit-sharing, volume of purchases, and price tracking on individual artists. This collection also contains a small amount of documentation on the establishment of the original gallery with Nancy Lieberman in the 1980s; files accumulated on individual collectors; bills and expense lists; and press clippings regarding Julie Saul's early career and the Gallery.


Notes and copies of readings for photography art classes Saul attended in the 1980s are in this collection, as are notes and syllabi for classes she later taught on the subject. Julie Saul's travel journals date from 2002 to 2016, and include business and personal diary-type entries while visiting various parts of the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. These diaries also contain business contact information and meeting notes. There are also files related to Saul's outside projects during the 2000s-2010s including a Printed Matter portfolio project; research on French art dealer Berthe Weill; and The Color Project in which she partnered with Eileen Cohen.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Julie Saul (1954-2022) was an American gallerist. She was educated as an art historian and curator. In the early 1980s she and Nancy Lieberman decided to establish a gallery to promote and sell photography. Saul eventually broke off with her own gallery in the 1990s and was known as a major exhibitor and supporter of traditional and avant-garde contemporary photography. In addition to the Gallery, Saul taught history of photography classes and also worked for 20 years on a project to promote the life and legacy of Berthe Weill, an early-20th-century Parisian art dealer.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Julie Saul Gallery initially began as Lieberman &amp; Saul Fine Arts in 1984 where Saul and Nancy Lieberman worked as private dealers specializing in contemporary photographic-based art and works on paper. In 1986 they opened their first public space at 155 Spring Street and moved to 560 Broadway where Saul eventually transitioned the gallery to the Julie Saul Gallery in 1990. The Gallery began accumulating a balance of works on paper, collage, sculpture, painting, and video. Their location changed again, moving to 535 West 22nd Street in Chelsea, an area that many SoHo galleries were moving to in the mid-1990s. In addition to solo exhibitions for artists, the Gallery also curated an average of two thematic shows per year, often incorporating an historical component. Examples of these shows include Synapse Between Photography and Sculpture (1992), Richard Artschwager: Photo/Works 1945/1996,and Skin/Deep: A survey of interior imaging from X-Ray to MRI (1999). Artists represented included photographers Sally Gall, Andrew Bush, and Arne Svenson, as well as multimedia artists Richard Artschwager, Sarah Anne Johnson, and Maira Kalman. Saul closed the Gallery in 2019 when she lost her lease.</field>
