    <field name="abstract_teim">Kenneth Neill Cameron was a literary scholar and professor who specialized in English Romantic poetry and, especially, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his contemporaries. He was the editor of "Shelley and His Circle" volumes one through four, a celebrated chronological retrospective and catalogue of Percy Bysshe Shelley's (and his contemporaries') works. Kenneth Neill Cameron continued to write about Shelley and his circle of contemporaries throughout his life, but also developed an interest in and wrote about Marxist philosophy, history, and politics (which was partly inspired by Shelley-and-Circle's rebelliousness). The materials in this collection include Cameron's early academic works, correspondence, and a manuscript of a play.</field>
