    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Center for Medical Consumers was founded in 1976 to educate consumers to ask questions regarding major medical treatments including long-term drug therapy and elective surgery. A free medical library was opened to provide consumers access to the same medical journals, reference books, and text books that are available to medical professionals. The Center decided to closed the library in 2001 with the onset of the widespread use of the internet. The Center also published its monthly newsletter, "Health Facts," in print from 1976-2009 and digitally from 2009-2012. For most of its existence, Judson Memorial Church provided an office space for the Center at no cost. Funding for the Center comes from small grants, royalties generated by published articles, and private donors.</field>
