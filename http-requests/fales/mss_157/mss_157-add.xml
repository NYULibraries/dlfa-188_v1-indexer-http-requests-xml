    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sarah Jacobson was born in Norwalk, Connecticut in 1971. Her family moved to Edina, Minnesota, where Jacobson graduated from high school. As a teenager, Sarah Jacobson was drawn to the independent film and music scene in Minneapolis. After graduating from Edina High School in 1989, Sarah Jacobson attended Bard College for her freshman year. Dissatisfied with Bard, Jacobson moved to San Francisco to attend the San Francisco Art Institute where she met her mentor, George Kuchar.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While still in film school, Sarah Jacobson wrote, produced and directed her first films including, The Adventures of Sweet Miss: The Disco Years and I Was A Teenage Serial Killer. Shortly after graduating from college, Jacobson, wrote, directed and produced her first feature-length film, Mary Jane's Not A Virgin Anymore, which screened internationally. Sarah Jacobson was a firm believer in "DIY" or the "Do It Yourself" method of filmmaking. With her mother, Ruth Jacobson, she established her own production company, Station Wagon Productions, to handle the distribution of her film projects in keeping with the "DIY" manifesto. Jacobson also did some commercial work for VH1, Oxygen Media and is known to have shot at least one music video for the British punk band Fluffy. Sarah Jacobson's influences include filmakers George Kuchar, Jim Jarmusch, Susan Seidelman, John Hughes, Tamra Davis, Alison Anders, and the musical groups Babes In Toyland, Heavens to Betsy, L7 and Gas Huffer.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to her film projects, Jacobson did freelance writing for several publications including YM,Sassy,Film Threat,Punk Planet andFilth. Sarah Jacobson also considered herself an activist, not only through her own film work and teaching but through her involvement with 50/50, a feminist collective that sought to attain gender equality in the film and televison industry.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sarah Jacobson passed away on February 13th, 2004 due to uterine cancer. Before her death, Jacobson was developing Sleaze, a film chronicling the life of a 15-year-old girl who hooks up with an all-girl rock band touring Missoula, Montana. Sleaze appears to be inspired by the film, Ladies and Gentlemen the Fabulous Stains (Written by Nancy Dowd and Directed by Lou Alder) for which Jacobson made a short documentary. Her last films included a documentary about her 10-year high school reunion and True Love Mohawk, documenting Jacobson and her boyfriend, Aaron Zisman giving each other mohawks.</field>
