Many of the correspondents are fellow clergymen. The subjects of the correspondence principally include pleasantries and expressions of spirituality, especially in relation to dealing with difficulties, being favored with luck, matters of health or illness, and other fortunes or misfortunes of life. There is some commentary on finding preaching positions, performing clerical duties and seeking to redeem sinners. In this connection, there is an unsent 1788 letter from Lowe in which he expresses frustration that his church will not allow African-Americans to become members; he details the objections of the members and his answers to those objections.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Reverend Peter Lowe was born on April 30th, 1764, in Esopus (now Kingston), New York, where he received his preparatory academic education.  From an early age, Lowe displayed a propensity for serious study and a love of reading, particularly of the Holy Bible and other religious texts.  He pursued his theological studies in the city of New York under the tutelage of the Reverend Dr. John Livingston, a prominent minister and theological scholar.  Upon completing his studies at the age of twenty-four, Lowe accepted a call to serve as Collegiate Pastor over a combination of six churches in Kings County (Long Island), the locations being in Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, New-Utrecht, Brooklyn, and Bushwick.  Along with the Reverend Martin Schoonmaker, Lowe faithfully executed his pastoral duties for the next twenty-one years.  Lowe lived with his wife and children in Flatbush, and when the union of the six churches was dissolved "by mutual consent, for the sake of a more frequent supply of the word and ordinances,"  Rev. Lowe continued to serve the parishes of Flatbush and Flatlands for another nine years, until his death from cancer in June of 1818.  Unwavering as a man of faith, Lowe remained committed to serving his parish during his illness, even delivering his last sermon in his own sick room a few days before his death.</field>
