    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials found in this series track organizations that worked in tandem with the Brooklyn Division and its predecessors or that were subsumed by the Brooklyn Division, most notably the Brooklyn Federation of Churches.  This series is primarily composed of reports and minutes from these organizations.  Most often represented in this series is the Brooklyn Federation of Churches.  The series contains minutes of both the Federation as a whole and of its smaller committees.  The minutes of the Federation trace the social concerns, community involvement, and organization of this group during its 12 years of existence, including the reasons behind the Federation's merger with the Brooklyn Church and Mission Society.</field>
