    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment (BCUE) was first founded in 1978 as the Prospect Park Environmental Center or PPEC. Its founder John Muir started the organization with a few volunteers as a response to a growing urban crisis. He served as executive director and president until December of 2001. Its original intent was to teach environmental stewardship and protection in Prospect Park and its nearby neighborhoods; the center expanded to serve every neighborhood in Brooklyn and parts of New York City. The staff of BCUE led many school programs, workshops for teachers, and walking tours for adults. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The organization called several places its home; from its initial headquarters at the Picnic House and later move to the Tennis House on Prospect Park West, to Floyd Bennett Field and finally Gowanus. The organization dropped "Brooklyn" from its name some time in 2008 and became the Center for the Urban Environment (CUE) as it provided programing and workshops throughout New York City. The nonprofit organization abruptly announced it was closing its doors on April 6, 2009. </field>
