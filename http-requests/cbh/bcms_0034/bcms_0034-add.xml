    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials in this collection include mortgages, receipts &amp; financial statements, miscellaneous legal documents, internal church documents, and correspondence. Most of the materials concern the Church's financial instability and reflect debts owed by the church and transfers of its property. The materials document African American church history in Brooklyn and offer evidence of early financial and business dealings within Brooklyn's free African American community. The collection contains many autograph documents signed by church officials and other legal authorities. Individuals whose names and/or autographs figure in this collection include: Oliver Fields, Peter Lee, Warren Mitchell, William Mitchell, Benjamin Portland, Lemuel Richardson, John G. Spence, Eugene Valentine, Major West, Thomas Wilson, and Thomas Worlds.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The A.M.E. Zion Church of Williamsburgh was located on North Second Street near Union Avenue, one of the borough's first neighborhoods inhabited in sizeable numbers by African Americans freed when New York State abolished slavery in 1827. Williamsburgh was a separate village, then a city, until it consolidated with Brooklyn in 1854.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> The A.M.E. Zion Churches were a nationwide league of congregations founded in New York in 1820 by and for the African American religious community. Like the related, but separate, A.M.E. Churches, they were established and patronized by black Methodists who withdrew from the white-dominated Methodist churches as a reaction to the racism of the majority white Methodist community and to its reticence to take an organized stand against slavery as a religious issue. Members of the A.M.E. Zion Churches were actively involved in abolition work and were widely rumored to have used some of their church locations as covert Underground Railroad stations. The A.M.E. Zion Churches were progressive in other ways as well: in 1891, the A.M.E. Zion Church became one of the first major denominations to ordain women. Noted members of the nationwide A.M.E. Zion Churches included Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Jermain Loguen, and Frederick Douglass.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> In 1885, Brooklyn's original A.M.E. Zion Church merged with a nearby congregation, the First A.M.E. Zion Church at Tompkins Avenue at McDonough Street in Bedford-Stuyvesant and relocated to its property. In March 1980, more than a hundred years after the A.M.E. Zion Church of Williamsburgh defaulted on its lease and lost its house of worship, the First A.M.E. Zion Church successfully paid off its final $54,000 mortgage payment, after which church officials burnt the mortgage documents in celebration.</field>
