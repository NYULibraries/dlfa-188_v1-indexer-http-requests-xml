    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, Dr. Carlos Russell recalls that he and his family were in the "diaspora'' of Panamanian-West Indians. His grandparents came from Barbados and Jamaica, and other relatives came from some of the French West Indies. He opines that in Panama many of the West Indians who spoke English in the past have now turned to Spanish because English speakers were looked down upon. In the seventies and eighties, however, things changed and some Panamanians of West Indian descent have been appointed to government positions. Dr. Russell thinks that most of the youngsters who come to the United States from Panama in 1988 are not as ambitious as his generation, and the few who are politically active identify more with Latin America than with the West Indies. This attitude is prevalent in Panama as well, where there is a major Latinization among the West Indian descended communities. Interview conducted by Morton Marks.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dr. Carlos Russell was born in Panama. Dr. Russell grew up in the two Panamas; the West Indian one and the Latino/a one. His parents were separated, so he lived in Panama City with his mother and would travel to the ''West Indian'' city of Col√≥n to see his father. He studied at the National Institute in Panama and attended the Episcopal Church. In 1955 Dr. Russell left Panama and went to Chicago. There, Dr. Russell got involved in politics in the Panamanian-West Indian community and also in the Black American community. Later, after having spent a number of years in Brooklyn, he was instrumental in arranging the National Conference of Panamanians in the Poconos, and is a founder of ''El Bahiano,'' the first Panamanian-West Indian newspaper to be published in both English and Spanish. As a Dean of the School of Contemporary Studies at Brooklyn College, he along with others began to promote cultural activities and to participate more in Panamanian politics both here and in Panama. In 1988, he resided in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.</field>
