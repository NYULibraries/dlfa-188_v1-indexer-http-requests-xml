    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, Alonso Wilson de Briano weaves high points of his personal journey and professional development with reverence for songwriters and musicians. The music that Wilson developed is known as Windsor style, and it combines Afro-Panamanian, Cuban, and West Indian musical elements. It sounds like a blend of mambo and calypso, and it was the popular music of Panamanian-West Indians arriving in Brooklyn in the 1950s. In Wilson's own words, Panama is a country ''with a foot in each side;" one coming from the Latino/a side and the other from the English-speaking West Indies. Wilson feels that Panamanian-West Indian culture is becoming more and more Latinized, both in Brooklyn and in Panama. Interview conducted by Morton Marks.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Alonso Wilson de Briano was born in 1930s Panama and became interested in music at an early age, due to the influence of his father, a choir master. Wilson attended the Conservatory of Music of Panama and then continued his studies at the National Institute of Panama. He wrote a number of musical compositions that received recognition, and was a member of the Cleff Melodiers, an all-male choral group that performed American spirituals. Wilson came to the United States seeking economic betterment and success in his musical career. In the mid-1950s, he lived briefly in Manhattan and in Roosevelt, Long Island, but when the rest of his family arrived they settled in Brooklyn. In 1958 he performed with a quintet called "Windsor Club" at the Carnegie Recital Hall in a program called "Modern Expressions in the Music of Panama.'' He then formed a Latin band and continued to perform with different groups in the Bronx. Following his graduation from Brooklyn College, he attempted to return to Panama but employment conditions forced him to return to New York. Wilson lived in Long Island in 1988, where he taught music in a local high school.</field>
