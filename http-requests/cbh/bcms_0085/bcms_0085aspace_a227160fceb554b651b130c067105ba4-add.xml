    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included here are papers related to Schiller's involvement, under the auspices of the "Emergency Committee Opposing the Mill Basin Incinerator," with the Mill Basin community's successful fight against various New York City governmental agencies to keep an incinerator, marine wast-transfer station, and Department of Sanitation garage from being built in the Mill Basin neighborhood. Also found here are Schiller's incoming and outgoing correspondence with various New York City and State elected officials, including State Senator William Rosenblatt, State Assemblyman Lawrence Murphy, and City Councilman Morris Stein and Sam Curtis, as well as community leaders from adjacent neighborhoods, including Charles Bugeja, chairman of Marine Park Civic Association, with whom further correspondence can be found in Subseries B. Also included are Schiller's own notes related to various meetings and events, minutes from community meetings, copies of petitions containing Mill Basin residents' signatures and addresses, as well as various captioned photographs of Mill Basin and the incinerator near Avenue J.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Supplemental material is in the last folder of the series, as well as in the first folder of photographs (Aerial Views of Mill Basin). Supplemental material consists of photocopies of articles from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle which serve to contextualize the activities documented in this subseries, by showing evidence of earlier attempts to build an incinerator in Mill Basin, dating back to 1928. The photograph which was been added to the collection depicts an aerial view of Mill Basin with an area marked off in organe grease pencil and an arrow pointing to this area. The photo was removed to this collection from the folder "Incinerators" in BCMS.0002 (Brooklyn Daily Eagle photographs).</field>
