    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries contains information about the naming of two parks in the Mill Basin neighborhood: Charles W. Boyce Square, named after the past president of the Mill Basin Civic Association from 1941-1963, and Captain Vincent Hickman Park, named after a Mill Basin resident who was killed in action in Vietnam in 1964. Included in this subseries is documentation related to getting local law passed to create and name the parks, as well as the parade and dedication ceremony that was held to commemorate opening of the parks. Extensive documentation in the form of letters, sketches and blueprints for plaques for the parks, Schiller's hand-drawn sketches of the parade line-up and route can also be found here, as well as the official "Proclamation of Mill Basin Dedication Day," a large ceremonial certificate, signed by Abe Stark. The parade and dedication ceremony, which took place on October 17, 1965, was attended by many community leaders, including then-Brooklyn borough president Abe Stark who gave the address at the Hickman Park dedication. Many RSVP letters from invitees to the dedication ceremony are included. A photograph of Boyce Square, prior to its being renovated to a park can also be found in this subseries. A folder of material from two John F. Kennedy memorial dedications, one of which involved Schiller, can be found in its own folder. From Schiller's correspondence it appears that he aspired that the dedication ceremony he planned for these two parks would live up to some of the aspects of the Kennedy Memorial ceremony he participated in and admired.</field>
