    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brooklyn High School newspaper collection consists of news publications from Brooklyn high schools. School news receives the most attention in the papers, but community events, as well as matters of national and international interest, are reported on as well. One example of this coverage is the writing done by students – in essays, interviews, poems, and reporting – on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The bulk of the papers in the collection span the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s. Many famous Brooklynites appear in the pages of these publications, such as Bobby Fischer (Erasmus Hall High School), Janet Yellen (Fort Hamilton High School), and Bernie Sanders (James Madison High School).</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">This is an artifical collection created by Brooklyn Collection staff. Some of the papers were originally sent to Brooklyn Public Library for patron use. The specific source of the majority of the collection is unknown.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">The digital surrogates for this collection should be used in place of the originals whenever possible. If the originals must be used, the researcher should note that the majority of the materials in this collection are stored offsite and advance notice is required for use.
