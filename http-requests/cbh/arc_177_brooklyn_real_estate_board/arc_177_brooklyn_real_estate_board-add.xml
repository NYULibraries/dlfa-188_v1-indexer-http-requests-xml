    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brooklyn Real Estate Board magazines and bulletins are comprised of issues of two monthly publications produced by the Board, Brooklyn Realty Magazine and Realty Facts.  Issues of Brooklyn Realty Magazine span the period March 1926 to July 1943, while issues of Realty Facts span the period June 1947 to June 1950.  The publications contain news and information regarding real estate laws, developments, and business activities in Brooklyn, as well as calendars of events.  While the collection contains most issues of both publications for the aforementioned date ranges, it does not contain the complete run of either publication.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Brooklyn Real Estate Board was founded in 1905 and held its offices in the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce Building at 66 Court Street.  It later relocated to 44 Court Street.  The Board's mission was "to maintain a watchful attitude over the interests of the community, keeping careful check over pending legislation affecting real estate, in municipal, state and national legislative halls, and to organize and direct the vigorous powers of real estate owners in support or opposition to these various legislative measures."  The Board's membership was initially confined to real estate professionals, but later became open to all property-owning Brooklyn residents.  The Board also issued two monthly news publications: Brooklyn Realty Magazine, the first issue of which was published in May of 1926, and Realty Facts, a bulletin that was first issued in June of 1947.  These publications served to provide real estate news and information to the Board's members and all property owners living in Brooklyn.</field>
