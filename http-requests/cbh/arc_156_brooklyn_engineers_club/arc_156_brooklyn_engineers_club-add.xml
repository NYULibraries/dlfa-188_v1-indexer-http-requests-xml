    <field name="abstract_teim">The Brooklyn Engineers' Club publications span the years 1897 to 1973 and are housed in four manuscript boxes. Included in the collection are annual proceedings and monthly bulletins published by the Club. The Brooklyn Engineers' Club was incorporated on December 29, 1896. The purpose of the Club was to promote social and professional intercourse and to advance engineering knowledge and practice. Membership consisted of four levels: Corporate, Associate, Non-resident, and Honorary members. Corporate and Associate members were required to either live or work in one of the five boroughs of New York City. The Brooklyn Engineers' Club clubhouse was located at 117 Remsen Street (between Clinton and Henry Streets) in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights. As of 2010, the brownstone building was the home to Congregation B'nai Avraham and to Kiddie Korner Preschool.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brooklyn Engineers' Club publications span the years 1897 to 1973 and are housed in four manuscript boxes. Included in the collection are annual proceedings and monthly bulletins published by the Club.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The proceedings were originally published annually and later (circa 1920) quarterly--in January, April, July, and October. The proceedings contain the Club's constitution and bylaws; membership lists (includes name of member, their work title, their work address, and date the member was elected into the Club); proceedings from the annual meeting; reports and addresses from officers; papers read at regular meetings throughout the year (includes content, images, graphs, fold-out drawings, and transcripts of the discussions that followed the paper presentations); member obituaries (if applicable); lists of new additions to the library; and an index to advertisements.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Bulletin was published monthly except during the months of June, July, August, and September. In 1956, the title of the publication was changed to The Brooklyn Engineer. The bulletin served as a forum to notify members of upcoming meetings, the agenda for the meetings, and general news updates such as the latest applications for membership. The meetings generally began with the discussion of Club related business, followed by a presentation of a paper pertaining to engineering. Examples of papers presented include "Mechanical Methods of Stress Analysis;" "The Brooklyn Waterfront;" and "The Kill Van Kull Bridge." </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Engineering has been inextricably linked to New York State since the early 19th century, as it was the birthplace of professional engineering in the United States. The U.S. Military Academy at West Point, located 50 miles north of New York City along the Hudson River, offered civil engineering as an academic subject when it was founded in 1802. In 1835, Rensselaer Institute (now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), also located along the Hudson River in Troy, N.Y., granted the first civil engineering degrees in the United States. The first professional engineering society in the United States also originated in New York--the Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE) was founded in New York City in 1852. In Brooklyn, the Polytechnic Institute (now Polytechnic Institute of NYU), founded in 1854, is regarded as the second oldest private school of engineering and technology in the United States. </field>
