    <field name="abstract_teim">The Hubbard family papers characterize the business and legal transactions of father Elias Hubbard (died 1832), and son Elias Hubbard (died 1864) in the town of Flatlands (now part of Brooklyn), in Kings County, New York.

These papers contain evidence of the community involvement of Elias junior, as well as the role of Elias senior in the American Revolutionary war. The collection also contains evidence of community dialogue and development through correspondence, meeting minutes and organizational documents; personal and political matters are also addressed through these materials. The collection's mortgages, deeds, wills, bonds, community tax records, enslaved persons' bills of sale, apprenticeship agreements and indentures display the economic and political forces surrounding the Hubbard family, as well as Brooklyn in general, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Hubbard family papers contain the legal, financial and business records of Elias Hubbard and his son, also named Elias. A large portion of the materials also concern Hubbard family life, and their role in the community of Flatlands, New York, where they resided. These materials provide insight into the economic, political and social climate of the town of Flatlands in the late 18th and early 19th century. In addition to Flatlands, Hubbard's papers encompass individuals from other areas, including New Utrecht, Gravesend, Flushing, and Monmouth and Somerset counties in New Jersey. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains mortgages, bonds, deeds, wills and other documents related to the land matters of the Hubbards. Also included are three indentures for servitude including those for a joyner, a household servant for the Hubbard family, and an indenture for the apprenticeship of Elias junior as a dry goods merchant. Many of the financial records concern the willing of the estates of family members and siblings to both Elias junior and Huldah Hubbard. The will of Elias senior is also included. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">References to enslaved African Americans appear throughout the collection, particularly seen in legal documentation concerning sale, purchase, and inheritance through wills. The collection contains five enslaved persons' bills of sale, four of which were to the Hubbard family. The freedom and financial support of enslaved people is also mentioned in the will of John. W. Holmes, father of Huldah.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A large portion of the collection focuses on involvement in local organizations, specifically surrounding Elias junior. This is seen through meeting minutes and statements which display his appointment to the delegation concerned with the Brooklyn City charter, secretarial appointment and host of Flatland's town meetings, creation of a clamming bill, and early Temperance Society formation. This collection also contains materials surrounding the involvement of the community in attaining corporate status for the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church, along with receipts for the purchase of pews and mention of donated books by Elias junior. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Documentation of school board correspondence with the Superintendent of Common Schools for the State of New York as well as with the commissioner, inspector and trustees of Common Schools in the town of Flatlands is also present. This correspondence argued for the removal of W. Johnson from his position as Preacher in Flatlands School District No. 1 based on reports of public intoxication, foul language and subversion of the Christian Religion. A list of taxable town inhabitants in the Flatland school district(1833), and documentation discussing Flatlands School District No. 1's financials is also included.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains material from the American Revolutionary War period, including documents related to Elias senior's involvement throughout the war; specifically an oath of allegiance to King George and a pass granted to Elias as per his declaration, as well as a proclamation by General William Howe of the British Army offering protection to the Loyalists of Long Island. There are also documents supporting Elias senior's rise through the ranks as a member of the Kings County Militia. Some documents concern the taking of goods and services from Elias by the Loyalist forces in the early stages of the war. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A small portion of this collection contains miscellaneous items that have no apparent connection to the Hubbard family including an enslaved person's bill of sale from Flushing, Queens, a broadside dedicated to the German Citizens of Bucks County and a Union College lottery ticket.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Hubbard family papers relate principally to Elias Hubbard (died 1832) and his son Elias Hubbard (died 1864). Huldah Hubbard (died 1851), who was the wife of Elias junior, is also represented in the collection, along with James Hubbard, father of Elias. The children of Elias senior and extended family of Huldah, including her father John Holmes and sister Catherine of New Jersey, are also mentioned in family wills.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Hubbards resided in the town of Flatlands (now part of Brooklyn), in Kings County, New York, with members of their extended family in New Jersey and Connecticut. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Elias Hubbard senior was born in Flatlands in 1746. During the American Revolutionary period he was involved in local militias in Brooklyn; his allegiance during the war is not completely apparent in the collection, with documents supporting his oath of loyalty to King George in 1776, as well as papers displaying his rank of Lieutenant and then Captain of a local Regiment of the Kings County Militia (circa 1784-1787). He was also a member of the Dutch Reformed Church of Flatlands. He owned various properties in Flatlands and was a slaveholder. Both Elias senior and junior are mentioned in the 1810 Flatlands census. Upon his death in 1832, he willed the majority of his property to his children, principally his son, Elias junior. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Elias junior was born in 1776.  He married Huldah Homes in 1801, and together they resided in Flatlands, N.Y. Elias junior owned property including a home, carriage and enslaved people; much of this property was inherited from his father. His apprenticeship as a dry goods merchant under the supervision of James V.H. Lawrence for five years is noted. Few materials reference his position as a lawyer, however there is no official documentation to support this title. Throughout his life, he held various offices in local organizations, specifically as secretary of the Flatlands Temperance Society, as a collector for the second district, and as a delegate of the Brooklyn City Charter. He participated in an effort in conjunction with members of the school board (Flatlands District No. 1) to remove an unfit teacher from the district. Like his father, he was also an active member of the Dutch Reformed Church of Flatlands. Elias died in 1864. </field>
