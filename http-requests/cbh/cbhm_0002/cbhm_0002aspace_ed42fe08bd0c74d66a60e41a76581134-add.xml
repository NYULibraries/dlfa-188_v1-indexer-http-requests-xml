    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Brooklyn Maqam Arab Music Festival was a celebration of Arab music traditions in Brooklyn held March 2-30, 2008. The Arabic word "maqam" refers to a group of musical notes and patterns of notes that form the building blocks of traditional Arab music. There are dozens of different maqamat, each of which creates its own characteristic sound and mood. BAC's Brooklyn Maqam included of a series of concerts, symposia, and workshops featuring nearly 100 New York-based musicians and groups representing musical traditions from Egypt, Yemen, Palestine, Iraq, Morocco, Syria and Lebanon. Musical programs included popular contemporary arrangements, folk traditions (both well-known and rare) and fusion pieces that integrate old and new styles. All events were open to the public free of charge. Brooklyn Arts Council staff involved in this project were Kay Turner, Folk Arts Director and Nicole Macotsis, Folk Arts Associate.</field>
