    <field name="bioghist_teim">Black Brooklyn Renaissance: Black Arts + Culture 1960-2010 (BBR) was developed and presented by Kay Turner, Folk Arts Director at the Brooklyn Arts Council. BBR was a two year-long research, planning, and public presentation initiative in partnership with Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. Beginning research in 2009 with major programming presented in 2010, BBR culminated in February 2011. Through field research, a series of public performances, exhibitions, panels and workshops, a scholarly conference, an oral history project, and other documentation, BBR celebrated the many ways Black performing artists, primarily those working in music, dance and spoken word, have contributed to the borough's significance as a center of Black culture in New York and the world.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">BBR's yearlong programming was held at major venues and community sites throughout Brooklyn, with select programs in Manhattan. Many of BBR's concerts, panels and workshops examined how migration, immigration, and political movements galvanized these cultural expressions while drawing attention to the evolving interplay between Afro-Caribbean, southern African American, and African traditions. The project also sought to create a dialogue between young contemporary artists and leading artists of the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Black Brooklyn artists of different generations and styles shared, learned and performed together.</field>
