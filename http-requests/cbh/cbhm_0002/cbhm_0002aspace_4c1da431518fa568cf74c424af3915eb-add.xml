    <field name="bioghist_teim">Days of the Dead in Brooklyn: Diverse Traditions of Death, Dying and Renewal was a year-long project begun in September 2008 to acquaint the public with traditional arts, rituals and customs used to address the deaths of family and community members in Brooklyn. The project included field research, documentation and 12 public programs (5 concert/performances, 7 lectures/demonstrations/workshops/symposia) held throughout Brooklyn from September 2008-June 2009.  Over 1,400 people attended DoDB events and 160 artists participated in the initiative. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The goals for the project were to heighten awareness of traditional arts practices related to death through engaging public programs and field research activities, to bridge the gap between diverse communities and health care systems, and to work toward a model for integrating traditional arts practices relating to death into public programming and health care practices. </field>
