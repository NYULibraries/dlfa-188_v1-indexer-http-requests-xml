    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Young People's Baptist Union of Brooklyn was organized in 1877 and was comprised of young members of Brooklyn's several Baptist churches.  The Union was devoted to Christian fellowship and community service, and among its various activities was the conducting of a summer camp and retreat, originally called the Fresh Air Home (1), which was established in 1909.  In 1914, the camp became known as Sunshine Acres and was moved to Commack, Long Island.  To reflect the involvement of the Long Island Baptist community in its activities, the Union modified its name in 1916 to the Young People's Baptist Union of Brooklyn and Long Island.  As of 2010, the Union continues to operate, though it concentrates solely on the running of Sunshine Acres, presently located in Napanoch, N.Y.</field>
