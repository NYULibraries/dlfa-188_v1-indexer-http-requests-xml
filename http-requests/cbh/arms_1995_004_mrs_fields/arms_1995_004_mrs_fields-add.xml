    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Mrs. Field's Literary Club was founded in 1884 by Mrs. Mary J. Field (Mrs. George White Field) as a social club for her students and other women in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. The purpose of the Club is to bring "together members of Mrs. Field's Club for literary culture and for social discourse." The social meetings of the Club generally took place monthly at members' residences during which members presented essays on literature, art and music, or performed plays. Writers and educators who were not members of the Club have also been invited to present at meetings, such as Pandita Ramabai, William Butler Yeats, and Arthur S. Hardy. The Mrs. Field's Literary Club inspired the formation of the Twentieth Century Club, another Brooklyn-based club devoted to appreciation of the arts and open to both men and women. The Mrs. Field's Literary Club is still active as of 2021.</field>
