    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection reflects the military career of Thomas A. Bartoloma. It includes training documents on scientific and mechanics subjects from 1951 and 1952, work papers from the 1960s and early 1970s regarding departmental procedures and retirement, and identification badges from the U.S.S. Ogden, U.S.S. Austin, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard for Thomas Bartoloma. The collection also contains pictures from the late 1940s and early 1950s of military personnel and the Material Laboratory softball team, of which Thomas Bartoloma was a mamber, as well as a Navy Yard Plaque made out to Thomas Bartoloma. The collection also includes issues of "The Shipworker" from the late 1940s, 1951, and 1965, pages from "The Shipworker Sports," and issues of "The Federal Machinist" dating from the mid to late 1960s. The issues of "The Federal Machinist" were published by District Lodge #44 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the AFL-CIO, and "The Shipworker" was published by the workers of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the Amred Forces Press Service. Bartoloma appeares in issues of "The Shipworkers Sports" as a Material Laboratory softball player. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"The Federal Machinist" provides insight into local labor unions, and "The Shipworker" and "The Shipworker Sports" provide insight into military life at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The photographs, training sheets, and identification cards also provide insight into the military career of Thomas Bartolomo. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Thomas Bartoloma was a mechanic at the Brooklyn Navy Yard during the early 1950s, and had identification badges for the U.S.S. Ogden, U.S.S. Austin, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Brooklyn Navy Yard was acquired by the United States government in 1801 to build naval vessels, and continued to build vessels until it ended operations in 1966. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the workforce at the Navy Yard had downsized due to outsourcing. While temporarily increasing due to the Korean War, the number of workers continued to decline until the Navy Yard's closure in 1966. </field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Immediate source of acquisition unknown. Materials were found in a repository in 2018 and an accession number was applied at that time.</field>
