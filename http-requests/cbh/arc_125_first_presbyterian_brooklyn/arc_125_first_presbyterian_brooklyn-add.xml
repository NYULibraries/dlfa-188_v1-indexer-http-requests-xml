    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The First Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn collection spans the period 1822 to 1992 and contains materials documenting First Church's regular activities, services, membership, administration, and history.  Items include subscription books, administrative reports, histories, church manuals and yearbooks, membership rolls, directories, news publications, and various printed ephemera such as programs, pamphlets, brochures, and bulletins.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Several of the news publications are compiled in bound volumes.  These include the Church's weekly bulletin, with issues dating from the periods 1933 to 1934, 1957 to 1958, and 1961 to 1962; the Church's monthly record of its work, titled The Field and the Work, with issues dating from 1914 to 1917; and the Church's monthly (later bimonthly) journal, The Church Lantern, with issues dating from 1934 to 1962.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The First Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn (commonly referred to as First Church) was founded in 1822.  Its building on Cranberry Street, featuring a distinct 120-foot clock tower, was the first church to be built in Brooklyn Heights.  In 1846, First Church's building was purchased by Plymouth Church, and First Church moved to a property on Henry Street between Pierrepont and Clark Streets.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">First Church had a number of distinguished pastors throughout the 19th century.  One such pastor was Dr. Samuel Hanson Cox, who served from 1837 to 1854.  Cox led First Church through a period known as the "Presbyterian schism," in which controversy erupted among American Presbyterians over a number of theological issues, the prospect of merging with the Congregationalists, and the moral implications of slavery.  Cox, regarded as "Brooklyn's first abolitionist," asserted that God's salvation was open to all regardless of race and allied himself with the more progressive Presbyterian sect known as the New School.  Cox's stance aroused suspicion from more traditionalist members of First Church, many of whom subsequently withdrew to join other churches or establish their own (most notably the Church of the Pilgrims).  Still, membership at First Church under Cox's leadership remained strong.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dr. Charles Cuthbert Hall, who served as pastor from 1877 to 1897, is also a notable figure in the history of First Church, having been largely responsible for revitalizing the church in a time when it faced declining membership and severe debt.  Hall brought in over 800 new members, increased revenues beyond expectations, made significant changes to the interior of the church, brought in the gifted organist and choir director Raymond Huntington Woodman (who served for over 70 years), and generally established First Church to a place of prominence in the Brooklyn community.  Hall later became President of Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Despite varying periods of decline in the 20th century brought on by dwindling finances, low membership, and unstable economic and social conditions, First Church persisted and established a unique identity in the Brooklyn community.  It underwent several architectural renovations and additions, embraced its role as a shelter for the sick and needy, engaged in social action, and fostered an increasingly multicultural congregation.  As of 2010, First Church continues to serve the Brooklyn community from its Henry Street location and is led by Reverend Stephen Phelps, who is serving in the capacity of Interim Senior Pastor.</field>
