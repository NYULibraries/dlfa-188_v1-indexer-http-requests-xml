    <field name="bioghist_teim">Since the early 19th century, New York City has been a major center for the publishing of women's magazines.  Some of the earliest titles included Lady's Weekly Miscellany (1805-1808) and Ladies' Literary Cabinet (1819-1822).  Later prominent titles published and edited in New York included Vogue (1892-), The Dilineator (1873-1937), Cosmopolitan (1886-), Good Housekeeping (1885-), and Ladies' Home Journal (1883-).  While for many decades these publications contained articles relating to such issues as fashion, domestic life, and activities of the social elite, in the 1960s they also began to carry articles reflecting the dramatic changes upheaving women's conventional social roles.  From the 1970s onward, women's magazines continued to flourish in New York City and covered an increasingly diverse range of issues.</field>
