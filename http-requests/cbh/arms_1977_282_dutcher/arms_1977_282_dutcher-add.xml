    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Silas B. Dutcher family papers span the period circa 1820 to 1930 and are housed in seven full manuscript boxes, one half-manuscript box, and two oversize boxes measuring 6.34 linear feet.  The majority of the collection is comprised of correspondence dating from 1861 to 1908 and relating to Dutcher's long career in business and politics, though there are also several items relating to the Dutcher family and the general social, political, and cultural backgrounds of the New York City area, New York State, and the United States.  The collection has been arranged into five series:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Business papers contain correspondence comprised of loose letters, letter books, and letter copy books, and involving Dutcher in his numerous official political and business capacities.  Family papers contain a small amount of correspondence relating to Rebecca and Edith Dutcher, as well as materials relating to Silas Dutcher's death in 1909.  The loose clippings and ephemera series relates to a wide range of political and social issues, as well as Dutcher's work as Supervisor of Public Works and his involvement in various political and civic organizations.  Scrapbooks contain news clippings and ephemera compiled by Rebecca and Jessie Dutcher and relating to general political and business issues, Silas Dutcher's political and business careers, religion, arts, and culture.  Awards and certificates are made out to Silas Dutcher and are from several organizations and institutions in which Dutcher served in varying capacities.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Silas Belden Dutcher (1829-1909) was born in Springfield, N.Y., as the second child of Parcefor and Johannah Low Frink Dutcher.  In his early years, Dutcher worked on the family farm and taught school.  In 1855, Dutcher moved to New York City and began his mercantile career.  He continued to work in trade until 1868, when he was compelled to focus exclusively on his rising political career.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dutcher's political career had begun in 1856, when he joined the newly-formed Republican Party.  He served his first position in public office as Supervisor of the City of New York from 1860 to 1861.  In 1868, Dutcher became Supervisor of the Internal Revenue, a position in which he served for four years before being appointed U.S. Pension Agent for the Eastern District of New York by President Ulysses S. Grant.  In 1877, Grant appointed Dutcher to the position of Appraiser of the Port of New York, and after serving in this position for three years, Dutcher was made State Supervisor of Public Works by New York Governor Alonzo B. Cornell.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dutcher also participated on various political committees.  He was chairman of the Kings County Republican Committee for four years, a member of the State Republican Committee, and chairman of the Executive Committee in 1876.  In 1896, New York Governor Levi P. Morton appointed him to the commission to frame the charter for Greater New York.  Dutcher was also a frequent delegate to Republican state and national conventions.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beyond his political activities, Dutcher maintained his business ties throughout most of his life.  From 1877 on, he was the director of Metropolitan Life Insurance.  He was a charter trustee of Union Dime between 1859 and 1902, and president of the company from 1885 to 1902.  In 1891, he became president of the Hamilton Trust Company.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beside his active political and business careers, Dutcher was also deeply involved in his family and religious lives.  In 1859, he married Rebecca Jacobs Alwaise.  Together they lived in Brooklyn and had 8 children over the next 20 years: Dewit Parcefor, Edith, Malcolm, Elsie, Myra, Jessie, and twins Eva and Edna.  Dutcher was an involved member of the Dutch Reformed Church, teaching Sunday school and serving as super of the Twelfth Street Reformed Church in Brooklyn for 10 years.  He was also a member of the Masonic Fraternity.</field>
