    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of five large scrapbooks containing news clippings and ephemera compiled by Dutcher's wife, Rebecca, and his daughter, Jessie.  Two of the scrapbooks contain articles clipped from various New York newspapers and relating to Dutcher's political and business careers, as well as several broad political and business issues.  Together, these two scrapbooks offer an exhaustive account of the general political and business climates of the New York City area, New York State, and, to a lesser extent, the United States, from the mid-19th to the early 20th centuries.  The remaining three scrapbooks also include articles on Dutcher's careers, but mainly focus on the personal interests of Rebecca and Jessie.  These scrapbooks contain clippings of articles on theater, fine arts, literature, fashion, culinary arts, religion, Brooklyn history, and general social and cultural news.  Clippings containing obituaries of personal friends, prominent New York citizens, and national celebrities are also included.  While the clippings mainly relate to the New York City area, they also contain information on national and international events and issues.  A variety of ephemera is also included in these three scrapbooks, including programs for theatrical productions, recitals, and lectures; commencement and excercise programs from various Brooklyn schools, including Girls' High School and Pratt Institute; programs for various community events; marriage invitations and announcements; advertisements; and images of performers and celebrities.  One of these latter scrapbooks is housed separately from the rest of the collection in an oversize box.</field>
