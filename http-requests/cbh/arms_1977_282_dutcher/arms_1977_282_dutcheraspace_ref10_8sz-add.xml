    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains a small amount of correspondence relating to certain members of the Dutcher family, and materials relating to Silas B. Dutcher's death in 1909.  The correspondence mostly concerns Dutcher's daughter, Edith, and the prospect of her taking a clerical position in the United States Pension Office, an arrangement made possible by her father.  Edith ultimately rejects the offer, owing to family committments at home, but recommends a cousin for the position.  The remainder of the correspondence is between Dutcher's widow, Rebecca, and the National Memorial, in which the Memorial requests to receive a photograph of the recently-deceased Dutcher.  Additional items relating to Dutcher's death include condolences sent to the Dutcher family from the State of New York, the Hamilton Trust Company, and other organizations and personal friends; and photocopies of obituaries of Dutcher clipped from various newspapers.  Finally, the series also includes a typed biography and genealogy of Dutcher, the author of which is unknown.</field>
