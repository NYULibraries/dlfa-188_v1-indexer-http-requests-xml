    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview took place on February 9, 1989 at Joseph R. Lentol's district office in Williamsburg.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Joseph R. Lentol was born on January 15, 1943. His mother was Matilda A. Postis and his father was New York State Assemblyman, Senator, and Supreme Court justice Edward S. Lentol. Before running for office, Lentol was Assistant District Attorney in Kings County.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lentol was first elected to the New York State Assembly for Assembly District (AD) 58 in 1972, running for an open seat after Assemblyman Chester Straub left to run for New York State Senator. He ran against Republican Vinny Abate in the 1972 and 1974 elections. In 1978, Roman Popadiuk ran against Lentol in the Democratic primary and Lentol won. Nick Stefanizzi, head of the local school board, ran campaigns against Lentol in the Democratic primaries in 1980 and 1982. These were close elections, but Lentol won both primaries. The 58th AD was redistricted and assigned a new number, AD 50, after the 1980 census. Fort Greene was added to this Assembly District in 1982.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Between 1983 and 2010, Lentol did not have any Democratic primary challengers. Andr√© Soleil, a lawyer, ran against Lentol in the 2010 Democratic primary. About 6,000 votes were cast in the 2010 primary and Lentol won by a wide margin. Lentol lost to Democrat Emily Gallagher in the 2020 election. There was a large voter turnout for the 2020 election, around 20,000 people.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During his time as a New York State Assemblyman, Lentol was the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Codes (1992-2020), the Committee on Governmental Employees, the Committee on Governmental Operations, and the Administrative Regulations Review Commission. Lentol was also Dean of the Brooklyn Delegation of the Assembly from 2001 to 2020, coordinating efforts that called on all Brooklyn Assemblymembers to work together on projects with borough-wide implications.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lentol advocated for waterfront and green space preservation, criminal justice reform, and affordable housing. In 2000, Lentol was selected to be a part of the Election Modernization Task Force, which made recommendations to the State on how to increase voter registration and turnout.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lentol was a part of the New York Conference of Italian-American Legislators and the New York State Legislative Pilots Association.</field>
