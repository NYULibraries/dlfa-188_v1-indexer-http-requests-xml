    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Gift of Barbara Whitehead, 2017.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Military records of Robert L. Beer and Harold Buehl and correspondence from Harold Buehl were originally donated to the Edward H. Nabb Research Center for Delmarva History and Culture at Salisbury University in 2008. In 2017, Barbara Whitehead requested those items be transferred to the Brooklyn Historical Society. The Center for Brooklyn History received these items from the Nabb Research Center in 2021.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Due to space constraints and scope, CBH decided to receive and accession from the donor only those materials most related to Brooklyn and the family members who lived there. </field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Castanets that Harold Buehl brought back from Spain after World War II and a November 26, 1972 issue of LI: Newsday's Magazine for Long Island were determined to be out of scope and discarded with the donor's permission.</field>
