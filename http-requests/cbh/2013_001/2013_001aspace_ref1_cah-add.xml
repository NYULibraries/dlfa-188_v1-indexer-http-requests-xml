    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview Kachmar discusses her childhood in the Downtown neighborhood of Brooklyn in the 1920s, which at the time was mostly comprised of immigrants who found employment at the nearby Brooklyn Navy Yard. There is much discussion of her mixed ethnic heritage; her father immigrated to United States from the Philippines and her mother was the child of a Czech immigrant. She also describes the multiethnic nature of the neighborhood and her elementary school, which was located in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn and was also mixed socioeconomically. There is much discussion on how her ethnicity affected her work life and personal relationships. The interview was conducted by Patricia Carino Pasick in Holtsville, New York. Kachmar's husband, John, was in attendance during the interview and occasionally interjects.</field>
