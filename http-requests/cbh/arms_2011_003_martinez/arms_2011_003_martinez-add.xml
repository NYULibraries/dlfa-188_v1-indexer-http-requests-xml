    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of two 14"x17" ink on paper drawings from pages 8 and 10 of Andrés Vera Martínez's work entitled Breuckelen 1679: Voyage to New Netherland, 2010.  Martínez created the work in connection with Brooklyn Historical Society's 2010 exhibition entitled "Artist and Artifact: Re|Visioning Brooklyn's Past," in which ten artists (seven visual artists, two writers, and one musician) were invited to create new artistic works inspired by existing items in Brookyn Historical Society's collections.  Martínez's contribution to the exhibition was inspired by Jasper Danckaerts' journal, which is a part of Brooklyn Historical Society's collections, and are rendered in a comic book or graphic novel format.  One drawing is composed of three frames depicting the arrival of Europeans at New Netherland on Friday, September 22, and the other drawing is composed of three frames depicting scenes relating to the sale of land from the Najack Indians to Jaques Cortelyou on Sunday, October 1.</field>
