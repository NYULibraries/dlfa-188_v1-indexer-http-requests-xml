    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The John Notman papers measure 3.72 linear feet and are housed in two full manuscript boxes, one half manuscript box, and two oversize boxes.  The collection spans the period 1849 to 1914 and consists of financial records, legal records, and correspondence covering the activities of the State Board of Charities, Notman's personal and business expenses, and the management of the estate of Notman's father, Peter, in which John and his brother, George Notman, were executors.  The collection also includes items relating to the merchant firm Howard, Sanger &amp; Co., owned and operated by Samuel E. Howard and Henry Sanger.  These items include stock transactions, contracts, and the wills of Howard and members of the Sanger family.  The nature of the connection between John Notman and Howard, Sanger &amp; Co. is unclear.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection has been arranged into three series:</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">John Notman was born on July 13, 1851 in Brooklyn, N.Y. to Peter Notman of Edinburgh, Scotland and Jane C. Dunlap of Chester County, PA.  Peter represented the Old Franklin Fire Insurance Company and served as a President of Niagara Fire Insurance Company.  John was named after his uncle, John Notman, a prominent architect.  He married Anna Warren Daniell in 1888 and had two daughters.  They lived at 149 Joralemon Street in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights.  Notman died on January 6, 1907.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Notman studied at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and graduated from Columbia Law School in 1872.  That year, he started his law career with the law firm of Barney, Butler &amp; Parsons, located at 54 Wall Street in Manhattan.  The firm underwent several name changes in the ensuing decades: in 1875, it became Butler, Stillman &amp; Hubbard, and when Notman became a partner in 1896, it became Butler, Notman, Joline &amp; Mynderse.  The firm's name changed again in 1905 to Butler, Notman &amp; Mynderse.  Notman specialized in contracts of indemnity and negligence law.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">When appointed as a Commissioner of the State Board of Charities in 1899, John Notman had already served on the Board's Committee on Orphan Asylums and the Deaf and the Hospital Committee for eight years.  He was a member of the Long Island Historical Society (later the Brooklyn Historical Society); the Hamilton, Metropolitan, and Lawyers' Clubs; and the New York State Bar Association.</field>
