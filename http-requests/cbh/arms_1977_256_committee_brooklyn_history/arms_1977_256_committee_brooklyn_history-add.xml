    <field name="abstract_teim">The Committee on Brooklyn History (originally named the Committee on Early Brooklyn History) was established in 1897 for the purpose of the collection, copying, translation, and preservation of documents, records, and any other materials relating to the early history of Brooklyn. Under the authorization of the Mayor of the City of Brooklyn, Frederick W. Wurster, the Committee on Brooklyn History was established under the supervision of the Long Island Historical Society (now Brooklyn Historical Society) and was chaired by Tunis G. Bergen. The Committee on Brooklyn History records span the years 1897 to 1920 (bulk dates 1897 to 1909) and measure 2.09 linear feet.

The correspondence documents the project, from its inception in 1897 to its stoppage following the consolidation of New York City to its restart under the mayorship of Seth Low and finally to its conclusion and beyond. The correspondence between Reid and Bergen sheds light on the historical documents Reid found relating to Brooklyn and where he found them.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Tunis G. Bergen (b. 1848) was a lawyer and civic leader. He served as the first Chairman of the Committee on Brooklyn History beginning in 1897.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sydney Reid (full name Sydney Robert Charles Forneri Reid) was a Canadian born printer, reporter, and writer. Born in Toronto on September 5, 1857, Reid began his career as a printer in Toronto from 1871 to 1880. In 1881, he moved to Brooklyn where he found work as a reporter, first at the Brooklyn Union-Argus (from 1883 to 1884) and then at the Brooklyn Eagle (1882 to 1890 and again from 1892 to 1895). While on staff at the Eagle, Reid wrote a series of articles on patient deaths that were the result of improper and negligent medical operations conducted at the Woman's Hospital of Brooklyn. Though the hospital sued Reid for libel, Reid won the case against him, proving his charges of malpractice against the hospital.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1895, Reid left the Brooklyn Eagle and became a freelance writer and researcher. In 1897, he was hired as a researcher by the Committee on Brooklyn History. Unfortunately, Reid's contract only lasted three months due to the impending consolidation of the City of Brooklyn into New York City. In 1903, Reid was rehired by the Committee to continue his research work locating materials documenting the early history of Brooklyn. Throughout his writing career, Reid continued to publish articles, essays, and poetry in various newspapers and periodicals including Harper's Weekly, Lippincott's, and the Independent. He also authored children's books and lectured on early Brooklyn and New York City history. Reid retired in the mid-1920s.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Upon moving to the United States, Reid resided in Brooklyn. In 1884, he married Josephine V. Armstrong (d. 1904) and they had five children: Sydney Jr. (b. 1885), Harry (b. 1887), Andrew (b. 1888), Josephine (b. 1892), and Robert (b. 1898). Following Josephine's death in 1904, Reid married Ella Elizabeth Egbert, and together they had one son, Roland (b. 1906).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Arthur James Weise (1838-1911) was a writer, historian, genealogist, and translator whose research and books focused primarily on New York State. Weise wrote extensively on the history of Troy, N.Y. and Albany, N.Y.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Committee on Brooklyn History (originally named the Committee on Early Brooklyn History) was established in 1897 for the purpose of locating, collecting, and preserving materials documenting early Brooklyn history. As provided for by Chapter 457 of the Laws of 1897 of the State of New York, the Mayor of the City of Brooklyn was "authorized and empowered, in his discretion, to make such provision as to him may seem proper for the collection, copying, translation, and preservation of documents, records, and any other materials relating to the history of Brooklyn." With the authorization of Mayor Frederick W. Wurster, the Committee on Brooklyn History was established under the supervision of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society). The Committee's original board members were Tunis G. Bergen (Chairman of the Committee), Wilhelmus Mynderse, John Jay Pierrepont, Alfred T. White, and James H. Bates.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The activities of Committee on Brooklyn History were financed through the revenue fund of the City of Brooklyn. In May of 1897, $30,000 was allocated to the project under the stipulation that no more than $6,000 could be spent per year. In October of 1897, the Committee hired Sydney Reid as researcher for the project. The scope of the project focused on the period from the first white settlement in Brooklyn (circa 1640) through the end of the American Revolutionary War (1783). Reid was hired for three months, with the terms of the contract ending on December 31, 1897. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">When the City of Brooklyn was consolidated into New York City in 1898, the project ceased due to lack of funding under Mayor Robert Anderson Van Wyck. In 1902, under the newly elected Mayor of New York City, Seth Low, funds were allocated for the project by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of the City of New York. On March 25, 1903 Reid was rehired to continue his work on the project. In July of 1904, the Committee also hired Arthur James Weise to locate, compile, and translate early Dutch manuscripts, documents, and rare books relating to the history of Brooklyn. Weise spent much of his time in the state archives located in Albany, N.Y. Weise continued to work on the project through 1910.</field>
