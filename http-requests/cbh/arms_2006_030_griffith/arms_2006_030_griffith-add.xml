Highlights of the collection include correspondence between William Patton Griffith and the general public, constituents, and political colleagues, such as letters to and from the office of Franklin Roosevelt, then Governor of New York. Among the notable items in this collection are a variety of speeches, clippings, programs, and certificates and other papers depicting Griffith's involvement in civic affairs such as the restoration of the General Slocum Statue in Brooklyn. In addition, there are some black and white photographs of Griffith attending a variety of public ceremonies and a few items representative of Griffith's personal life, such as poems, programs, certificates, and a swatch of flag bunting from the flag that flew over General Ulysses Grant's tomb in 1897. Some items of correspondence are photocopies of originals not in this collection. The collection has no materials reflecting Griffith's time as a Civil War soldier.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is organized thematically into the following seven categories: Correspondence, Writings, Personal Papers, Professional Papers, Photographs, Clippings, and Artifact (swatch of flag bunting).</field>
