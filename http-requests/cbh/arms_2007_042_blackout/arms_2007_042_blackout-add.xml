    <field name="scopecontent_teim">138 color 35mm slides depicting the aftermath of the 1977 blackout in Bushwick. These images were captured in the months after the July 13th Blackout of 1977. They were taken by two photographers and cover various locations in the neighborhood of Bushwick. They are predominately potographs of burned-out houses, apartments and stores. Some of the images show the fires being fought while others show the subsequent destruction or the reconstruction of the ruins.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The slides were taken on multiple dates by two unidentified photographers, one of whom may or may not be Ric Curtis, chair of the anthropology department at John Jay College. As a result, they are scattered around the neighborhood and occasionally feature the same location on a different date or from a different perspective. Some street signs are visible and other locations can be determined based on proximity to images in other slides or to prominent landmarks. The dates associated with the slides are determined by the development process, and not the capture of the image. There were at least three developments in July of 1977, at least two in August of 1977, one in June of 1978, and one more which is not dated. The slides, in all but the undated development, are successively numbered. The images predominately depict structures which suffered damage during the looting and fires which occurred during the blackout. Frequently there are groups of people within the scenes and occasionally these people are the focus. Item level description is available.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The blackout of 1977 led to looting and fires throughout New York City. The worst hit areas were in Brooklyn and the Bronx, and one of the most devastated was a thirty block stretch of Broadway in Bushwick. The damage here was particularly severe not only due to looting but also because of the comparatively high incidence of arson. Curvin and Porter state that "of the 134 stores looted in that section, 45, or 33 percent, were damaged by fire; many of these were burned to the ground." Despite this, the looters across New York City were relatively peaceable, showing little violence either towards the police or towards each other. Instead they worked together to reach their aims and even gave away their looted goods to those less fortunate. Their ability to decimate a street of businesses and escape with so many goods was aided by the slow pace of police response. At the start of the blackout, there were 189 officers on duty for the 1,000,000 residents of Brooklyn North (Williamsburg, Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Ocean Hill, Brownsville, Crown Heights, and East New York). Off-duty police had to come into the neighborhood from Queens, Staten Island, or even further afield. By the time they arrived and were in uniform and on the streets, the first and most serious wave of looting had already passed. The looting in Bushwick was also notable as it extended on into the day on the 14th, while most neighborhoods calmed with the coming of daylight. The fires also extended into the 14th, in fact growing worse on the second day. Curvin and Porter attribute this continuation to "the confusion of fire trucks and the darkness caused by the elevated tracks." These images were taken during the aftermath of the blackout, some showing firemen still fighting fires. Most showing the burned remains of stores and homes which were destroyed in the night and the slow process of rebuilding and recovering.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sister Elizabeth "Betty" Nickels was a Dominican nun in Bushwick, Brooklyn. In December 1981, she founded Independence House in Bushwick, a home for young women in need. In February 1983, she was honored by the Committee for New York City as a "New Yorker for New York" (New York Times, February 14, 1983).</field>
