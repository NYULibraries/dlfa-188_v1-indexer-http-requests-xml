    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes material from the research of Francis H. Touchet. The bulk of the series consists of newspaper clippings, and there is considerable overlap in content with that of the William Howard Melish clippings series. Nevertheless, Touchet's files include more material from earlier in the twentieth century, especially in relation to John Howard Melish and his writings. Touchet's files also emphasize the Melishes and their involvement in various matters, whereas the Melish clipping series often included articles concerning domestic and foreign matters that were of interest to Melish. Again, the Melishes' stance on United States-Soviet Union relations, Communism, and the ensuing controversy at Holy Trinity is the subject focus of the series.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The folder that covers the year 1955, which contains only a small number of clippings, includes a few programs from Holy Trinity, an issue of Parish News, and the minutes from a meeting of the vestry. The last folder of the series contains clippings, programs, and charts laid out for inclusion in the appendix of The Social Gospel and the Cold War: A History of the Melish Case, Touchet's doctoral thesis, as well as some handwritten notes. It also includes twentieth-century copies of records from the opening of the Church of the Holy Trinity in 1847, brochures from Brooklyn youth programs, architectural information, and other miscellaneous material concerning Holy Trinity. </field>
