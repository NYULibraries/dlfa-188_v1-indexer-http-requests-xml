    <field name="abstract_teim">The Arnie Goldwag Brooklyn Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) collection consists principally of the subject files concerning 1960s civil rights activism maintained by Arnie Goldwag, an officer of Brooklyn CORE during the first half of the 1960s. These files include correspondence, newsletters, event announcements (e.g., fliers), directions for demonstrators, photographs, press releases, clippings, and other documents related to many of the actions conducted by Brooklyn CORE, particularly for the period 1961-1965. Actions represented in the collection include those protesting discrimination in employment, housing, schools, and the like, including the controversial initiative to block traffic in connection with the opening of the 1964 World's Fair. The collection also includes reminiscences by Goldwag and other CORE members looking back from the 1990s and 2000s. In addition to Brooklyn CORE-related material, the collection includes material related to other 1960s activist groups, including those involved with civil rights, Vietnam War opposition, and draft resistance, among others.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Arnie Goldwag Brooklyn Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) collection consists principally of the subject files concerning 1960s civil rights activism maintained by Arnie Goldwag, an officer of Brooklyn CORE during the first half of the 1960s. These files include correspondence, newsletters, event announcements (e.g., fliers), directions for demonstrators, photographs, press releases, clippings, and other documents related to many of the actions conducted by Brooklyn CORE, particularly for the period 1961-1965. Actions represented in the collection include those protesting discrimination in employment, housing, local government services, schools, and the like. The collection includes actions, such as the Stall-In at the 1964 World's Fair, aimed at calling attention to discrimination practiced in Brooklyn and in the metropolitan New York City area, as well as participation in nationally-oriented initiatives, such as the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While the collection documents Brooklyn CORE's actions as an organization, it also documents the intersection of activism with the life of an important activist, Arnie Goldwag. The collection includes documentation of Goldwag's student years at Brooklyn College, his military draft status, arrest records, correspondence written to him while in Rikers Island prison, his reflections on his CORE activism, and other material. In addition, personal correspondence to Goldwag from other former CORE activists often include reflections on their activism.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection holds little or no material on CORE from the years after 1965, and little material generally from the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, the collection holds material from the 1980s-2000s that concern reunions, memorials, reminiscences, research papers, and other reflections on CORE, the civil rights struggle, and its continuing legacy. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to Brooklyn CORE, there is material in the collection from other national and New York organizations concerned with civil rights actions, including the Student NonViolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Harlem Parents Committee, among others. There is also material from the mid to late 1960s concerning anti-Vietnam War and anti-draft matters, including newsletters from the Brooklyn-based organizations End the Draft and Committee for Peace Organization. The collection also includes photocopies of New York City Police Department reports concerning the activities of CORE and other organizations from the 1960s and early 1970s. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Finally, the collection includes a selection of books and pamphlets from Arnie Goldwag's library and lapel pins and buttons from election campaigns, anti-war demonstrations, union activities, etc. collected by Goldwag.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Arnold (Arnie) Stanley Goldwag was born on January 18, 1938. A resident of Brooklyn, Goldwag attended Brooklyn College beginning in 1955 where he held leadership positions in a range of organizations, including social fraternities, student government, and student rights groups. He left Brooklyn College about 1961 without graduating, though he was readmitted in 1966 and graduated in 1968. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While still at Brooklyn College in the late 1950s, Goldwag became involved in the activities of the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), starting with distributing fliers urging a boycott of Woolworth's. His role in the chapter expanded quickly, and in the years of Goldwag's active participation in CORE (1960-1965), he held leadership positions, principally as the Community Relations Director. In this position, Goldwag was responsible for press relations, publicity, and coordination with communities and demonstrators on the organization's direct actions. Over the course of his tenure in Brooklyn CORE, Goldwag participated in a number of actions, both locally, such as the 1963 Board of Education sit-in, and nationally, such as in Cambridge, Maryland, where Goldwag was involved in CORE's effort to desegregate public facilities. Goldwag's activism led to several arrests and a 13 month prison sentence in 1964; he served one month of the sentence in Rikers Island penitentiary.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Founded in Chicago in 1942, CORE was centered on the principles of interracial, nonviolent direct action. Local chapters that affiliated with national CORE had a great deal of autonomy of action. Within this structure, Brooklyn CORE emerged in the early 1960s as one of the most radical CORE chapters, focusing on the living conditions of poor African-Americans in Bedford-Stuyvesant and employing increasingly aggressive confrontational tactics. It was during this surging radical activism in Brooklyn CORE that Goldwag was a central figure in the chapter and in its many civil rights actions. Indeed, Goldwag was a principal creator of one of Brooklyn CORE's most controversial actions, the Stall-In at the opening of the 1964 World's Fair. This action, which called for the deliberate blockage of automobile traffic headed to the Fair in order to call attention to discrimination against African-Americans, led to the suspension of the chapter by CORE. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Subsequent to his days with CORE, which ended in 1965, and his 1968 graduation from Brooklyn College, Goldwag went to work for the New York City Human Resources Administration as a contract manager for home care programs. In the 1990s he went on leave to work for his union (Social Service Employees Union Local 371) as Health and Safety Coordinator. In the 1990s and 2000s, Goldwag was actively engaged in ensuring that the civil rights movement was remembered, and its continued struggle recognized. He participated in a number of conferences and oral histories, and opened his files to researchers. Arnie Goldwag died on August 9, 2008.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The bulk of the collection was donated to the Brooklyn Historical Society in 2009 by Gilda Goldwag, the wife of the late Arnie Goldwag. A second donation of some additional correspondence was made by Ms. Goldwag in 2010.</field>
