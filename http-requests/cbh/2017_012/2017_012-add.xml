    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The legal materials provide insight into the transfer of land and legal process of land sales in Brooklyn in the mid to late 1860s. They also provide insight into the legal and institutional history of the Kings County Savings Institution. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Please note that the land is documented as the intersection of 4th Street and South 6th Street. However, while the street was historically called South 6th Street, today South 6th Street merges into Broadway. Additionally, what was historically a continuation of 4th Street is today Bedford Avenue. As a result, what would have historically been the intersection of 4th Street and South 6th Street is today the intersection of Broadway and Bedford Avenue. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The collection contains legal documents pertaining to land owned by the the Kings County Savings Institution at 135 Broadway. The Kings County Savings Institution was chartered in 1860, and construction began at 135 Broadway on the building that is now know as the Kings County Savings Bank the same year. Upon completion in 1867, the building was continuously operated by the Kings County Savings Institution until it went through several mergers in the 1980s, and was ultimately sold by North Side Savings Bank in the 1990s. The donor, Alissa Ballot, was the General Counsel to the North Side Savings Bank at the time of the sale of 135 Broadway, and was permitted to keep the Kings County Savings Institution documents.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The documents, as well as copies made later, were donated by Alissa Ballot in 2017.</field>
