    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brooklyn YMCA Central Branch publications document the activities of the Central Branch during the period 1884 to 1967.  Materials in the collection include copies of the Central Branch's news bulletin, Brooklyn Central (later Brooklyn Central News), as well as additional ephemeral literature.  The news bulletins constitute the bulk of the collection and date from 1916 to 1967, with a gap between the years 1920 and 1928.  The bulletins dating from 1916 to 1920 are compiled in three bound volumes, while the remaining bulletins are included individually.  Items contained in the bulletins include historical sketches, articles and reports on the Central Branch's activities, opinion columns, schedules of events and programs, and local and national news.  Additional items include a souvenir prospectus commemorating the construction of the Central Branch's new building in 1915, a booklet titled "On Duty in War and Peace" published in 1917, a booklet titled "The Story of the Central Branch 1916-1917", and two promotional brochures from the 1960s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains two items representing the general Brooklyn YMCA and its Eastern District Branch.  These include an 1884 pamphlet containing the Brooklyn YMCA's constitution and bylaws, and a pamphlet released by the Eastern District Branch to solicit funds for the construction of its new building, dated 1912.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) was founded in London in 1844 as a haven where young men could escape the dangers of urban life and engage in Bible study and prayer.  The YMCA's influence quickly spread to the United States, with Associations being established in the country's major cities as early as 1851.  As the YMCA evolved, its activities expanded to include recreational programs, educational instruction, and community service.  By the 20th century, the YMCA had transformed from a primarily religious organization into a major social institution.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Brooklyn's YMCA was founded in 1853.  Its first permanent edifice, comprised of three buildings on Fulton, Bond, and Hanover Streets, opened in 1885 and housed the newly formed Central Branch, commonly referred to as Brooklyn Central.  At the time, the buildings were the most well-equipped YMCA facilities in the country.  By 1898, the Brooklyn YMCA had established seven branches aside from the Central Branch, including the Eastern District, Bedford, Twenty-Sixth Ward, Prospect Park, Long Island Medical College, Greenpoint, and German Branches.  The Brooklyn YMCA continued to expand throughout the 20th century, and in 1924 it was renamed the Brooklyn and Queens Young Men's Christian Association to reflect its activity in the borough of Queens.  Later in 1957, the Brooklyn and Queens YMCA became part of the YMCA of Greater New York.  As of 2011, the YMCA of Greater New York continues to serve the New York City community, with eight locations in the borough of Brooklyn.</field>
