    <field name="bioghist_teim">Nathaniel Matson (1839-1916) was the son of Stephen Johnson and Esther Van Bergen Matson and the grandson of Israel Matson. He was born March 6, 1839 in Schodack Landing, NY. He was educated at Schodack Academy and Kinderhook Academy in New York and Williston Seminary in Easthampton, MA. He began his medical studies in St. Augustine, FL in 1860 under Dr. John Peck and continued in New York with Drs. Fradenbergh and Mosher before attending the University Medical College in New York City, from which institution he graduated in 1864.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After graduating, Dr. Matson joined the Union army as assistant surgeon of the First Connecticut Heavy Artillery and served until the unit disbanded in September 1865. He was also acting brigade surgeon in charge of the hospital at Alexandria during the summer of 1865. Starting in May 1866, Dr. Matson began practicing medicine in Brooklyn, NY, focusing on obstetrics. He was a member of the Brooklyn Medical Society, the Kings County Medical Society, and the Physicians' Mutual Aid Association. He was also a veteran Master Mason and a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and the Invincible Club. In 1872, he began serving as medical examiner for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. He also received the commission of brevet captain for meritorious services in front of St. Petersburg, VA.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1872, Matson married Anna Elizabeth Glover, daughter of John I. Glover and granddaughter of Frederick Glover. They had four children: Esther Mary, Clarine Van Bergen (married Gregory B. Webb, 1919), Anna Nathalie and Irving Glover, the last of whom died in infancy. The family lived at 415 Greene Avenue in Brooklyn. Dr. Matson passed away in 1916 and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Frederick Glover (1799-1863) was born in Brooklyn, son of Joseph Glover and Elizabeth Conklin. He married Susan Terry, daughter of Joseph and Anna Terry, in 1825. They had five children: John Irwin (b. 1828), Joseph Terry (1832-1886), George Frederick (b. 1834), Elizabeth (1838-1840) and Eugene (died in infancy). Glover was a master builder and many of the private homes, churches, and public buildings in Brooklyn were his work. His son John joined him in that business, and together they built the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library, City Hospital, Old Ladies' Home and the Sailors' Home at Snug Harbor on Staten Island, as well as multiple buildings by Augustus and John B. Graham.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1802 Viscount John Thomas Netterville traveled from Ireland to the United States. He decided to settle in the U.S. and sent for his wife, Ann Whitely, and two sons, Thomas and John. Three more children--Mary, Jane, and William--were born in the United States. Thomas, the eldest, was sent to college and inherited the family property. Upon learning that they would receive no inheritance and were expected to become farmers, William ran away, while John, with the financial assistance of his mother, became a cabinet maker's apprentice in Albany and eventually a talented woodworker in his own right. John's grandson, also named John, eventually lived in Saugerties where his daughter, Elizabeth, married the mayor's son, William Ziegler, who then himself became mayor. They had three daughters: Helen, Amy, and Betsy.</field>
