    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Feast of the Giglio (sometimes referred to as the Feast of St. Paulinus or San Paolino) is an annual Catholic celebration held by Italian Americans in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. In 1903, the first annual Feast of the Giglio was celebrated in the streets of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. On feast day, or Giglio Sunday (held in July), celebrants proceed through the streets following the Giglio tower. The tower, weighing over three tons and measuring 65 feet in height, consists of six panels made of papier mache that are decorated with depictions of saints, angels, flowers, and a map of Italy. The tower is anchored to a platform (large enough to hold a band and a singer) that is attached to metal poles. The whole structure is lifted by its poles and is carried through the streets by over 100 lifters (called paranza). The procession is headed by the Capo Paranza (head lifter) who plays an integral part in the day's activities. The band and singer perform the official Giglio song called "O' Giglio e Paradiso." The procession also includes a boat (La Barca) that holds another band and singer, as well as several men and children dressed in North African dress depicting the story of St. Paulinus's captivity and his gaining of freedom for himself and other Nola citizens enslaved in North Africa in the 5th century. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The immigrants who celebrated the first annual Feast of the Giglio predominantly came from the city of Nola, located in the Campania region of southern Italy, where the feast originates. St. Paulinus (or San Paolino in Italy) is the patron saint of Nola and the giglio (lily) refers to the lilies that were brought to St. Paulinus upon his return to Nola with the citizens of the city whom he helped to free. As of 2011, the feast is still being held at the same location in Williamsburg, centered near Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church.</field>
