    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Photographs of St. Mary's Maternity Hospital contains 25 black-and-white 8 x 10 inch photographic prints showing exterior, interior, and detail views of St. Mary's Maternity Hospital taken on November 6, 1991. The hospital was located on Dean Street and bounded by Hoyt, Pacific, and Bond Streets in the Boerum Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. Also included in the collection is a photocopy of a site plan of the block the hospital was located, as well as the locations from which each photograph was taken. The photographs were either taken by or managed by architect Joseph V. Marino for a project approved by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">St. Mary's Maternity Hospital was originally established as St. Mary's Female Hospital in Brooklyn in 1868 by the Sisters of Charity, a Roman Catholic congregation of women. In 1888, the hospital was reincorporated as St. Mary's Maternity and Infant Home. The hospital was founded to help needy women and it specialized in treating female-specific diseases, as well as provided a maternity, a nursery, and a dispensary for men, women, and children. The five-story red brick building was located on Dean Street and was bounded by Hoyt, Pacific, and Bond Streets in the Boerum Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 1937, Holy Family Hospital was constructed adjacent to St. Mary's. Also located on the site was a one-story laundry facility and a one-story boiler plant. The St. Mary's Maternity Hospital building was demolished sometime after November 6, 1991.</field>
