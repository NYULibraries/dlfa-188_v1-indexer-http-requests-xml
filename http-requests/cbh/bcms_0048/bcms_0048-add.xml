    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jesús Colón (sometimes spelled Jesus Colon) was born in 1901 in Cayey, Puerto Rico to a working class family. As a teenager he moved to San Juan, where he joined the city's new Socialist Party and took on leadership roles in his high school's journal and literary society. At sixteen he moved in Brooklyn, arriving aboard the S.S. Carolina to live with his older brother, Joaquin.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> Colón faced difficulty finding employment in New York, working a number of odd jobs including dockworker and dishwasher. He earned his high school degree by attending night classes at Boys High School and took college courses at St. John's University. During this time he became active in the New York Socialist Party, becoming a founding member of the Party's Puerto Rican Committee.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> By the late 1920s Colón was a regular contributor to various newspapers in both New York and Puerto Rico, occasionally writing under the pseudonyms Miquis Tiquis and Pericles Espada. Over the next decades he contributed articles and columns to papers such as Liberación, Vida Obrera, Gráfico, and La Tribuna. By 1955 he was also contributing regular columns to the Communist publications Daily Worker and the Daily World.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> In addition to opinion and news he also wrote poetry and short stories. His most recognized work, "A Puerto Rican in New York and Other Sketches" was published by Mainstream Publishers in 1961. The book is an autobiographical collection of short stories documenting his experience and observations as a Puerto Rican immigrant in New York. It's recognized as one of the first English language books about the Puerto Rican experience by a Puerto Rican author.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> Colón also worked as a political activist and labor organizer. He co-founded organizations such as La Liga Puertorriqueña e Hispana and Alianza Obrera Puertorriqueña and served as head of the Spanish speaking lodges of the International Workers Order. Colón ran for office several times, for assemblyman and for city council under the American Labor Party, and in 1969 for city comptroller under the Communist Party. Colón died in May 1974 in New York City.</field>
