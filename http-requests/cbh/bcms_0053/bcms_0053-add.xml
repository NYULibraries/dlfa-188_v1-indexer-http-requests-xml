A former VISTA Volunteer, and participant in NYC's Cultural Council Foundation's CETA Artists Project, Racioppo had his first solo exhibit in 1977 at Brooklyn's f-stop Gallery.

After receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship in Photography in 1997, Racioppo took a leave from HPD to work on a series of personal projects, including FORGOTTEN GATEWAY, the Abandoned Buildings of Ellis Island, a travelling exhibit of his photographs that originated at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C.</field>
