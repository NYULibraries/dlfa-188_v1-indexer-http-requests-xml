    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The autograph books primarily contain inscriptions from school friends, family, and sometimes simply a name and a date. As such, the autograph books frequently focus on school graduations and friendships formed during school. For instance, the autograph book of Miriam Miller contains a list of her fellow graduates at Bushwick High School and who was on the honor roll. Additionally the Edna West, Sue Gilmore, Frank Pergolizzi, and an unidentified autograph book contain inscriptions from friends and family.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While autograph books were popular in the 19th century, they were gradually phased out in favor of school yearbooks in the mid to late 20th century. This collection does not include autograph books focused on collecting the signatures of famous individuals.</field>
