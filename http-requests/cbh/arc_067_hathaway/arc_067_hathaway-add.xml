    <field name="abstract_teim">Paul Hathaway McGinnis was born August 27, 1935, and was the adopted son of Arthur Walton McGinnis (1894-1977) and Mildred (Fowler) McGinnis (1903-1959).  He grew up in Queens Village, N.Y., and attended the First United Presbyterian Church.  He graduated from St. Paul's School in Garden City, N.Y. in June of 1954, and subsequently attended Hofstra College, from which he graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.  He received his Master of Arts degree from Adelphi University in 1968.  The Paul Hathaway McGinnis family papers mainly document McGinnis's early life, though there are also several materials pertaining to his parents and extended family (presumably exclusive to his mother's side), and a small number of items concerning McGinnis in later life.  Materials span the period 1897 to 1986 and include correspondence; greeting cards; diaries; autograph albums; marriage announcements, books, and certificates; birth and death certificates; graduation commencement programs; sales documents; photographs; and miscellaneous family papers.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Paul Hathaway McGinnis family papers mainly document McGinnis's early life, though there are also several materials pertaining to his parents and extended family (presumably exclusive to his mother's side), and a small number of items concerning McGinnis in later life.  Materials span the period 1897 to 1986 and include correspondence; greeting cards; diaries; autograph albums; marriage announcements, marriage service books, bridal books, and marriage certificates; birth and death certificates; items pertaining to McGinnis's education at St. Paul's School, Hofstra College, and Adelphi University, including recommendation letters and graduation commencement programs; items pertaining to the death and burial of McGinnis's aunt, Ada Dayton; and sales documents, some of which concern the finances of Ada Dayton and the sale of McGinnis's property in Oyster Bay, Long Island.  Other family papers illuminate the lives of McGinnis's relatives, including newspaper clippings regarding his grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary, his grandfather's discharge papers from the 47th Regiment of the New York Infantry, a certificate issued to his grandmother from the Board of Education of the City of New York, a booklet on military maneuvering that belonged to his father as a child, the commencement program for his mother's graduation from Public School 99, his mother's calling cards, and other items.  Graphic materials include a picture postcard of Charles Lindbergh, and several photographs, the majority of which show McGinnis in his infancy and childhood.  Some of these photos are oversized and are separately housed in an oversize photograph box.  A small number of additional photographs relate to Ms. Walberger Metzger and fashion model Marie Beckman Randall.  One daguerreotype photograph of Ms. Metzger is separately housed in the daguerreotype collection.  McGinnis's connection to Beckman and Metzger is not made clear by the items in this collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Paul Hathaway McGinnis was born August 27th, 1935, and was the adopted son of Arthur Walton McGinnis (1894-1977) and Mildred (Fowler) McGinnis (1903-1959).  He grew up in Queens Village, N.Y., and attended the First United Presbyterian Church.  He graduated from St. Paul's School in Garden City, N.Y. in June of 1954, and subsequently attended Hofstra College, from which he graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.  McGinnis lived in Westbury after graduating from Hofstra, and he later pursued graduate studies at Adelphi University, from which he received a Master of Arts degree in 1968.  Details regarding McGinnis's subsequent professional life are unknown, though it is documented that he lived in Oyster Bay, N.Y., and later relocated to Case Mesa, CA.  It is not known if he ever married.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Several materials in the collection give evidence that McGinnis was close to his parents and extended family on his mother's side, including his grandparents, George Samuel Fowler, Jr. and Ada (Earle) Fowler (1875-1938), who resided in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush; his uncle, George Fowler (b. 1905); and his aunt, Ada (Fowler) Dayton (1909-1985).  Items in the collection attest that McGinnis took on responsibility for the care of his Aunt Ada in her later life, taking her into his home in Case Mesa.</field>
