    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of this collection is dated 1950-1970 and focuses on the successful bid to make the neighborhood a historic landmark. It includes extensive correspondence with mayors, borough presidents, and agency heads. Records also cover such topics as air pollution, tree planting, noise pollution, Brooklyn Union Gas, and Burger King. Meeting minutes, reports, and documents from various lawsuits brought by the Brooklyn Heights Association also make up a large portion of the subject files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Another significant portion of the subject files is the Brooklyn Heights Association Piers files, dating from 1986-1989. These files represent the successful attempt by the Association to set guidelines for the redevelopment of the docks and piers under and around the Brooklyn Promenade and the Brooklyn Bridge before the creation of the Brooklyn Bridge Park.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> The Brooklyn Heights Association retained extensive records on the Civilian Observation Patrol or C.O.P. program. Documents include safety reports, patrol reports, correspondence, grant applications, patrol logs, reports, and surveys.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Two other areas of significance are the records of the Roebling Project and the financial records from 1924-1982. The Roebling project includes grant applications and fundraising efforts, artist submissions, renderings and correspondence. This project was the Association's attempt to honor Brooklyn Bridge architect John A. Roebling with a statue. The financial records include expenditures, revenue, and cash receipts. The financial records detail financial ties with members and organizations as well as salary payouts.</field>
