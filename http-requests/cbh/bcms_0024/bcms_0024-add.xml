    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Carlisle Club was founded in 1931 in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. The club promoted social and athletic activities in the area but also aimed to educate its members and raise their cultural awareness. As part of this, the group promoted anti-war beliefs and held peace rallies, until the attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in many of the club's members joining the war effort.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> The Carlisle Indian is the Club's newsletter, edited by member Eli Drapkin (1918-2006) while he was stationed at Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Later issues were edited by Eli's wife Ruth. Some of the copies in this collection may have been owned by the Drapkins, since they include a mock-up of one issue, duplicate copies of several issues, and copies with handwritten corrections.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> The newsletter is organized into several recurring columns and also includes information on Carlisle Club activities. The column "Letter of the Month" began in early 1943 and includes highly descriptive correspondence from club members serving overseas.</field>
