    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The scrapbook documents the founding years of the Brooklyn Women's Dumb Animal Aid Association, an organization founded by women to provide aid to animals in need, as well as to support the prevention of cruelty to animals. The scrapbook, dating from 1893 to 1903, includes the organization's printed bylaws, related news clippings, and ephemera created by the organization. The bylaws include the names of the organization's officers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was founded in New York City in 1866 by Henry Bergh (circa 1811-1888). Several days after the first animal welfare act was passed in the New York state legislature in April of 1866, Bergh set out on the streets of New York City to enforce the newly enacted law. Under the law, acts of cruelty to animals, such as beating a horse or dog fighting, needed to be observed by a bystander in order to be prosecuted; the ASPCA was granted the right of enforcement. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1868, the first Brooklyn branch of the ASPCA was organized. In 1881, the branch was permanently established in Brooklyn and the organization changed its name to The Brooklyn Agency for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Its office was located at 415 Fulton Street in what is today the neighborhood of Downtown Brooklyn. The Agency continued the work of the Manhattan-based office, which included enforcing anti-cruelty laws, as well as running animal shelters in Brooklyn. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Following the establishment of the Brooklyn Agency of the ASPCA, other animal welfare organizations were established in Brooklyn including the Brooklyn Women's Dumb Animal Aid Association. Founded in February of 1893, the organization's mission was to encourage and foster humane treatment of animals, to raise funds to support this mission, and to help to secure a permanent building for the ASPCA in Brooklyn.</field>
