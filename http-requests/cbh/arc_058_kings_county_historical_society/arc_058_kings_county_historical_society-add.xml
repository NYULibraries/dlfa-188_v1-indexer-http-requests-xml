    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Kings County Historical Society was founded in 1911 and incorporated in 1913. 
Its objectives included the dissemination of knowledge of the early history of Kings County through lectures and publications, the promotion of historic research, the collection of items of historic interest, the creation of historic place markers, and the acquisition of historic sites.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Admission into the Society required applicants to detail their genealogy and personal ties to Brooklyn. Officers of the Society included such prominent Brooklyn residents as Charles Ditmas, Frederick Van Wyck, George Tiffany, and John Van Siclen. Active until the late 1930s, the Society's board voted to dissolve in 1941. The Long Island Historical Society (now Brooklyn Historical Society) received the organization's records and collections in 1947.</field>
