    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Flatbush Taxpayers' Association, formerly the 29th Ward Taxpayers' Association, was a citizens association organized February 13, 1896 for the purpose of advocating for civic improvements within Flatbush. Some of the issues the association advocated for included improving transit facilities in Flatbush, fighting against the building of an elevated rail system in Flatbush, inspecting all tax assessments in Flatbush, and improving or securing sewer systems, fire and police protection, telephone and telegraph service, and street improvements, among others. Any taxpayer within Flatbush could apply for membership.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The association met on the first Thursday of every month (except for the months of July and August) at Flatbush Avenue and Lenox Road in Brooklyn. Examples of the association's committees during the years 1908 to 1911 included an executive committee, railroads and transportation committee, schools and libraries committee, reception and members committee, telephone and telegraph committee, health and sanitation committee, street lights and sewers committee, police and fire protection committee, taxes and assessments committee, program and speakers committee, and tunnels and bridges committee.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Flatbush, located in central Brooklyn, was one of the original six towns of Brooklyn. First settled by the Dutch in the 1630s, Flatbush was granted a patent of township by Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1652. Flatbush came under British rule when the British invaded New Amsterdam (now New York City) in 1664. During the 1670s, Flatbush fell back under Dutch control for a short time before returning again to British rule. The Town of Flatbush was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894 and the City of Brooklyn was then incorporated into New York City in 1898. For most of its history, Flatbush was a rural community, populated with farms. Today, Flatbush is a neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn and is comprised of numerous smaller neighborhoods including Midwood, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace, Beverly Square (East and West), Prospect Park South, Caton Park, and Albemarle-Kenmore Terraces.</field>
