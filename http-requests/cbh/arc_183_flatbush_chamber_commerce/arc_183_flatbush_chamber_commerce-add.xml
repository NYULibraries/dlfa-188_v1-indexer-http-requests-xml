    <field name="bioghist_teim">The present-day neighborhood of Flatbush, located in central Brooklyn, was one of the original six towns of Brooklyn. First settled by the Dutch in the 1630s, Vlackebos (sometimes spelled Vlacke Bos) and Midwout, as the Dutch alternatively called it, was granted a patent of township by Governor Peter Stuyvesant in 1652. After Flatbush came under British rule in 1664 when the British invaded New Amsterdam (now New York City), the names Vlackebos and Midwout were anglicized to Flatbush and Midwood. During the 1670s, Flatbush fell back under Dutch control for a short time before returning again to British rule. Further, land disputes between both the neighboring town of New Amersfoort, as well as with the Rockaway Indians, also occurred at this time until the return of British rule permanently settled the disputes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">For most of its history, Flatbush was a rural community, populated with farms. When the construction of the Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railroad was completed in 1878, the transformation from a rural community to a popular inner suburb began. The annexation of the Town of Flatbush by the City of Brooklyn in 1894, followed by the opening of the Brighton Beach subway line in 1920, led to further development--including both single and double family homes, as well as large apartment buildings--and drew an increasingly diverse population. Today, Flatbush is comprised of numerous smaller neighborhoods including Midwood, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace, Beverly Square (East and West), Prospect Park South, Caton Park, and Albemarle-Kenmore Terraces.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Flatbush Chamber of Commerce was organized in 1915 for the purpose of promoting local business, securing better infrastructure, and influencing community planning for the betterment of the community of Flatbush. It was a member of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America and its office was located at 887 Flatbush Avenue.</field>
