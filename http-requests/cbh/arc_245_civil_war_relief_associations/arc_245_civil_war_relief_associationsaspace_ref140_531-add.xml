    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains a wide variety of materials principally concerning the Civil War or from the Civil War era. A small number of documents date from prior to the Civil War. It might be that some of the items were exhibited at the Brooklyn and Long Island Fair, but this is unknown. Civil War-related materials include poems; a manuscript by Capt. Samuel Whiting read to the Long Island Historical Society describing his experiences at Fort Sumter in 1861 and as U.S. Consul to the Bahamas afterward; printed remarks at the presentation of a flag to the 26th Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops (raised in New York by the Union League Club); a printed solicitation by Edward Everett on behalf of Lieut. Worden of the ship "Monitor"; a sheet of tax notes from the city of Charleston, S.C.; Confederate regiment documents such as pay accounts and quartermaster requisitions; and several other documents.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Documents dating from the Civil War era include materials relating to the 1864 Presidential campaign, including the first number of The World, a newspaper supporting McClellan, covering the Democratic National Convention; orders and other documents concerning two New York State National Guard regiments, the 13th and the 26th (these documents do not relate to the regiments' service in the war); proposed alphabets for the blind (with raised lettering); commercial advertisements; and some items printed in response to Lincoln's assassination. The advertisements include two broadsheets, one documenting 1864 financial and other data for all fire insurance companies doing business in New York State and the second soliciting the general public to purchase tax-exempt U.S. government bonds. A Bradstreet's Commercial Reports circa 1865 for the New England states and eastern Canada is in the series, used in part as a scrapbook for poems. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some of the material throughout the series relates to local Brooklyn or New York organizations, such as the articles of association for the Sewing Society of the Summerfield Methodist Episcopal Church in Brooklyn. These local connections are highlighted with notes in the container list below.</field>
