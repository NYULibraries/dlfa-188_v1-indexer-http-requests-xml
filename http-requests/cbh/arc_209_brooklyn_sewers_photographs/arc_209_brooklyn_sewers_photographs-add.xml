    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some of the images from  the glass plate negatives are also included in the photograph album. Notes in the photograph album, when included, identify the people, location, and machinery in the photographs. They also help to identify people and locations in some of the glass plate negatives.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the mid-19th century, the City of Brooklyn made a serious effort to tackle its sewage and waste problems. As with the rest of the United States, Brooklyn (as did Manhattan) lacked underground sewage systems. With the outbreak of cholera and other infectious diseases circa 1830, combined with an ever-rising population, the City of Brooklyn established a Board of Sewer Commissioners in 1857 to deal with its formidable sewage disposal problems. Still, sewage disposal consisted mostly of drainage, and it wasn't until the last quarter of the 19th century that the construction of underground sewage systems began in Brooklyn.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The glass plate negatives were a gift of the Bronx Historical Society, 1988. The photograph album was purchased by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society), 1986.</field>
