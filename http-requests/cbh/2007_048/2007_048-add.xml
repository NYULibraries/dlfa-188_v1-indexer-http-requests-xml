    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The  Lee Bergeson collection of Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge photographs are comprised of six albums dating from circa 1959 to 1963 and including 42 images of the bridge under construction. Some of these images are accompanied by descriptive captions and other contextual materials, particular in the first album, which contains a list of Staten Island population numbers over the years and a fact sheet on United States Steel letterhead, among other items. All of the images are black-and-white. The photographers are unidentified, but the albums themselves were created by John Pollock.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects Staten Island and Brooklyn. Prior to the building of this bridge, Staten Island's only connection with New York were ferries, which were subject to overcrowding and long wait times for drivers. Construction on the bridge began in 1959 and was completed in 1964. With a total suspended length of 7,400 feet and a mainspan of 4,260 feet, the Verrazzano-Narrows bridge was at the time of its dedication the longest suspension bridge in the world. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The bridge is named after Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, but this name was mispelled in the original dedication of the bridge with only one z: the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The spelling was not officially corrected until 2018. It is commonly referred to as simply the Verrazzano Bridge.</field>
