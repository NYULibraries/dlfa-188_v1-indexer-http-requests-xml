    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is primarily composed of papers which belonged to Eugene G. Blackford, specifically regarding two organizations: the Mariners' and Wanderers' Aid Society and the Ichthyophagous Club. The papers were collected by David C. Garre.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Blackford served as Secretary to the Mariners' and Wanderers' Aid Society. Items related to this organization include reports, meeting minutes, the Society's constitution and by-laws, and clippings, dating from 1866 to 1867.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Blackford was also a member and Treasurer of the Ichthyophagus Club, a Manhattan-based dining club, and his papers relating to this organization include dinner invitations and menus, dating from 1880 to 1887. The dinners were held at various locations in Manhattan, Coney Island, Long Island, and New Jersey. The Ichthyophagus Club menus feature fantastical illustrations of sea life.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains three items related to David C. Garre's ancestors: a photograph of his aunt, Margaret R. (Gray) Garre, circa 1930s; a photograph of four unidentified persons, circa 1930s; and a thank-you card sent from Mrs. William McKinley (Ida Saxton McKinley) to Margaret R. Gray, 1901.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Ichthyophagous Club was a dinner club which was established in the City of New York in 1880. The group organized dinners which featured seafood which was not typically prepared for 19th century meals, such as shark, octopus, skate, and other sea animals. Dinners were held at several locations between 1880 and 1887, including the Murray Hill Hotel, J.H. Starin's Glen Island, Havermeyer's Point, the Hotel Brighton, the Manhattan Beach Hotel, the Hotel Buckingham, and the Palisade Mountain House.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Mariners' Guide and Wanderers' Aid Society of the City of New York was organized by members of the First Baptist Mariners' Church, along with other Manhattan and Brooklyn based Baptist church members, in 1866. According to the preamble of the organization's constitution and by-laws, the group was formed, "for the purpose of guarding and protecting the mariners who enter the port of New York and giving comfort to the desponding wanderers." The group operated mission rooms at the Mariners' Temple, located at Oliver Street and Henry Street, in Manhattan. Members conducted missionary visits to ships, distributed bibles, and offered religious services to sailors and other travelers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Eugene G. Blackford was born in Morristown, New Jersey, on August 8, 1839. He was raised in Brooklyn, New York, and would later establish himself as a prominent businessman and naturalist. He was the president of the Brooklyn Bank, trustee of the People's Trust Company, and director of the Hide and Leather Bank in New York. From 1879 to 1892, he was Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries of the State of New York. He published numerous scientific papers on fish and fisheries during this time. He was also a charter member of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and helped establish the biological laboratories at Cold Spring Harbor, New York. Blackford died on December 29, 1904, and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery.</field>
