    <field name="abstract_teim">The Martense family papers include deeds, indentures, wills, estate administration documents, promissory notes, bills of sale for enslaved African-Americans, correspondence, and photographs and other images. The bulk of the documents date from the 1700s to circa 1876. The images date from circa 1870 to circa 1944. Deeds and other land transaction documents dating from the 1700s comprise the largest portion of the collection. The Martense family lived in Flatbush, now part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, and most of the collection concerns that area. Correspondence in the collection dates from 1837-1839 and includes several letters sent to Gerrit Martense at Rutgers College in New Brunswick, N.J., by his family in Flatbush. Subjects of the letters include domestic and local matters. The letters, and other documents in the collection, also refer to dealings concerning one Juan Scorsur, an Italian immigrant to New York attempting to acquire real estate in Brooklyn while residing for an extended time in Cuba. In addition to multiple generations of Martenses, among the surnames found in the collection are Cornell, Hegeman, Lefferts, Remsen, Suydam, Terhune, Van Brunt, Van der Bilt, Van der Veer, and Waldron. The bulk of the collection is in English, but there are several documents in Dutch and one in Spanish. BHS has transcriptions and English translations of documents originally written in Dutch. The photographs and other images, to the extent they are identified, are principally of members of the Wilbur family, into which a Martense married.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Martense family papers include deeds, indentures, wills, estate administration documents, bills of sale for enslaved African Americans, correspondence, and photographs and other images. The bulk of the documents date from the 1700s to about 1876. Most of the images date from the twentieth century, though some likely date to about the 1870s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Land transaction documents (1722-1833) comprise the largest portion of the collection. Most of these date from the 1700s and concern property in Flatbush, now part of the borough of Brooklyn, New York City. Brooklyn, Flatlands, and New Jersey are also represented in the land transactions. In addition to Martense, among the surnames found in the deeds are Cornell, Hegeman, Lefferts, Remsen, Suydam, Terhune, Van Brunt, Van der Bilt, Van der Veer, and Waldron. A small number of promissory notes (1728-1745, 1850) are also in the collection. A few wills and estate administration documents (1731-1876) concerning the Martense, Lefferts, and Cortelyou families are in the collection. There are several documents in Dutch, dating from 1675-1748; these appear to be legal transactions. Brooklyn Historical Society has transcriptions and English translations of the documents in Dutch. There are eight enslaved people bills of sale (1753-1812), principally concerning Flatbush families. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence in the collection dates from 1837-1839. It includes several letters sent to Gerrit Martense at Rutgers College in New Brunswick, N.J. by his family in Flatbush. Subjects of the letter include family health, neighborhood occurrences, local weddings and deaths, comments on local politics, finances, intended visits, and other familial matters. Two letters discuss a theft by an African American, his arrest and multiple escapes. The letters, and other documents in the collection, also refer to dealings concerning one Juan Scorsur, an Italian immigrant to New York attempting to acquire real estate in Brooklyn while residing for an extended time on business in Cuba. One of the Scorsur documents is in Spanish. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among the miscellaneous documents are a power of attorney from the trustees of Erasmus Hall to Gerrit L. Martense (1818); receipts (1708-1828); and a warrant to Flatbush tax assessors (1717).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs and other images (circa 1870 to circa 1944), to the extent they are identified, are principally of members of the Wilbur family, including Anna Martense Wilbur, Jane V. Martense Wilbur, and Martense Wilbur. There are two cartes-de-visite and two cabinet cards among the formats. Most of the images are of women.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Martense family was among the early settlers of Flatbush, in what is now the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. They were descendants of Marten Adrianse (or Adriaence) (1668-1754), the second son of Adrian Ryerson.  Just as Marten was known as Adrianse (child of Adrian) from his father's name, similarly, in the next generation, Marten's second son took the name Gerrit Martense (1697-1732). Subsequent generations of sons into the early 1800s retained the surname Martense, though with some variant spellings, and the first names Gerrit and Leffert appear often in this family line. Their wives came from the families Vanderbilt, Suydam, Cortelyou, Vanderveer, and Ditmas. Gerrit Martense (1823-1849) and Jane A. Ditmas had a daughter, Jane V. Martense (1846-1912), who married Lionel Wilbur (d. 1880?). Their daughter, Anna M. Wilbur (d. 1930) came into possession of these papers. (From genealogy note by Dorothy Truman (see first folder of collection) and The Ryerson Genealogy by Albert Winslow Ryerson, on the BHS library shelves at call number CS71.R947.1916.)</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The collection was donated to the Brooklyn Historical Society in 1994 by Mrs. Isabel Woonton of Ontario, Canada. The collection had been in the possession of Mrs. Wooton's aunt, Miss Jane McKee, who was the friend and companion of Miss Anna Martense Wilbur, a descendant of the Martense family. Miss Wilbur died in 1930. After Miss McKee died in 1973 the collection went to her niece, Mrs. Merle McKillop and, at her death, to another niece, Mrs. Woonton. After unsuccessful attempts to pass the papers on to Miss Wilbur's remaining relations, Mrs Woonton gave the collection to Mrs. Dorothy P. Truman of Morristown, N.J., for an appropriate disposition. Mrs. Truman identified Brooklyn Historical Society for the donation.</field>
