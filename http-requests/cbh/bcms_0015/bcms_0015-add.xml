    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The first series of the Ina Clausen Papers collection contains personal records from Clausen's early life in Brooklyn, NY, including school report cards, church certificates, family photographs, and publications Clausen contributed to at her high school, Prospect Heights High School. The second series consists of an assortment of flyers, greeting cards, raffle tickets and invitations produced by the Greenpoint Print Shop, of which Clausen was a founding member.

The third series is comprised of Feminist journals Clausen contributed to, as well as rough drafts of an article Clausen published in the journal Up from Under.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ina Clausen was born February 21, 1943 to Einar Clausen and Linda Hansen Clausen in Brooklyn, NY. She attended the Prospect Heights High School, where she was on the art staff of her high school's publication, the Cardinal. Clausen graduated in 1960.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> In the late 1960s Clausen co-founded a women's collective print shop at 573 Metropolitan Avenue in Brooklyn. Fellow founders included Nina Hutchinson, Linda Feldman, Barbara Kaminsky, Karen Ninnis, Alice Moffett, Page Dougherty, Hazel Doren, and Alice Appleton. The shop was called the Greenpoint Print Shop, and was supported from donations of equipment from David Dellinger, who published Liberation Magazine in New Jersey. At the print shop Clausen designed and printed materials for several local activist groups, including the Southern Conference Educational Fund, the Southside Community of Greenpoint, the National Association for Irish Freedom, Yellow Pearl (an Asian-American organization based in Chinatown), Los Tintos Indios, a Red Hook, Brooklyn-based Puerto Rican group, and several women's liberation groups.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> Clausen served as president of the Greenpoint Print Shop until late 1972, when she and the other officers all resigned and turned the corporation over to another group. During this period and beyond, Clausen participated in local activistorganizations, including the Flatbush Committee to End the War in Vietnam. She also designed and published informational packets to educate women about the Women's Liberation Movement. Her work in this movement included contributions to the Feminist journal, Up from Under, which focused on working women.</field>
