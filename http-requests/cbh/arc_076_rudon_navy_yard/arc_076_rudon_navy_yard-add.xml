    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection, with material dated 1951 to 1972, contains documents, pamphlets, newsletters, and photographs collected by Evelyn Rudon during her career at the New York Naval Shipyard Technical Library. Items in the collection include personnel forms and correspondence relative to Rudon's position as a civilian employee, employee publications, and office memoranda. Photographs in the collection depict scenes of Navy Yard office work, including members of the local union and the library where Evelyn Rudon was employed. Rudon is a subject in all photographs in the series, which include black-and-white glossy prints and a polaroid. Material in the collection documents the closure of the Navy Yard in 1966 and subsequent transfer of its employees to new positions. In addition, Rudon's personnel documents and clippings about the library provide a sketch of the Technical Library's staff and work throughout the 1950s and 1960s.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Evelyn Rudon (1904-1997) was a lifelong resident of New York City. She married John J. Rudon (1907-1971) in Brooklyn on May 17, 1941, and the couple lived in Astoria, Queens. She began work as a civilian employee at the New York Naval Shipyard (commonly known as the Brooklyn Navy Yard) in 1951, spending the bulk of her career as a library assistant and clerk in the Technical Library. Following the closure of the Navy Yard in 1966, Mrs. Rudon continued to work as a clerk in the Navy Supervisor of Shipbuilding's Brooklyn office. She retired from the Navy in 1972.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The origins of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (officially known as the New York Naval Shipyard) date back to 1801, when the United States Navy acquired what had previously been a small, privately owned shipyard in order to construct naval vessels.  By the time the Department of Defense ceased shipbuilding activities at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1966, 88 vessels had been manufactured at the facility.  In 1967, the Brooklyn Navy Yard was acquired by the City of New York and was converted for private commercial use.</field>
