His photographs have been exhibited by the Museum of the City of New York, the Brooklyn Museum, the Queens Museum, the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts, and in numerous galleries. His films have screened at film festivals worldwide, including Slamdance, DOC NYC, Rooftop Films, Black Maria, and Fantasia. He has presented talks about his work for Columbia University, New York University, the New School, and many other colleges. His work has been featured by The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, PBS NewsHour, Wired, New York Magazine, and Nature Climate Change.
