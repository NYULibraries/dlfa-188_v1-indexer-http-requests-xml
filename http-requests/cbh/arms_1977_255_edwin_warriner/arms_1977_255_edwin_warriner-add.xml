    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the collection includes the research notes and related materials gathered by Reverend Edwin Warriner during the last decades of the nineteenth century in preparation for a planned, but never completed, encyclopedia of Methodism on Long Island, New York. Warriner's handwritten notes concern Methodist ministers, churches, circuits, and locales throughout Long Island. African Methodist Episcopal (AME), German and Norwegian churches are included. Warriner's files include correspondence in response to his inquiries for information; transcriptions of church records, histories and other documents; draft manuscript entries; newspaper clippings; and photographs, such as cabinet cards, cartes-de-visite, and tintypes. Warriner's files also include some original documents dating from as early as 1791.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also includes printed material dating from the twentieth century that was added to the Warriner files by the Methodist Historical Society and donated with the collection to the Long Island Historical Society (now Brooklyn Historical Society). This material consists mostly of special anniversary publications and other such documents that include historical notes on various Methodist churches.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Edwin Warriner was born on January 19, 1839, in Ellisburg, NY. He was born into a religious family; his father, Solomon J. Warriner, was a farmer and local Methodist preacher. By the time he was fifteen, Warriner was teaching public school and had obtained a license to be a Methodist preacher. He went on to study theology at the Biblical Institute of Concord, New Hampshire, from which he graduated in 1861. Warriner then began his career in the ministry in South Meriden, Connecticut. At the beginning of the Civil War, a regiment of soldiers was garrisoned there and he began to minister to them. Warriner was appointed as chaplain to the regiment and traveled with them for three years during the war. Afterwards, he settled in Brooklyn as a Methodist minister.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By 1880, Warriner was Secretary of the New York East Conference Historical Society. His two published books, The Old Sands Street Methodist Episcopal Church of Brooklyn, NY, published in 1885, and The Warriner Family of New England Origin, a history of his family from 1628 to 1898, show his passion for both history and genealogy. Warriner died in 1898, shortly after finishing the Warriner Family manuscript, which was published a year later. Warriner's purpose in collecting the documents forming most of this collection was to write an encyclopedia of Methodism on Long Island. He died before producing a written manuscript based on his research. The bulk of the letters in this collection, in which Warriner asks for information about a certain church or reverend, dates from the 1870s-1890s, indicating that he had been collecting information about Methodism on Long Island for the last 30 years of his life. </field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">In 1955, the collection was initially placed in "permanent custody" with the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) by the New York East Annual Conference of the Methodist Church, through Reverend Robert H. Dolliver, Secretary of the Methodist Historical Society in the City of New York. Extant records suggest that, in 1958, the Conference agreed to change the status of the collection, making it a gift to the Brooklyn Historical Society.</field>
