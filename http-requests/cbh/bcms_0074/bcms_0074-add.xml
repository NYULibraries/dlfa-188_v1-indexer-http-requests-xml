    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of photographs from artist Ann Rosen's series In the Presence of Family: Brooklyn Portraits and Revisiting In the Presence of Family: Brooklyn Portraits. Photographs are both print and digital, with 68 print photographs and 68 digital photographs (38 of which are unique). The portraits were taken at the Brooklyn Pride street fair, Fabulous Fifth Avenue street fair and at the artist's studio between 2003-2007. Later portraits were made at the Five Myles Gallery in 2010. Prints in boxes 1 and 2 include painted matboards with a handwritten "family story" on them. These prints were included in a 2004 exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library. An exhibit catalog from Rosen's 2020 show Being Seen is also included. A portion of this collection is available through the Library's Digital Collections portal.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Artist statement from Ann Rosen's website, 2021</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In my project, In the Presence of Family: Brooklyn Portraits, I document the concept of family as it is defined by the subjects in my photographs — through not only their familiarity, closeness and commitment, but also their heterogeneity, openness and diversity.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographing people in familial relations began in 1999 and spanned the next decade. This project unveils interactions and relationships between individuals in family situations from neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn. It explores issues of race, gender, class and family diversity, highlighting the connections that transcend the categories our society commonly uses to define the family. These images raise our awareness of those around us, of their differences, struggles and achievements. This generates understanding and ultimately leads toward a higher degree of empathy and tolerance. We learn to appreciate the connections — whether by blood or not — which enrich all of our lives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As Charlotta Kotik, Curator Emerita, Contemporary Art, Brooklyn Museum, states in her essay about this project, "The nuclear family — father, mother, children — is no longer a prevailing model. The structure is dramatically changing. Newly created families with children from previous marriages, gay and lesbian partners, children within same sex families, multi-racial adoption, and of course, one parent families are all part of our world and all are documented in the work."  </field>
