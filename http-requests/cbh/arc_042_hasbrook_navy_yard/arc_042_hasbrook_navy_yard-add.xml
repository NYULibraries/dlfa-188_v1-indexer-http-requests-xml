Items include reports, newspaper clippings, programs, newsletters, correspondence, photographs, certificates, and various ephemera.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Louise Hasbrook worked as a secretary at the Brooklyn Navy YMCA beginning in 1934.  In 1959, she was promoted to the position of administrative assistant and secretary to the Executive, where she dealt with policy relating to personnel, payroll, business operations, and general administration.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) was founded in London in 1844 by George Williams, a sales assistant in a draper's shop, as a way to help struggling young men find solace from the streets through Bible study and prayer.  The first United States YMCA branch was established in Boston in 1851, and soon the organization underwent an explosive outgrowth in popularity, with branches being established in major cities across the country.  New York City's branch was established in 1852, and Brooklyn's in 1853.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gradually the YMCA transformed on a national scale into a seminal social institution offering dormitories, athletic facilities, and summer camps.  Along with these new functions, the YMCA also took on a greater involvement in social issues and began advocating for social equality and performing relief work.  In reflection of its progressive social stance, the YMCA also began welcoming women, children, and all ethnic groups into its community.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During the Civil War (1861-1865), the YMCA extended its activities to the U.S. Armed Forces, with YMCA members giving over one million Bibles to soldiers.  In response to the Navy's request to continue offering services in peacetime, in 1899 the YMCA established its first permanent branch of the Navy YMCA in Brooklyn, located at 167 Sands Street near the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  Facilities were also erected on the premises of the Navy Yard itself in 1902, and throughout the first half of the twentieth century the Brooklyn Navy YMCA flourished as a haven offering religious, social, and entertainment services to members of the armed forces.  It closed its doors in 1964, having served an estimated 47 million military personnel.</field>
