    <field name="abstract_teim">The bulk of this collection consists of handwritten correspondence between John Crean Cardwell and Grace Ann Parker, dating 1891-1897. Regular correspondence also dates 1900-1905, when Grace lived in Switzerland and New York State to receive treatment for tuberculosis. The letters discuss John's medical practice, details about patients and treatments, and daily life in Brooklyn and Worcester, Massachusetts. Cardwell and Parker also discuss their relationship, plan for their 1897 wedding, and discuss various friends and family members. Also included is a photograph album, presumably compiled by Grace's nephew's grandmother-in-law, Anna Maria Conselyea after she married into the Irwin family.</field>
