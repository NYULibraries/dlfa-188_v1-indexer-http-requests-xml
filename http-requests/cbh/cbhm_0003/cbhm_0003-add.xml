The bulk of the collection includes photographic negatives and prints created between 1952 and 1990. All film is 35mm or medium format black-and-white, with most negative sheets paired with a corresponding contact sheet print. Aptecker's numbering system has been maintained to label negative sleeves, although numbers are not consistent.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subjects include photographs of Aptecker's honeymoon in Europe, portraits of friends and family, classrooms, boxers, and museum visitors.  Street scenes show Manhattan, Brooklyn, and presumably the Bronx, as well as the Coney Island beach and boardwalk. Also included are negatives and prints for Aptecker's books, Beyond Despair and Passing Through. Most prints were created from negatives in sub-series 6.1 and are black-and-white, although some have been hand colored. </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">George Aptecker was born on March 5, 1931 in the Bronx to Moses and Diana Aptecker. He graduated from James Monroe High School in June 1949, working in a pillow factory before joining the United States Army in October 1951. While overseas, Aptecker had the opportunity to travel in Germany, France and Spain, photographing street scenes, portraits, and bull fights. After returning to New York, he purchased a new camera and enrolled in the New York Institute of Photography. In 1955 he began journaling, a habit he would maintain for the rest of his life.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1957 Aptecker married Sandra "Sandie" Bender; their daughter Diana was born in 1964 followed by Andrea "Annie" born in 1968. During this time he wrote and contributed articles to U.S. Camera Magazine, Camera 35 Magazine, and Modern Photography Magazine. He also exhibited his work at the Village Camera Club, Underground Gallery, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  His photographs appeared in print for the New York Times and N.Y World Telegram. The family purchased a house in Brooklyn, but Aptecker was soon unemployed and looking for work. In 1973 he began driving a New York City taxi, recording his experiences in his photography work and journals. He then began work as a night watchman at the Metropolitan Museum of Art while maintaining a small business collecting and dealing fine art photography. The family moved to New Jersey in 1975. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Aptecker's book, Beyond Despair, a collection of symbolic photographs and quotes about the Holocaust was published in 1980 with a foreward by Elie Wiesel. Aptecker's second book, Passing Through, was not published. He continued to exhibit his work in New York City and New Jersey, and in 1981 was named Director of Development for the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation. Aptecker and Sandy divorced in 1984. In the 1990s Aptecker's eyesight began to deteriorate and he stopped making photographs. He died on June 3, 2018 at the age of 87. His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and several private collections. </field>
