    <field name="abstract_teim">Gabriel Furman (1800-1854) was a lawyer, Whig politician, New York State senator, and historian of early Brooklyn, New York, known for his Notes Geographical and Historical, Relating to the Town of Brooklyn, on Long-Island (1824). The Furman papers principally include thirteen journals dating from circa 1816 to circa 1854 in which Furman both documented his personal observations about Brooklyn and New York and recorded historical items relevant to his writing and lectures. Among the wide diversity of topics found in the journals are epidemics of cholera and yellow fever, financial crises, daily weather conditions, theatre and the arts, politics, and religious belief. The collection also holds Furman manuscript histories, notably one on theatre in New York. Finally, the collection includes several pages from a Furman letter book, principally from 1824, and a page of his legal drafts from 1823. The bulk of the correspondence consists of letters written by Furman to his father, William, who was a New York State assemblyman away at Albany. The principal subjects of these letters concerned local perspectives on matters that would be taken up by the legislature, including Brooklyn's effort to gain a charter for a proposed Long Island Bank, the proposed act of incorporation for Brooklyn, and Furman's opposition to a proposed expansion of capital punishment in New York. Local electoral politics is also a subject of the correspondence.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Gabriel Furman papers consist primarily of several volumes of Furman's Notes and Memoranda, of which the earliest in the collection were also called common place books. These journals span a period from October 28, 1815, when Furman was 15 years old, to September 10, 1854, two months before he died. However, pages are not consistently arranged chronologically, and many entries are undated. 
 
Furman was an avid -- perhaps even compulsive -- collector of information on a vast range of topics. Perhaps 75% of his Notes and Memoranda consists of information copied from other sources, rather than his own observations. He noted Dutch colonial laws of New York, ancient proclamations of Parliament, census figures, commerce data, weather reports from around the world, American Indian culture, observations of sea serpents, arguments that the center of the earth could be reached by ship from the North Pole, references to Shakespeare and the arts, and a host of other unrelated topics. These entries range from a line or two to dozens of pages. They are a mix of transcriptions, summaries, bibliographic references, and commentary.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Furman's personal observations include childhood memories of early Brooklyn and street scenes and local color from his walks around Manhattan, Brooklyn and Hoboken. He also noted natural events, such as the appearance of the Aurora Borealis (multiple times) and infestations of black ants and caterpillars. He extensively covers two important historical events: the cholera epidemic of 1832 and the financial panic of 1837. He occasionally comments on contemporary politics, including some reference to the issues of slavery and abolition, but this is not a significant portion of the journals. The highlights of each journal are as follows:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notes and Memoranda, Vol. 2 (Common Place Book, Vol. 2): circa 1815-circa 1823.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notes and Memoranda, Vol. 17: This journal has only blank pages.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notes and Memoranda, Vol. 18: There are no entries from Furman in this journal and the bulk consists of only blank pages. The journal has entries of 1862-1863 from William Smith Pelletreau indicating that Southampton town records of 1640 to 1660 would be transcribed in the journal. Aside from one partial entry, no such transcriptions are present.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the Notes and Memoranda volumes, the collection includes both a manuscript outline or draft and a published version of Furman's Notes, Geographical and Historical, Relating to the Town of Brooklyn, on Long-Island. Other manuscripts include Furman's Ancient Chronology of New York From First Discovery to 1799 (1822), A Sketch of the History of Theatres in the United States (circa 1828), and a transcription of Jeremiah Johnson's translation of Vanderdonck's New Netherlands. The Ancient Chronology manuscript is written on pages of an account book, possibly of one John Tyler, with entries dated 1778-1781.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Finally, the collection includes several pages from a Furman letter book, principally from 1824, and a page of his legal drafts from 1823. The bulk of the correspondence consists of letters written by Furman to his father, William, who was a New York State Assemblyman away at Albany. The principal subjects of these letters concerned local perspectives on matters that would be taken up by the legislature, including Brooklyn's effort to gain a charter for a proposed Long Island Bank, the proposed act of incorporation for Brooklyn, and Furman's opposition to a proposed expansion of capital punishment in New York. Local electoral politics is also a subject of the correspondence. Among the Brooklynites mentioned in the correspondence are Alden Spooner, Leffert Lefferts, and Joseph Sprague. The three legal drafts concern breach of marriage contract, sexual assault, and trespass.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gabriel Furman (January 23, 1800-November 11, 1854) was -- and remains -- a respected historian of early Brooklyn. His Notes Geographical and Historical, Relating to the Town of Brooklyn, on Long-Island (1824) is available today in a recent reprint as well as on line. His Antiquities of Long Island and his edition of Daniel Denton's A Brief Description Of New York, Formerly Called New Netherlands, With The Places Thereunto Adjoining have also been recently reprinted.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Little is known of Furman's youth; he attended Columbia Academy in Bergen (now part of Jersey City), New Jersey, from 1814-1816. Professionally, Furman became a lawyer, having studied law beginning in 1823 in the office of Elisha W. King of Beekman St., New York. Furman was later a justice of the Brooklyn municipal court, a member of the New York State Senate (1839-1842), and an unsuccessful Whig candidate for lieutenant governor.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Furman's notes, memoranda and journals add a little humanity to the dry facts of his life: He lived at 103 Willow Street, Brooklyn, and was particularly fond of his garden and the birds it attracted. He loved nature, especially trees, birds and nature walks, many of which he took in Hoboken and described in practically lyrical detail. He loved books and was an avid collector. He disliked Andrew Jackson, the "democratical" party, the Loco Focos, Tammany Hall, abolitionists, the troublesome lower classes and immigrants in general. He was strongly if conventionally religious, and in his journals frequently thanked the Almighty for His mercy or prayed for the Almighty to ameliorate some situation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Furman's journals mention no romantic connections, memorable social events or close friends. In 1832, he developed an opium addiction, lost interest in his career, and began a descent into poverty. Although he remained active through much of the 1840s as a historian and lecturer, Furman was financially ruined by the late 1840s. He died in 1854 in the Brooklyn City hospital and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.</field>

    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The Furman papers were acquired over time from various sources. Perhaps the earliest acquisition was the published version of Notes Geographical and Historical, received from Henry Stiles in 1863. The Ancient Chronology of New York manuscript was acquired from Henry C. Murphy in 1865. The manuscript Sketch of the History of Theatres/Vanderdonck's New Netherlands and the journal Miscellanies were purchased in 1895-1896 from a Furman descendant, Samuel Hand Furman. </field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Volume 17 of the Notes and Memoranda was acquired from J. Carson Brevoort. The provenance of the other volumes of Notes and Memoranda and the letter book and legal draft pages has not been traced, as of 2010. There is some indication that these were acquired together at auction, prior to 1893.</field>
