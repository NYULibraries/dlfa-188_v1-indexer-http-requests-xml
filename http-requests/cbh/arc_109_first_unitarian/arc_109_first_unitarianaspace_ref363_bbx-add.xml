    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Third Unitarian Congregation was established in 1867 in order to accommodate parishioners of the First Unitarian Congregation who had been travelling from the Fort Greene and Clinton Hill neighborhoods to attend services at the Church of the Saviour in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Frederick A. Farley assisted in duties as a minister until the Third Congregation installed Stephen H. Camp as minister in 1869. Camp became the Third Congregation's most prominent minister and in addition to encouraging organized charitable works and teaching within the Congregation's Sunday School he also shepherded the Congregation from their first space in Unity Chapel (built in 1868 with the assistance of the First Congregation) to Unity Church (built in 1886). The Third Congregation sold its church and united with the First Congregation in 1925.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Third Unitarian Congregation series contains the records of the Third Congregation's organization and operation including its by-laws, society and trustee minutes, resolutions, and financial records. The series also contains records of the Congregation's charitable work such as through the Branch Alliance, the Charitable Fund, the Ladies Benevolent and Social Society, and other clubs and groups organized by the Church. Correspondence regarding the merger of the Third Congregation's merger with the First Congregation can also be found here.</field>
