    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Willow Place Chapel was built in 1876 under the direction of Alfred T. White who was seeking a more proper setting for the settlement school under his charge. The Chapel functioned somewhat separately from the Church of the Saviour and conducted its own evening services as well as adopting the First Congregation's Sunday School. In addition to these tasks, some other classes (such as in music or sewing), clubs, and welfare work operated out of Willow Place Chapel. In 1906 Columbia House was added to the settlement complex and carried on its own outreach and community work in conjunction with Willow Place Chapel. The Willow Place Chapel and Columbia House series contains the records related to the work carried on within these buildings and on behalf of the members including annual and trustee reports, deacon meeting minutes, Sunday school records, and the records of the Chapel Association. The series also holds relevant building records in regards to construction and alterations, financial information including accounts and salaries, various records on clubs and events that functioned out of the Chapel, and records related to health and social work carried out by the Chapel's staff. Prior to the establishment of Willow Place Chapel these tasks, particularly social and settlement work, were done at the Furman Street Mission. Reports and other records relevant to work done at the Furman Street Mission can be found in this series, particularly among material before 1876.</field>
