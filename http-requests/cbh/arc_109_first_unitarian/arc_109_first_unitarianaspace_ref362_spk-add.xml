    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Second Unitarian Congregation first split from the First Congregation in 1840 over dissatisfaction with Minister Fredrick Holland. The congregations united in 1842 (after Holland's resignation) but split again in 1851. The Second Unitarian Congregation series represents the records of the Second Unitarian Congregation during both of these splits. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Congregation's first permanent minister was Samuel Longfellow, installed in 1853. The Second Unitarian Congregation took a progressive stance under Longfellow who occasionally preached against slavery and delivered an infamous sermon in praise of John Brown. Some of Longfellow's sermons can be found in the file on him. A parishioner's complaint and resignation of his pew in reaction to Longfellow's John Brown sermon can be found in the "Finances: Pew Rentals" folder. Longfellow's tenure was followed by Nahor A. Staples who also included abolitionist views in his sermons. The Second Congregation's influential minister John White Chadwick (installed 1864) is also well represented in this series through his correspondence, sermons and articles written by and about him, particularly memorials after his death.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series contains records related to the regular functions and activities of the Second Congregation including trustee records, financial records of pew renters and subscribers, committee reports and record books kept by the Sunday School. The series also contains many records of the Second Congregation's Branch Alliance, a women's group that did charity work and eventually folded into the First Congregation's Samaritan Alliance when the Congregations reunited in 1924.</field>
