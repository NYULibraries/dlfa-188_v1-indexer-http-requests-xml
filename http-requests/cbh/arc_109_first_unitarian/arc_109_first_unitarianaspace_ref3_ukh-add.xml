    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Ministers series contains files kept regarding the installation, resignation, and other major matters for the ministers of the Church of the Saviour. The materials are primarily correspondence and copies of resolutions and votes of the Society on these matters. Some files also include sermons, relevant news clippings, and articles . The file on Frederick W. Holland has correspondence regarding protest and controversy over his leadership during a developing schism in the Church as well as his record of funerals, baptisms, and marriages in the Church during his tenure. Clippings and Orders of Service related to Alfred E. Goodnough, H. Price Collier, and Samuel A. Eliot can be found in the Scrapbooks series. Additional sermons by H. Price Collier can also be found in the Scrapbooks series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the case of John Lathrop there are several folders due to the bulk of material. These are broken up by subject including his installation, committees he was involved with, other churches he communicated with, and memorial services after his death. Some of the committees here include the the League of Nations Association, the Long Island Historical Society, the Religious Arts Guild, refugee aid associations and other organizations dealing with ecumenical issues, the peace movement, and welfare and aid to the needy. While these files relate to what the Church kept in regards to Lathrop, for documents related to Lathrop's work, including his sermons, see the John H. Lathrop Files series.</field>
