As a young man, Fish was deeply involved in the prohibition movement, where he organized temperance lectures and served as Chief Templar of the Independent Order of Good Templars. Fish first attended Columbia University Law School but transferred to the New York Law School and was one of the newly founded school's first graduates in 1893. He passed the New York State bar exam in 1896 and served over the years as an attorney for Grover Cleveland, David B. Still, and James G. Blaine. Fish's professional achievements included eight years as a magistrate of Brooklyn's traffic court and a successful 1927 campaign bid as the Democratic candidate for judge in the Municipal Court of the second district. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1896, Fish married Margaret Summers, who died fourteen months later. In 1901, he married Emma Ellis. Lawrence and Emma had one son, Lawrence Chaffee Fish, Jr. (b. 1906). Outside of his career, Fish was a member of numerous social clubs, including the Andrew Jackson Club and the Elks, and was active in the First Free Baptist Church.</field>
