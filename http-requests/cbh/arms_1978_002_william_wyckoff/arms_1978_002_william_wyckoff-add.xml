Wyckoff papers consist primarily of deeds, indentures, estate records, and genealogical research for various families in Brooklyn (Kings County) and Queens County.

Wyckoff on numerous families.  Family names include the Spader, Griffin, Forman, King, Titus, Lott, Lawrence, Vandervoort, Van Nostrand, Suydam, Renne, Williamson, Moore, and Wyckoff families.  Some of Wyckoff's manuscript writings about people and places in New York are also included, such as "Old Clove Road" and "The Red Man in the United States."

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The deeds and indentures in this collection are for land in Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend, Hempstead, Jamaica, New Jersey, Newtown, New Utrecht, and Orange County, many of which are accompanied by typescript copies.  There is also material pertaining to New Lots, including an agreement of people in the town to aid the reverend with payment to rent a house, an agreement of subscribers to pay to have a fence built, and a list of inhabitants of western road district in New Lots, including John Ferdinand and James Wyckoff.  Members of the Suydam, Eldert, Wyckoff, and Lott families make up the majority of the estate records in this collection. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other document types in this collection include property maps for Gravesend, Flatlands, Flatbush, and Jamaica, as well as an Eastern Long Island Railroad map.  Also included herein are stock certificates (1838-1890) for Atlantic State Bank (John and Peter Lott) and Long Island City of Newtown Railroad Company (John H.

A small number of agreements and business financial information for the Williamsburgh Turnpike Road and Bridge Company is in the collection. There is also a petition from the Black Stump Hook, Ladder and Bucket Company of Queens County with a blueprint of its fire district and alarm system route.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Revolutionary War-era documents (1701-1782) herein consist of inventories and accounts of cattle and wood.

Lott (1871) and a commission to Nicholas Wyckoff as Ensign in the 93rd regiment (1814).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection includes several documents related to African-Americans. There are two enslaved persons' bills of sale; one mentions two children that were "born free" (1814) and the second mentions the ownership of an enslaved boy "until he gets his freedom by due course of the law" (1813). Various estate records refer to enslaved African-Americans, either to be inherited or to be freed (1746). Correspondence to Johannes Eldert states that "a free black" had made complaint of being "infirm and unable to provide support for himself," and that he, being an overseer of the poor, should pay him 10 shillings per week until he can be transported to his legal residence (1807). Among other miscellaneous documents concerning African-Americans is a family tree for the Van Voorhees family with references to inheritances of enslaved people.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">William F. Wyckoff is a descendant of Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, the common ancestor of the Wyckoff family, and one of the most influential leaders during 17th century settlement in New Amsterdam.  Claesen-Wyckoff and his wife, Greitje van Ness, eventually settled in Flatlands, Brooklyn, in what is now the historic Wyckoff Homestead.  Claesen-Wyckoff and his wife had a total of eleven children, who married into several different families, creating a vast and complex genealogy spanning the entire country.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">William F. Wyckoff (1858-1930) is the son of Sarah Hays Forman (1823-1901) and Reverend Jacob S. Wyckoff.  The common ancestor on the Forman side is John Forman, one of many Scotch passengers that came to the United States in 1685 via the "Henry and Francis," led by George Scot.  Scot had originally planned to sell the passengers as servants once they reached the new world, but he died on board, so the survivors appealed to the courts for their freedom; upon which, John Forman settled at Woodbridge in Middlesex County, N.J.  William F. Wyckoff's grandfather, William P. Forman, was in the Navy in the Civil War, and was paymaster of the fleet at Pensacola, Florida, and died there of yellow fever in 1863.  William F. Wyckoff's father, Jacob S. Wyckoff, was the first minister of the Reformed Dutch Church of Colts Neck in New Jersey from 1856 until 1864.   </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
William F. Wyckoff was a writer and genealogist; a good portion of his genealogical notes and research is located in this collection.  Wyckoff's genealogical achievements were widely recognized, and in 1939, nine years after his death, Wyckoff received a certificate of merit, the highest ranking achievement, from the Institute of American Genealogy.  Wyckoff's publications include: The Wyckoff Family in America: a Genealogy (1934, four years after his death); Inscriptions from Lott family burying ground [and others] (1914, with Josephine C Mayou Frost), and The Old Town Church Jamaica, NY (1910), pertaining to the old Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens.</field>
