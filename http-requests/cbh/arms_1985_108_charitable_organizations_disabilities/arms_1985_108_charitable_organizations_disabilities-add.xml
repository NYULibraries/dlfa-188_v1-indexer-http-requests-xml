From the beginning, efforts to help the blind was based on making them self-reliant and self-supporting. Brooklyn was a forerunner in providing services, education, and assistance to the blind.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Public assistance to the blind began as early as 1718 in New York State. From the beginning, efforts to help the blind was based on making them self-reliant and self-supporting. Eye diseases were much feared in New York City during the 19th century and into the early 20th century. The rise of contagious eye diseases such as conjunctivitis and trachoma occurred simultaneously with the establishment of orphanages in the city, where diseases could spread easily and quickly. During the 19th century, infirmaries and hospitals specializing in the treatment and prevention of eye disease were established throughout the city, with the earliest example being the New York Eye Infirmary (now the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary) founded in 1820. New York also led the country in educating blind children with the founding of the first school to provide formal education for blind children, The New York Institute for the Blind, established in 1832. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Brooklyn was also a forerunner in providing services, education, and assistance to the blind. Homes for blind children such as the Sunshine Home Nursery, Hospital, and Kindergarten for Blind Babies, established in 1904 and located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Dyker Heights, provided education and training enabling the children to become self-reliant.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Dyker Heights Home for Blind Children, organized 1904 and incorporated in 1905, was located at 1255 84th Street (near 13th Avenue) Brooklyn, N.Y. The building was purchased in 1906. The Home's mission was to prepare the children to be independent adults through leading a healthy lifestyle, education, and training. It was a non-sectarian organization that accepted any child regardless of nationality or ethnicity. In 1910, the Dun House for Older Children, located at 1256 83rd Street, was acquired by the Home. The Dyker Heights Home for Blind Children also worked with the New York State Board of Education to provide a classroom at P.S. 127 for older children after graduating kindergarten.</field>
