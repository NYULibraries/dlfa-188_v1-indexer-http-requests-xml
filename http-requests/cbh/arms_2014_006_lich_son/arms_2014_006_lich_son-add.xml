    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records document the lives of nursing students from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. Aspects of student life are illustrated extensively in the school's yearbooks, newsletters, and photographs. Special events, such as commencements and student recognition ceremonies (pinnings and cappings), are especially well documented. Some objects which belonged to students, such as nursing caps and commemorative pins, are also included in the collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The adminstration of the Alumnae Association is also documented in the collection. Researchers interested in the operations of the organization should consult Series 1: Articles of incorporation and by-laws, Series 2: Board of Directors meeting minutes, Series 3: Subject files series, and Series 6: Newsletters.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Nursing education and the school's curriculum is not extensively documented in the collection, although a small sampling of student work and handbooks can be found in Series 8: Students, alumni, and faculty and Series 10: Handbooks.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Long Island College Hospital (LICH) was founded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1858. The LICH Training School for Nurses, popularly known as the LICH School of Nursing, was established in 1883. Irene Sutcliffe, a graduate of the New York Hospital Training School, was selected to organize the school. The first class consisted of just three students. Irene Sutcliffe resigned her position in 1885 and was replaced by her twin sister, Ida Sutcliffe. During this period, the nurses' training program lasted two years, and there were no grades or examinations (the program would be expanded to three years in 1899).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Alumnae Association of the Training School for Nurses was established in 1895. In 1904, Anne D. VanKirk replaced Isa Sutcliffe as head of the nursing school, and the school's training regimen was updated to conform with New York state guidelines. VanKirk was replaced by Miss E. Robinson, herself a graduate of the LICH School of Nursing, in 1920.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The school received temporary accreditation from the National League of Nursing in 1953. 1958 marked the first year that male students were admitted to the school. LICH became affiliated with Long Island University in 1960, which resulted in a new emphasis on academics at the nursing school (for the first time liberal arts were included in the school's curriculum). In 1962, the three year program was reduced back to a two year program (it would be shortened again to 22 months in 1975). The school switched academic affiliations twice in the ensuing years, to Packer Collegiate Institute in 1969 and then to St. Francis College in 1972.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1977 the school moved to St. Peter's School at 397 Hicks Street. The class of 1977 was the first to receive Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degrees. The school's academic affiliation changed once again in 1979 to Brooklyn College. Evening classes were first established in 1981, and primarily catered to men who chose nursing as a second career.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In May 2011, LICH became part of the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, and was renamed University Hospital of Brooklyn at Long Island College Hospital. Soon thereafter it was announced the LICH School of Nursing would no longer accept new students into its nursing program. The school officially closed in May 2013, and soon thereafter the Long Island College Hospital also closed.</field>
