    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The register is one leather-bound volume measuring 8.5 by 13 inches. About half of the pages are filled with the signatures of visitors to the Coney Island House hotel from 1848-1852. Visitors signed their name and gave place of origin. By far the majority of the visitors come from Brooklyn, New York City and New York State. Sometimes room numbers are indicated, and sometimes meteorological observations are written in the margins, such as the note "Awful hotâ€”awful!!" on Saturday, September 13, 1851.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the early nineteenth century, Coney Island was a part of the town of Gravesend. By 1823, the island was getting more visitors and outside notice, and the town authorized the formation of the Coney Island Road and Bridge Company to create better access to the island. The company created Shell Road, a one-mile stretch paved with oyster shells, and made Coney Island Creek far more passable with a wooden bridge. The number of visitors continued to climb, and in 1829, the company built the first hotel at Coney Island, Coney Island House.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The hotel was popular and during its heyday in the mid-nineteenth century it is said to have hosted many famous persons. Some of these famous guests signed the register, but there is some question as to the authenticity of all of the names (a 2012 Brooklyn Collection blog post and its follow up inspired lively debate in the comments section). These famous names include Washington Irving, Herman Melville, E.A. Poe, Jenny Lind, P.T. Barnum, Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and Lyman Beecher. Some of the signed names, such as "Bill Blunderbuss, Shirt Tail Road," are evidently intended as jokes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, the hotel later became a boarding house and was renamed the Oceanic Hotel. "In 1922 it was moved inland and in 1930, after it had sunk to such a low level as to be abandoned, it was destroyed by fire. Toward the close of its existence it was the oldest building in Coney Island" (March 5, 1939).</field>
