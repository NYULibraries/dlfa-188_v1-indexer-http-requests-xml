    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Walter A. Carley collection contains materials from 1905-1956 with bulk dates of 1920-1935. The arrangement consists of five series: Knights of Columbus (K of C) records; Greenpoint Peoples Regular Democratic Organization (GPRDO) records; Walter A. Carley papers; Photographs; and Postcards. The first three series contain souvenir programs, posters and ephemera from theater performances, balls and dinners. The remainder of the K of C and GPRDO records consists of business records, meeting minutes and correspondence for the various committees Carley was involved in within these organizations, as well as periodicals and news clippings. Carley's personal records include records of his schooling, his Catholic affiliations and activities, his World War I service and subsequent veteran status, sheet music and a small portion of his father's business records. The photographs include images of Carley, group photographs and a portrait of Rose M. Casey. The picture postcards mostly pertain to the K of C Institute in Brooklyn.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Walter A. Carley was born near the turn of the twentieth century and grew up in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. He completed his childhood schooling and confirmation at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church and School on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint in June, 1907. Carley then attended St. John's College, now St. John's University, in Brooklyn from 1907-1909. He served in World War I as a Navy seaman and storekeeper at St. Julian's Creek in Portsmouth, Virginia from 1918-1919. An honorable discharge followed in 1921. Other than Carley's military service records and veteran insurance records, there is little indication that Carley had any lasting involvement with the United States Navy after his World War I post.</field>

As an active member of the Knights of Columbus (K of C), Lexington Council, No. 293, based in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, Carley served as the chair of multiple publicity and advertising committees. He was also an active member of the Greenpoint Peoples Regular Democratic Organization (GPRDO). This political organization fostered Regular Democratic values and promoted the Regular Democratic agenda throughout Brooklyn. The Regular Democrats tended to be conservative in apposition to Reform Democrats who espoused to be against the democratic "machine" of city, state and local government. Carley is cited on the Web site "The Political Graveyard" as a Brooklyn Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940, 1944, and 1948. The U.S. Democratic National Party possesses further information about convention delegates. It may also be helpful to consult local and national papers for Convention coverage and delegate listings (e.g., The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, The New York Times, etc.). It is unclear whether politics served as Carley's sole profession. The collection provides no evidence supporting the pursuit of another occupation. According to his personal records, Carley's father, Edward Carley, was the owner of a Brooklyn plumbing business. If Carley inherited this business, there is no record of it in the collection. See Brooklyn city directories for this era.</field>

The only other family member mentioned in the collection is Carley's sister, Emily Carley. Included in the collection is her confirmation certificate from St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church. </field>

This collection highlights Carley's political and organizational involvement, but offers little insight into his personal life and family affairs.</field>
