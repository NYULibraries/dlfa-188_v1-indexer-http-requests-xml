    <field name="bioghist_teim">Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852) was a German educator and founder of the first Kindergarten. His early childhood education philosophy focused on creative play and a close relationship between parents and teachers. In 1850 the Kindergarten was banned by Prussian authorities, but followers of Froebel's philosophies immigrated to Britain where they opened a Kindergarten the following year. The Froebel Society was founded in London in November 1874 to help spread Froebel's ideas and maintain standards for Kindergarten teachers and classrooms.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> The Froebel Society operating in Brooklyn was organized in 1884 by mothers of children attending the Froebel Academy. The Academy was located in Bedford-Stuyvesant, first in the home of a teacher and later in Hickock Hall on today's Herbert Von King Park. The Society members were heavily involved with the day-to-day operations of the school, meeting monthly with teachers and working to fundraise and furnish the classroom. Money raised also paid for specialists and guest lecturers invited to speak at Society meetings.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> The Society was incorporated on June 12, 1891 for "the advancement of education and educational interests and the promotion of self-culture and mutual helpfulness." As the Academy hired capable, well-educated teachers the Society became less involved with the daily operations of the school and more focused on activities for members. By 1918 the Society had over 80 members, including women without children enrolled in the Academy. Activities such as the Froebel Chorus, Bible study and group discussions on art, literature and politics made the Society an attractive option for progressive Brooklyn women.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> By 1955 membership had declined to 37. The remaining members decided to disband the club and donate their materials to the Brooklyn Public Library. The European branch of the Frobel Society merged with the National Froebel Union in 1938 to become the National Froebel Foundation, which dissolved in 1975.</field>
