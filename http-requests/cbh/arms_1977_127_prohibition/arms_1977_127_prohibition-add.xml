    <field name="abstract_teim">The Prohibition Collection contains temperance periodicals, publications, correspondence, photographs, lecture invitations, campaign material, and newspaper clippings, 1893-1942, relating to the Prohibition movement in the U.S. and in New York State and City in particular.  This material provides a look at this American political movement from the local level in New York and Kings Counties. The bulk of the material was donated in 1932 by George B. Hilliard, who was involved in the Prohibition movement for decades and was a county organizer and executive committee member for the Prohibition County Committee of New York. Some of the items date from 1933 to 1942 and their provenance cannot be established.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Prohibition Collection documents the activities of the New York State Prohibition Party as well as many other organizations that were active in the prohibition movement in New York City and Brooklyn, including the Prohibition Parties of New York and Kings Counties, the Woman's Christian Temperance League, and the Young People's Prohibition League.  While the collection covers the years 1893-1942, the bulk of materials in the collection covers roughly the mid 1890s through the 1910s when the Prohibition movement in the United States was at its most active.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included in the collection are administrative records of the New York State Prohibition Party; Prohibition literature, including periodicals and informational booklets; campaign materials, including brochures and leaflets; events materials, such as event programs and photographs of events; maps of the National Prohibition Park in Staten Island, as well as photographic and engraved portraits of prominent figures of the New York Prohibitionist movement.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The American Prohibition movement began in the mid-1800's and grew in influence and popularity until it achieved its greatest victory in 1918 with the passage of the 18th Amendment, which stated: "After one year from the ratification of this article, the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited." 1</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Never universally popular and a heralded example of the difficulty of legislating morality via the U.S. Constitution, the 18th Amendment was repealed by passage of the 21st Amendment in 1933.  The movement in New York fielded candidates for mayor of New York City and state governor, and a national party defined an issue platform and fielded candidates for President and Vice President of the U.S.. The enthusiasm with which the Prohibitionists embraced their cause can be seen in a quote from Clarence Elwyn Pitts, chairman of the Prohibition Central Committee in New York State, to a fellow Prohibitionist: "If we build wisely and well; sink personal differences into the commonweal; and plan carefully, we shall inaugurate a system of organization and development of work which will result in a mighty forward movement all over the state." 2</field>
