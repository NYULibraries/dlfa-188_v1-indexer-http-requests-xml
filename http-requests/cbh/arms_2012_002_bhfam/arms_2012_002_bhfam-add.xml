    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Brooklyn Home for Aged Men was founded by a group of wealthy Brooklyn women to provide housing and care for impoverished elderly men in 1877. It was officially incorporated in Feburary 27, 1878. The organization first secured temporary housing on Grand Avenue, before finding its first permanent residence at 84 State Street. That house was filled to capacity by 1880. By September 1886, property was acquired and ground was broken for a new residence home at 745 Classon Avenue. Residents were moved from the State Street home to Classon Avenue in May 1887. In 1893, a home on Park Place was acquired and joined to the organization's main building. In 1894, the Board of Managers decided to allow couples to be admitted to the Home, the first of which arrived in 1895. Later, single women would also admited to the Home. Additional buildings and medical facilities were constructed throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Home ceased operation as a residence in 1969, largely as a result of increased regulation of elderly care facilities. Current residents were transferred to other facilities. The Home's assets were sold, including real estate property (to the Interfaith Medical Center) and works of art. Funds from the sales were invested and are now used to support other elderly care facilities. The organization also provides scholarships for nursing students, and supports medical research.</field>
