    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The text-based and scrapbook material of accession 1977.146 forms the second series.  No inherent order was evident in this accession upon arrival, and in 2008 it was organized into five subseries: Personal Life, Death, Ephemera, Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, and Scrapbooks.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Personal Life subseries consists of correspondence and other materials, including Woodward's school report cards and military notices relating to John N. Woodward.   Very little personal correspondence was accessioned, with the notable exception of an 1861 letter to "Annie," Woodward's future wife.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">
The Death subseries consists of letters of condolence to Mrs. Elizabeth Woodward and clippings of obituaries or death notices from various newspapers in New York State.  Also see Scrapbook 4 for the like, including two brief Brazilian death notices.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Ephemera subseries consists of clippings, menus, and other ephemera.  The menus and seating charts form the bulk of the subseries, and were collected by Woodward from various dinners he attended.  A portion of the menus contain the autographs of other guests.  Many of the dinners were given by the New England Society or at the Brooklyn Club and/or as "complimentary dinners" to military personnel.  Also see Scrapbook 1 for Brooklyn City Guard and other menus, and see Scrapbook 2 for badges and other ephemera.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences subseries consists of material relating to the Institute and collected after Woodward's death, presumably by his daughter Mary.  All clippings mention Woodward, but the bulletin issues do not, with the notable exception of Vol. II, no. 18 (May 29, 1909), the cover of which is decorated by an engraving of Woodward.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Scrapbooks subseries consists of five scrapbooks.  Scrapbooks 1, 2, 3, and 5 were probably compiled by Woodward. Scrapbook 1 dates principally from the 1860s and includes Civil War era orders and other material concerning the New York National Guard's 13th Regiment. Scrapbooks 2 and 3 date mostly from the 1880s and 1890s and concern the organizations and political endeavors that Woodward participated in; political campaign ephemera, including ribbons and badges, are in the books. Scrapbook 5 dates from 1875 and consists of annotated printed clips of city council votes on city works. Scrapbook 4, which consists entirely of clippings relating to Woodward's illness, death, and memorials, was probably compiled by his wife, Elizabeth, or daughter, Mary. </field>
