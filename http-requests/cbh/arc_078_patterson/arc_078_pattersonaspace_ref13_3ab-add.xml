    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains a variety of photographic formats, including prints and negatives, daguerreotypes, tintypes, cartes de visite, and cabinet cards.  The photographs depict members of the Patterson family and their friends, though few photographs from the latter category contain identifications of the individuals pictured.  The photographs themselves are mostly formal portraits, some of which are in Prospect Park, though there are also a few candid photographs, particularly the negatives, which are all vacation photographs.  One of the posed portraits is of May at her law school graduation. The photographs have been divided by format and, aside from the prints, have all been physically placed with their respective format-based collections (daguerreotypes, tintypes, cartes de visite, and cabinet cards).  The prints are housed in Manuscript Box 3.</field>
