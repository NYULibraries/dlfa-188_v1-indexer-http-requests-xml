    <field name="bioghist_teim">Henry C. Morgan was born in Brooklyn in 1842, was the son of N.D. Morgan, President of the North America Life Insurance Company in New York, and the nephew of Edwin Denison Morgan, who served as Governor of New York and later was a United States Senator. Henry worked as clerk for the Manhattan Life Insurance Company before being enlisted to serve in the Civil War as a Recruiting Officer on October of 1861.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While recruiting service in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, Henry met his future wife, Augusta "Gussie" Parry. After being wounded in Virginia in 1864, requiring amputation of his left leg above the knee, Henry left service, and he and Augusta were married in April of 1865. The couple had three daughters and settled in Brooklyn on Clinton Street, later moving to Connecticut.</field>
