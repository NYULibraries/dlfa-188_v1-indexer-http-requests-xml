    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Wyckoff family was a Dutch family that settled in Brooklyn during the Dutch, then English, colonial period. Members of the Wyckoff family are all descended from Pieter Claesen Wyckoff, an influentual 17th century figure in New Amsterdam who established the Flatlands Dutch Reformed Church. After living near present day Albany, Claesen-Wyckoff and his wife, Grietje Van Ness-Wyckoff, settled on what is now the historic Wyckoff homestead in Flatlands, Brooklyn. While living on the Wyckoff homestead, Pieter Claesen Wyckoff became a landholder and justice of the peace. Claesen-Wyckoff and Van Ness-Wyckoff had eleven children who married other prominent families. The Wyckoff family tree is complex and spans the entire United States of America. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Wyckoff House &amp; Association, Inc. was formed in 1937 by descendants of Pieter Claesen Wyckoff and Grietje Van Ness-Wyckoff who came together to purchase the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House. In the 1960s, the Wyckoff House Foundation gained ownership of the property and donated it to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In 2001 the house was opened as a public museum offering school programs, public events, and community farmers markets. The Wyckoff House Museum perserves and educates the public from New York's oldest building through educational programs that connect people to the past.</field>
