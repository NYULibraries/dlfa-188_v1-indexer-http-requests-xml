    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection consists of fourteen 30 x 30 inch photographs of the interior of the Slave Theater. The Slave Theater was located at 1215 Fulton Street; it was closed when the NYC Department of Buildings condemned the building in early 2012. The Slave Theater (then the Regent Theater) was purchased by Judge John Phillips in 1982 who chose the name and had the interiors decorated with portraits of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr. and other prominent African American leaders to remind himself and his neighbors of their history. In the mid-1980's, following several racially motivated killings, the Reverend Al Sharpton began hosting weekly rallies and news conferences at the Slave Theater, making it a center for civil rights activities in New York City. The images were taken in 2010, at which point the theater had been unused for the past nine years. The images primarily depict artwork in the space, and the state of disrepair of the theater.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Slave Theater was located at 1215 Fulton Street; it was closed when the NYC Department of Buildings condemned the building in early 2012.  The Slave Theater (then the Regent Theater) was purchased by Judge John Phillips in 1982 who chose the name and had the interiors decorated with portraits of Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr. and other prominent African American leaders to remind himself and his neighbors of their history.  In the mid-1980's, following several racially motivated killings, the Reverend Al Sharpton began hosting weekly rallies and news conferences at the Slave Theater, making it a center for civil rights activities in New York City.  The Slave Theater effectively stopped operating in 1998.  By 2001, Judge Phillips was declared to be incompetent after gross mismanagement of his affairs was uncovered; that situation and his death in 2008 resulted in numerous legal and financial controversy.  In 2013, the Slave Theater was sold to a developer and demolished in 2016.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The photographs were taken by Japanese photographer Hiroki Kobayashi, who was living in Brooklyn at the time of the documentary project, but has since returned to Japan. His photographic work consists of Environmental portraiture, nature photography, and projects such as the Slave Theater series and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  More of his work can be seen at http://hirokikobayashi.com/. Some of the photographs have accompanied articles in the press about the Slave Theater and have been exhibited at Five Myles Gallery (2010), MoCADA (2011), and BRIC Rotunda Gallery (2013).  </field>
