    <field name="bioghist_teim">Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) was founded in 1863 as the Long Island Historical Society (LIHS). The founders of the Long Island Historical Society were among the city's most prominent citizens, whose families could trace their Brooklyn roots back to the 17th and 18th centuries. They established the Society as a library committed to preserving the history of America, New York State, and most especially, "the counties, towns and villages of Long Island."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Long Island Historical Society was initally located on Court Street in Brooklyn Heights, but relocated to 128 Pierrepont Street after the Society held a contest and selected renowned architect George Browne Post to design its headquarters. The magnificent landmark building designed by Post opened in 1881.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the 1970s and 1980s, the Society reestablished itself as a museum and education center. In 1985, it underwent a name to Brooklyn Historical Society. The Society also established a pioneering oral history program, reaching out to as-yet unchronicled Brooklyn communities and capturing their experiences. The Society also began featuring exhibits such as Black Churches in Brooklyn and AIDS/Brooklyn, the first exhibit to cover this topic at a history museum in the United States.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In October 1999, BHS undertook a full-scale restoration of its landmark building to create new exhibition space and climate-controlled storage for its valuable collections. In 2014, BHS completed a renovation of the first and lower levels.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Henry Reed Stiles (1832-1909) was a physician who authored a number of historical and genealogical works in the second half of the nineteenth and into the early twentieth centuries, including the 3 volume A History of the City of Brooklyn (1867-1870). Though his medical career took him to places as disparate as Dundee, Scotland and Woodbridge, New Jersey, Stiles lived most of his life in New York City and in Brooklyn. He was a founder of the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) in 1863 and served as the Society's first librarian. Further biographical information on Stiles can be found at his Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Reed_Stiles.</field>
