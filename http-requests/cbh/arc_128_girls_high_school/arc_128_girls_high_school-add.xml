    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Girls' High School collection spans the period 1890 to 1964 and contains ephemera, documents, photographs and publications documenting school events and student activities. Materials include programs for events; a collection of school songs; yearbooks; issues of the student-produced literary journal, Blue and Gold; issues of the school's newsletter, published under the titles The Chaser Fortnightly and The Fortnightly; and two volumes of poems written by students.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Girls' High School was Brooklyn's first all-girls high school, opening in 1886 on Nostrand Avenue between Macon and Halsey Streets in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. The school's distinctive building, borrowing from both neo-Gothic and French Second Empire architectural styles and featuring a prominent clock tower, was designed by architect James W. Naughton and was deemed a New York City landmark in 1983.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The school's predecessor was the Central Grammar School, a coeducational institution that was established in downtown Brooklyn at Court and Livingston Streets in 1878.  As Brooklyn's population grew, Central Grammar School became too small to accommodate the large number of new students, and the need for additional classroom facilities became apparent. Girls' High School was one of two public high schools established in response to this need, the other being Boys' High School, which opened in 1891 on Marcy Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Although Girls' High School closed in 1964, it later merged with Boys' High School and reopened in 1976 under its new name, Boys and Girls High School, at 1700 Fulton Street. As of 2023, the school continues to operate at that location.</field>
