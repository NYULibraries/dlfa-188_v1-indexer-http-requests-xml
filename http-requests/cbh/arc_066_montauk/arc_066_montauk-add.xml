    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1614, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block first encountered the Montauketts, one of the Algonquian-speaking groups who inhabited the area now known as Montauk, Long Island, N.Y. Not long after the "discovery" of Montauk by Block, Dutch and English settlers began to move there to farm, fish, and raise cattle. In the late 17th century, the Montauketts and the early English settlers, or, the Proprietors of Montauk, engaged in a series of land conveyances in which the proprietors of Montauk paid the Montauketts for land. Hand written documents were drawn up to record the exchanges between the Montauketts and the proprietors of Montauk.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1879, Arthur W. Benson (d. 1889) bought 10,000 acres of land in Montauk for $151,000. Benson, a businessman and land owner, was a founding owner of the Brooklyn Gas Light Company (1823) and was one of the original investors in the Brooklyn Bridge. He also owned farmland in what is now the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn that he divided into lots and sold individually.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Montauk, N.Y. is an unincorporated, census-designated area located in Suffolk County, Long Island and it is the easternmost census-designated place in New York state. The incorporated town of East Hampton, N.Y., located within Montauk, holds the designation of the easternmost town in New York State.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Gift of Mary Benson and Mrs. Thyrza Benson Flagg, 1918.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">On February 18, 1880, the Trustees of the Town of East Hampton passed a resolution at their town meeting authorizing Joseph S. Osborne, Town Clerk, to transfer to the then Proprietor of Montauk, Arthur W. Benson, the materials in this collection. On February 21, 1891, Osborne filed a reciept with the Town of East Hampton signed by Benson in which he acknowledged taking the deeds in to his custody. Benson died in 1889, and the materials in the collection were passed on to his heirs. In 1918 Mary Benson and Thyrza Benson Flagg, grand daughters of Arthur Benson, donated the deeds to the Long Island Historical Society, now named the Brooklyn Historical Society.</field>
