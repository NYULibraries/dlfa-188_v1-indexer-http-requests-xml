    <field name="bioghist_teim">Anthony Jansen (Janszoon) Van Salee (1607 – 1667), also called Anthony from Salee, Vaes, or Fez, was the first known person of Muslim origin in the Americas. Arriving in New Netherland in 1630, he was one of the earliest settlers and landowners in the Dutch West India Company colony and one of the largest landowners in what is today Brooklyn. Anthony's father, Jan Jansen, was a Dutch privateer who married a Moorish woman in Cartagena, Spain. Anthony was their fourth son. In 1618, Jan Jansen was captured by one of the Moorish states along the Barbary coast. During his captivity in Algiers, Jan Jansen reportedly converted to Islam, possibly by force, and, renamed Admiral Murat Reis, became one of the famed Barbary pirates. During this time, Jansen moved his family to Salé, then Algiers, and then Amsterdam. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">At the end of 1629, a 22-year old Anthony Jansen Van Salee set sail for the New World from Amsterdam. With him was his new wife, Grietje Reyniers, a 27 year-old woman of German descent. By 1638, the couple had established a bouwery (farm) just north of the city wall, also known as Wall Street. A year later, they would enter into a series of legal disputes with significant ramifications in a small community in which justice was often determined by personal connections, accusations, and slander. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">What began as an accusation of debt by Domine Bogardus of the Dutch Reform Church escalated into a series of allegations centering on the lasciviousness of Grietje. Anthony fought back with countersuits and threats, while Grietje turned the tables, accusing Bogardus' wife of similarly scandalous behavior. Resident after resident, many of them friends with Domine Bogardus and members of the Dutch Reform Church, swore petitions against Grietje and Anthony. Ultimately, Director-General Kieft made an unusual decision – he gave the couple six months to leave New Amsterdam forever. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On August 3, 1639, Director-General Kieft approved Van Salee his petition for 100 morgens on the western end of Long Island, near Coney Island in the present-day area of New Utrecht and Gravesend.  Anthony and Grietje left New Amsterdam, crossing the river to the largely unsettled area at the western tip of Long Island. Over the next several decades, they established themselves as one of the most prosperous landowning families in the area. Despite their banishment, Anthony continued to own property in New Amsterdam and to serve as a prosperous merchant and creditor in the small but growing city. The couple had several daughters, who went on to marry into prominent merchant families. Many families, including the Vanderbilts, proudly trace their lineage back to the Van Salees. </field>
