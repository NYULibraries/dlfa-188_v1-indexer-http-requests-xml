    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">circa 1900-1939</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Eugene L. Armbruster photographs and scrapbooks date from 1900 to 1939. The collection is comprised of 7 bound scrapbooks, approximately 300 loose scrapbook pages, and 4,422 photographic prints.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographic prints (3.5" x 4.5") in accession V1974.001 are documentary in nature and depict homes, landscapes, churches, and other buildings throughout Brooklyn. Armbruster inscribes notes on many of the photographs with details pertaining to the location or significant events to the building's history (i.e. demolition date).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The scrapbooks in accession V1974.022 feature street scenes, buildings, churches, and estates in Brooklyn, but also showcase Manhattan, Queens, Nassau County and Suffolk County. Many of the images depict buildings and structures no longer in existence and include annotated notes about the building on the scrapbook page. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Infrastructure, change, destruction, and news events are ongoing themes throughout the scrapbook pages. The scrapbooks were likely used as a resources for Armbruster's published books and not created to be shared. Many of the hand-drawn maps and drawings, as well as transcribed texts are replicated in his published work. He includes annotated notes on each page when the buildings was built and when it was torn down or changed ownership. Maritime and recreational boating history is featured prominently in the scrapbooks with many images of coastal scenes and infrastructure, such as lighthouses, sailboats, and boat docks.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also worth noting is the numerous scrapbook pages documenting destruction caused by fire, including factory fires, personal homes, and Steeplechase Park in Coney Island. In addition to fires, other current events are seen recorded throughout the pages including the opening of the New York City subway, and the sinking of the ship General Slocum (1891). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Unlike the other scrapbooks, the Coney Island pages include people, particularly people at play. Highlights include public beaches, Luna Park, exotic animals, and disaster spectacles (Fighting the Flames, Mont Pelee, Galveston Flood). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The U.S. military base at Hempstead Plains is featured in the Views of Nassau County scrapbook and includes images of Camp Black, a camp that trained soldiers to fight in the Spanish-American War, and the Mitchel Air Force Base, active 1918-1961.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notable landmarks in Views of Kings County scrapbook include City Hall, Fulton Ferry, Grand Opera House, Packer mansion, Shubert Theater, and Wallabout Market. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notable landmarks in NYC &amp; Her Neighbors scrapbooks include Grand Central Station, City Hall, St. Mark's Church, Ellis Island, Green-wood Cemetery, Fraunces Tavern, Gansevort Market, Metropolitan Museum, High Bridge, Lord &amp; Taylor's, Mutual Life Building, Plaza Hotel, and Trinity Church.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Eugene L. Armbruster was born in Baden-Baden, Germany in 1865. In 1882, he immigrated to New York City and lived in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn until his death in 1943. He and his family were long-time residents of Eldert Street. He worked (and appeared to have some stake in) the H. Henkel Cigar Box Manufacturing Company until his retirement in 1920. Following retirement, Armbruster became an amateur photographer and local historian writing for the "Old-Timer" column of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle and published pamphlets about local history. In the column, he answered questions related to homes and properties throughout Brooklyn.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The majority of his photographs and scrapbooks were created in the 1910s and 1920s. Through his photographs, scrapbooks,  clippings, and annotations, Armbruster seemed particularly interested in infrastructure and preserving history that he viewed as vanishing during a period of rapid growth and change in Brooklyn. In his book, The Eastern District of Brooklyn (1912), he writes, "If a history of the City of New York will ever be written, its compiler will look around for historical matter relating to the old towns, now forming parts of the metropolis, and this book was written that the Eastern District of Brooklyn may be represented then."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Armbruster was a voracious reader of New York City histories and walked extensively throughout Brooklyn and beyond, photographing buildings and landscapes, a majority of which he annotated with historic information. The photographs primarily feature Brooklyn, but also showcase Manhattan, Queens, Nassau County and Suffolk County. Between 1914 and 1929, Armbruster published several pamphlets about local history including hand-drawn maps, drawings, original photographs and newspaper clippings. His published books focus on the history of Brooklyn from Dutch settlement in the 17th century to the early 20th century.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Armbruster developed cataracts late in life, which prevented him from continuing his photographic work. He died on September 21, 1943 at the age of seventy-eight.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">There is no accession record on file, but the bulk of the collection (described as accession V1974.001 and V1974.022) was likely purchased from Sally Armbruster, Eugene Armbruster's daughter, at an unknown date (circa 1940s).</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The photographs described as accession V1974.032 were at one point removed from the Brooklyn Historical Society's "Brooklyn Files."</field>
