    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Rotary Club of Brooklyn was founded in 1914 as a local arm of Rotary International. The club's various committees, such as cultural, welfare, community safety, and community service, contributed to the organization's overall goal of improving the surrounding community through service and providing a productive social group for local businessmen and professionals. After a drop in membership in the 1970s, the Brooklyn club rebuilt itself in the late 1990s and continues serving the residents of the borough as of 2010.</field>
