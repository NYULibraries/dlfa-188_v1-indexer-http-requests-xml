    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This sub-series contains assorted materials from Packer Collegiate Institute's President Dr. Paul Shafer, 1938 â€“ 1968.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The first group of materials consists of speeches delivered to students, faculty, parents and/or alumni by Dr. Shafer between 1930-1953. The speeches address WWII and its impact on education. Speeches following WWII are addressed to the PTA and focus on education within the home. Two examples of Shafer's writings appear in print outside of the Packer community: Forbes Magazine and Vital Speeches of the Day. A large formal document, with the signature and official seal of New York City's Mayor, Fiorello H. LaGuardia, and names Shafer a trustee of the Brooklyn Public Library. Shafer's 1967 announcement of his retirement is also included in the series by the Alumni Association. Materials are in good condition, although, Vital Speeches of the Day magazine's condition is deteriorating and should be handled with care.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The secound group of material consists of Dr. Shafer's office files. Arranged in rough chronological order for the academic years between 1960-1967. Folders include: Annual Report, Daily Program, Finances, School Organization and Administration and Teacher Reports. Items within this group detail Dr. Shafer's philosophy of education, his leadership style and his thoughts regarding topical issues pertaining to the school as a whole. The format of materials ranges from printed programs to handwritten notes on 4 x 7 colored note cards.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Annual Report folders contain President Shafer's notes in preparation of his reports to the Board of Trustees. The Daily Program folders contain Dr. Shafer's notes for addresses to groups including the Board of Trustees, faculty, and students at the beginning of the each school year.

There are minutes from meetings of the Board, and there are lists such as, "Colleges entered by graduates of the Academic School."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Finance Reports are inconsistent between 1960 and 1968. The Treasurer of the Board of Trustees is responsible for delivering these reports detailing school expenses for events such as theater performances or the Spring Concert.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The School Administration and Organization folders contain items dealing with campus life and the President's responsibilities. Some items are related to the faculty such as a description of the school's Major Medical Insurance policy coverage and a list of new teachers, or instructions, such as "Procedures for Examinations." Some items detail student life, for example Permission Slip forms for a school dance or a directive regarding the lapsed enforcement of rules prohibiting girls from leaving school between the times of arrival and dismissal. Miscellaneous items include air raid drill instructions and a list of families with two or more children in the school.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Teachers' Report folders are comprised of evaluations by faculty members, reports on the activities school clubs and reports from the dean and department heads. Among the materials are mimeographed examples of class assignments and exams.</field>
