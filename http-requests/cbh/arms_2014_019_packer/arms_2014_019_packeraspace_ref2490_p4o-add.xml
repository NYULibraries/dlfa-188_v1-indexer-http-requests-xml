    <field name="bioghist_teim">Elizabeth Post Morrow (1896-1992), the daughter of James Howell Post (President of the National Sugar Refinery) and Louisa Henderson Wells, was a student at the Packer Collegiate Institute, graduating in 1916. Her mother was also a Packer Institute Alumna (class of 1880), as was her daughter Betsey (class of 1943). As a student, Elizabeth Post was active in Glee Club, school plays and debates. She also was active in the Student Settlement Association. She lived in Brooklyn Heights after graduation (Remsen Street), and from the evidence of programs in her papers; she continued to attend Packer functions in the decades following her graduation. She married Thomas Morrow in 1920 and was identified as a philanthropist in a newspaper clipping found in one of her hymnals. She was Vice President of the Associate Alumnae of the Packer Collegiate Institute (years unknown). In 1937 she was appointed to the Packer Collegiate Institute Board of Trustees as the representative of the Association of Alumni. In the same clipping mentioned above, it was noted that she was the 6th woman appointed to the board, and her role was to help bring Packer policies in line with other similar educational institutions. Some time in the 1920s Elizabeth and Thomas Morrow established a homestead in Brookhaven, Long Island, where the Morrow family had formerly lived. The Post-Morrow Homestead in Brookhaven has become the headquarters of the Post Morrow Foundation, which was established by Elizabeth and Thomas to help preserve the rural character of Brookhaven and its surrounding areas in Suffolk County. Well into the 1970s Mrs. Morrow continued to give regularly, and often generously, to Packer funds.</field>
