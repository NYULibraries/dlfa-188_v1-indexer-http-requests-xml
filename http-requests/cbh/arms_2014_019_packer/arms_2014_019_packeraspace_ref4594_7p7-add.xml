    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The sub-series contains a substantial amount of photographs documenting life at Packer, dating from circa 1850 to circa 2010. It is primarily composed of prints, but also includes negatives (especially for photographs dating from the 1980s to 2000s), contact sheets, digital images, and other photographic mediums.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Thematically, the photographs cover various aspects of student life, including class work, arts, sports, class trips, special events, and extracurricular activities. It also documents the interior and exterior of Packer's building through the years.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs were used for a variety of purposes, including the school's yearbook and various school publications.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Please note: many file descriptions include a five-digit, hyphenated number as part of the file description. These numbers are formatted XX-YYY, in which XX is a year indicator and YYY a sequential indicator. Thus, 98-002 indicates that the envelope is labeled as being from 1998, and is the second sequentially in its order, after 98-001 and before 98-003. These numbers were found on the envelopes in which the photographs were stored, and have been preserved to aid in the location of materials. However, they should be relied upon only with the understanding that not all photograph envelopes came with such a number, and thus the sequential ordering should be considered in no way absolute. In the instance that two photograph envelopes were found to possess the same numerical code, the two envelopes were designated within the file descriptions as variants (A) and (B) of the same five-digit code (ex: 98-002A and 98-002B).</field>
