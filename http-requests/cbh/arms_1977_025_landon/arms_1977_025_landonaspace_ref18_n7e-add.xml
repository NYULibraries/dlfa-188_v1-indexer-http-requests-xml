    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of Correspondence is directed to Henry Landon concerning various legal, business, political, and New York State legislative matters. Among the letters to Henry concerning national political affairs are those from U.S. Congressmen Abel Huntington (1834) and Charles A. Floyd (1842). Among the letters concerning local political and legislative matters is an 1847 letter from the Sag Harbor trustees to Henry, in his capacity as State Assemblyman, proposing legislative amendments to Sag Harbor's act of incorporation. Correspondence concerning Landon's dealings with the Long Island Rail Road in connection with land acquisition is in the series. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes correspondence between Jared Landon and his father, Samuel, from the period in which Samuel was a refugee in Connecticut during the British occupation of New York City. The series includes Jared's 1778 petition for release from military prison. Several pieces refer to wartime hardships on Long Island. Other correspondence to Jared includes an 1814 letter from U.S. Congressman Ebenezer Sage in which Sage expresses his fear that Britain intends to recolonize America.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other correspondents include, among others, Phineas Corey, David Conkling, Stephen Conkling, Joshua Fleet, and Daniel Osborn. The series includes correspondence of 1862-63 to Colonel W.B. Barton, commander of the 48th Regiment of New York State Volunteers in South Carolina, from Confederate commanders regarding movements under flags of truce. An 1836 document to Henry describes the facts of a case to be decided in which an African-American girl of about 10, originally bound by her mother to a Mr. Smith, sought to remain bound to Smith, rather than be taken away by her brothers upon the death of her mother. The series also includes an undated circular letter from "The Ladies" giving playful encouragement to the public speaking endeavors of the "Younger Members" of the Cutchogue Young Men's Debating Society. In addition to the commercial, legal, and political matters that predominate in the series, some of the correspondence is also concerned, at least in part, with matters of health and religious fervor.</field>
