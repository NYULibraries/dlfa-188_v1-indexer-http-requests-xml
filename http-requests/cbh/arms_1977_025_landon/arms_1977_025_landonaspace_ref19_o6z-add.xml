    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Financial Records generally consists of material from the late 1700s that concerns estate cases handled by Jared Landon and from circa 1820-1860 that concerns various financial matters of Henry Landon. Formats include day books, ledgers, vendue (auction) accounts, inventories, promissory notes, account statements, receipts, invoices, sales agreements, and the like.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For the late 1700s, the series consists of an extensive set of business and estate settlement records for merchant David Conkling of Southold, deceased 1787. Records of two other Conklings, Stephen and Joseph, are also found with David's estate records, for which Jared Landon and Stephen were co-executors. There are several account books (i.e., day books, ledgers, journals) in the series; although most cannot be directly traced to an owner, it is possible that some of these relate to David Conkling. Conkling-related documents include those concerning the Conkling-owned sloop Seaflower. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other financial records from the late 1700s and early 1800s likely concern Jared Landon personally or were related to other professional matters he worked on, but these are less clear and less extensive than material directly associated with the Conklings. Among these documents is a 1790 receipt for a subscription to the Gazette of the United States, signed by John Fenno.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The material holds several documents related to African-Americans. Various day books, journals, and transaction documents contain references to African-Americans executing transactions on behalf of others or for themselves, including transactions with the Conkling estate. The series includes a 1793 levy from a collector indicating that a "negro boy" would be taken in partial payment of an assessment for street improvements.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">From circa 1820 to 1860, the series includes extensive financial records of Henry Landon. These records primarily concern his personal affairs, most notably a detailed account book for the period 1815 to 1853. The miscellaneous financial documents consist of standalone items whose salient features consist of calculations, accounts, and other numbers-oriented notes. Records of expenses incurred on travel, weights of hogs, value of fish taken, bushels of produce, and other such data can be found in Henry's records.</field>
