    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Nehemiah Denton papers consist of more than 300 items in manuscript form relating to the personal and business concerns of Denton. The time period covered is from 1785 to 1844, with a major portion of the collection dating from late 1830 to 1844. The bulk of the material in the collection is in the form of bills, receipts and account books. They are significant in their documentation of the diverse business affairs of Denton. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Items of special interest in this collection include a license to use the patented milling machinery designed by Oliver Evans, with a diagram of the machine on the back. A bill of sale dated 1808 shows the purchase of a sixteen year old African-American boy for $80. His property records include a deed for land in Flatbush purchased by Leffert Lefferts, a lease for property in the Village of Brooklyn, as well as an agreement made to sell part of his land in the City of Brooklyn to H. Shephard Moat and James E. Underhill. Among the account books is one detailing the names and amounts paid by pew renters of the Dutch Reformed Church in Brooklyn from 1819 to 1826. Other account books include information on various purchases needed to run his milling business. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Three items refer to Denton's brother, Samuel, who died in 1799. Three others concern William Skidmore of Greenwich, a cousin.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Nehemiah Denton (1773-1844) was born in Jamaica, N.Y., the third son of Thomas Denton and his wife, Mary Skidmore. His family descended from Rev. Richard Denton who came to Hempstead, L.I. in 1650. He was related to Daniel Denton, one of the first settlers of Jamaica, whose Brief Description of New York, Formerly New Amsterdam (1670) is one of the earliest accounts published. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Denton married Elizabeth Carpenter in 1797; they had two daughters. Elizabeth and both daughters were dead by 1837 and Denton married Janet Hogarth in 1839. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Although members of his family were among the founding members of the Presbyterian Church in this country, Denton attended the Dutch Reformed church in Brooklyn. He was appointed Elder in 1824 and served for many years. Denton's name appears in the Brooklyn City Directories in the 1820s and 1830s as an assessor for the Town of Brooklyn and as a commissioner of highways. In 1824, he became a director of the first bank in Brooklyn, the Long Island Bank, and served in that capacity for many years. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to his business as a miller in Gowanus, Denton was a merchant in New York. He and his partner, Benjamin Smith, owned Denton and Smith at 25 Coenties Slip. He also owned land in downtown Brooklyn on which he built houses for speculation. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Denton died in 1844. He left as his heir his grandson, Nehemiah Denton Wilkins. He was buried in the family plot at the Prospect Cemetery in Jamaica. </field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The Nehemiah Denton papers were acquired by the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society) through donation from Warren H. Smith in 1953.</field>
