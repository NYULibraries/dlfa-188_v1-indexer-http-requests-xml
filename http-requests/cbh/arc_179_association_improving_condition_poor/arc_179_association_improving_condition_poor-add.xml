    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Brooklyn Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor was founded in 1843.  For the first several decades of its existence, the Association based its operations at several temporary locations throughout the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Heights and Downtown Brooklyn.  Its first permanent offices were established in 1884 at 104 Livingston Street, and were relocated to 401 State Street in 1926.  The aim of the Association's work was to improve the physical and moral condition of Brooklyn's poor population.  Its early services included the distribution of alms, food, and clothing, as well as the providing of employment.  As the Association grew, it extended its services and established specialized departments, including a school for the blind, an orthopedic ward, health and dental centers, and a home-making center.  The Association also published The Brooklyn Charities Record and Directory, which included information about charitable activities in Brooklyn and contained listings of other charitable organizations.</field>
