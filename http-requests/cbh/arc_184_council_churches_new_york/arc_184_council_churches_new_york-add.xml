    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Council of Churches of the City of New York collection dates from 1947 to 1985 and measures 0.62 linear feet. The collection contains material from the Council of Churches and its Brooklyn Division, as well as predecessor organizations, the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation and the Protestant Council of the City of New York.

Meeting minutes originate from the Board of Directors of the Protestant Council's Brooklyn Division and Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation, and date from 1953 to 1960. Reports provide financial data as well as a summary of the activities and programs coordinated by the Protestant Council's Brooklyn Division, dating from 1953 to 1963. The bulk of the collection contains newsletters, spanning the date range of the collection, from the Protestant Council (Protestant Church Life and Metropolitan Church Life), the Council of Churches (Metropolitan Church News), and the Council of Church's Brooklyn Division (Brooklyn Division Newsletter).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Council of Churches of the City of New York was founded in 1895 as the New York Federation of Churches and Christian Workers and renamed the Protestant Council of the City of New York in 1943. The Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation (originally formed as the Brooklyn City Tract Society in 1829) merged with the Protestant Council in 1946 to become the Brooklyn Division of the Protestant Council. The Brooklyn Division consolidated the various social services and mission work provided by churches, promoted interfaith church unity, and aimed to strengthen churches in the borough at a time when the Protestant population was shrinking. In 1968, The Protestant Council was renamed the Council of Churches of the City of New York. As of 2011, the Council of Churches still operates as an interdenominational organization and church council that advocates for issues affecting church members.</field>
