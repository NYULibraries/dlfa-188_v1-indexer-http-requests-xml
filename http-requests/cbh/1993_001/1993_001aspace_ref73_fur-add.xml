    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, William Sandoval speaks about the spread of the epidemic through Brooklyn neighborhoods, particularly Sunset Park. Sandoval compares Brooklyn and other parts of the city through his experience in AIDS organizations. He makes observations about the differences between Brooklyn and Manhattan physicians treating people with AIDS. Sandoval and his sister Rita Rodriguez recall their upbringing, Sandoval's drug use, and how the family has responded to his illness. They discuss how treatment can be improved and how awareness can address the stigma associated with the virus. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">When interviewed in 1992, William (Willie) Sandoval was a 41 year old Latino person with AIDS who was infected with the HIV virus through IV drug use. He grew up in South Brooklyn, one of nine siblings with a violent and alcoholic father. Sandoval lived in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn as an adult. He was diagnosed in 1988 after being hospitalized for a series of illnesses and psychiatric episodes associated with AIDS. Sandoval then lived at his sister's home in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn. By 1992, he was often staying in the Lutheran Medical Center's AIDS ward. Sandoval was active in a number of organizations: ACT UP, Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC), church and education groups. Sandoval had to be less involved in these groups because of his health. He died on September 26, 1992 of complications due to AIDS. His sister, Rita Rodriguez, was 43 years old at the time of the interview, and moved out of Brooklyn in 1993.</field>
