    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Beverly Rotter, Melissa De La Cruz, and Randy Rotter are interviewed as a family group. They discuss Iris De La Cruz (1954 - 1991) and the powerful mark she made on the world as an AIDS activist, sex worker activist, and writer. They talk about her life and work before HIV and after. Each one remarks on Iris's humor, kindness, and fierceness as an activist. Melissa talks about what it was like to have Iris as her mother. Randy discusses bonding with Iris through humor, and also his anger around her HIV infection. Beverly speaks about being a caregiver and the work that it takes to advocate for someone. Each also speaks about their own understanding of HIV/AIDS before Iris seroconverted (when HIV antibodies are detected) and after. Criticizing stigma and discrimination of people with HIV/AIDS, Beverly Rotter tells the interviewer that their line of questioning is inappropriate and lets him know she will not continue in that direction. Interview conducted by Robert Rosenberg.</field>
