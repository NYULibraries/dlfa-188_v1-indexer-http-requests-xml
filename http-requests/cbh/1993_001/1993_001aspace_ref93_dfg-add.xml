    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, Marilyn John speaks about the changes she has witnessed within Caribbean communities, particularly with regards to sexuality, because of the AIDS crisis. John brings to the conversation her experience from within the Caribbean community, as well as a background and interest in community health. Throughout the course of the interview, John talks about the need for a holistic approach to health (Holistic Methods of Intervention), specifically with a focus on culture and immigration. She also talks about the need for Caribbean-specific cultural training related to HIV. Since her primary interest is in education, she concentrates on the approaches she takes to address different needs and characteristics of the communities she works with. Finally, she outlines what should be done for Brooklyn's Caribbean communities. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</field>
