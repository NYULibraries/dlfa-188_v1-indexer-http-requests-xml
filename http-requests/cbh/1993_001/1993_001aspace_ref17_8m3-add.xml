    <field name="bioghist_teim">At the time of this 1993 interview, Kristy Fernandes was a seven year old girl who had been diagnosed with AIDS two years prior. Kristy's father, Carney Fernandes, was 55 years old at the time of the interview. Carney Fernandes was an immigrant from Guyana and had tested negative for HIV. He had been caring for his daughter on his own since her mother's death in the late 1980s. Upon learning of his daughter's HIV status he went back to school to become a nurse. Kristy was aware of her diagnosis and able to keep up with her school work and had only minor limitations on her daily life. They lived together in an apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.</field>
