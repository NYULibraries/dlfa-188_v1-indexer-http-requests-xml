    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, Philip Coleman talks about the impact that AIDS has had on the Black gay community and on his life. He speaks about what love, sex and relationships have come to mean to him as a PWA. He makes some observations about gay PWAs living in Brooklyn, based on the experiences he had in his support group. Coleman shares his thoughts and feelings rooted in the intersectional experience of being Black, gay, and living with HIV throughout the interview. He talks about what he thinks was needed in terms of activism and services, and how racism and homophobia play out in church, in community, and elsewhere. Throughout the interview, Coleman connects the work he does around his being a gay Black man living with HIV to issues such as ageism, the house music and ballroom dance scenes, and even overlapping activism as it related to Haiti. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</field>
