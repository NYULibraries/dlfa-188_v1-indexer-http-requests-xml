    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, Ivan Keith Weinstein discusses his experience as a gay man living with HIV in Brooklyn with a partner in the early 1990s. He discusses his opinion on the difference between living with HIV versus getting an AIDS diagnosis; his partner not wanting to disclose his HIV positive status; the lack of good services for people living with HIV in Brooklyn; and the impact that living with HIV has had on his personal relationships, work, sex life, and interactions with the medical profession. Towards the end of the interview, a different interviewer comes in and prompts Weinstein to discuss the first person he knew with HIV in Brooklyn and the differences in stigma and care in Manhattan versus Brooklyn. Most of the interview was conducted by Robert Rosenberg.</field>
