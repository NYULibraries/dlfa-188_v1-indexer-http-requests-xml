    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dolores Rivera, a 51 year old Irish and African American woman, was diagnosed with AIDS after having pneumocystis pneumonia in 1986. Rivera was raised in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn. Aside from briefly living in Staten Island, Rivera only lived in Brooklyn. Rivera began using drugs when she was 36 years old after her children were all young adults and was homeless for a period of time. She believed she was infected with HIV through IV drug use, although she knew that her last sexual encounter was with a man who had the virus. After her diagnosis, she went into rehab and began outreach work within the Brooklyn IV drug-using community. When this interview took place in 1992, she had an apartment in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn. Rivera was babysitting her granddaughter while this interview was recorded. After this interview, Rivera served on the Board of Directors at Iris House. She died in 2004.</field>
