    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mildred Pearson was an African American woman from the Boerum Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn. She was 61 years old and living in Williamsburg at the time of the interview. Pearson lived at Cooper Park public housing where she and her husband Rutledge raised 14 children. Her experience as a mother of a gay son who died of AIDS prompted her to join the Brooklyn AIDS Task Force (BATF). Pearson left BATF to establish a support group for mothers of people with AIDS (Mother's Love) when she realized more needed to be done to meet the emotional stress experienced by people with AIDS and their families. Mother's Love had weekly meetings for its members/mothers who also did outreach work in Brooklyn and the other boroughs. Mildred Pearson died in April 1994.</field>
