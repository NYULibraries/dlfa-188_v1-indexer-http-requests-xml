    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, Melinda Broman provides information about her experience as a heterosexual woman within a straight relationship dealing with HIV/AIDS. She speaks about the lack of support within the AIDS movement and also the lack of support from the hemophiliac community. Broman made friends with gay men active in the AIDS movement, but did not always feel she was getting the support she needed. It was different within the community of people with hemophilia. She felt that fear of HIV/AIDS made the virus an unwanted topic of discussion. Melinda Broman also speaks about being in a serodiscordant couple and how it related to handling her own non-HIV-related health issues. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Melinda Broman, a white woman, was 47 years old when she was interviewed. Her husband Victor Ockey, who had hemophilia, died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1989. He was infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during a routine blood transfusion in the early 1980s. At the time of this interview, Broman had lived in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill neighborhood since the mid-1980s. Broman's involvement with AIDS was extensive, reaching beyond her relationship with her husband. As a member of the National Hemophilia Foundation she has lobbied for increased awareness of the specific plight of HIV+ hemophiliacs. Through her work as a psychologist at Downstate Medical Center and as a member of the Brooklyn Psychological Association she has organized AIDS workshops. She was interviewed primarily because of her personal and professional experience with AIDS issues specific to people with hemophilia.</field>
