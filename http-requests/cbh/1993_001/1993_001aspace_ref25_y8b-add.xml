    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the interview, Christopher Henry speaks of AIDS from the position of a young gay man of color living in a city. He is conscious of the role race and ethnicity play in understanding the issues raised by the AIDS crisis. He describes his mother's reaction to his HIV positive status and interactions with gay friends. Henry provides insights into the views of people impacted by HIV in Brooklyn related to the systemic issues of HIV/AIDS. He speaks about HIV being created by the government as well as how the government's inaction impacts care. He talks about the ignorance he sees within his own Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights. He discusses the virus in the contexts of spirituality, gay rights, and race. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Christopher Henry, a gay African American man, tested positive for HIV four years before this interview. This was discovered a few weeks before his cousin, who was also gay, died from AIDS. He moved from his family home in the Bronx into his cousin's house in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1991. Apart from attending support groups at Woodhull Hospital, Henry was not involved with AIDS-related organizations or activities at the time of the interview. Henry did not consider himself an activist because he did not carry banners. Instead, Henry saw himself more as a public intellectual in the making, akin to a celebrity or "public official." He was close to family, had a sense of community, and was raised with a Christian foundation.</field>
