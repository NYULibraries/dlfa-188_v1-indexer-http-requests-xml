    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this second of four interviews, Robert MacCrate discusses his time as general counsel to Nelson Rockefeller. He spends much of this section discussing his role in the re-structuring of the public higher education system in New York State. He also talks about his role in reorganizing the court system in the state. He provides insight into the politicking and importance of compromise that is integral to government. MacCrate then moves into a discussion about the history of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. He recalls his role in investigating the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. He details how he was contacted by the Army, and the background of My Lai. He talks about the trip he took to Vietnam, and the process of the investigation itself as well as the report he published and its repercussions. Within the final hour, MacCrate reads a lengthy speech, first delivered in 1971, about My Lai and his views on war. Interview conducted by Sady Sullivan.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Robert MacCrate was born in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1921. After attending Harvard Law School, he got a job at Sullivan and Cromwell law firm in New York, and moved to Long Island. Beginning in 1958 he worked as counsel to Governor Rockefeller until 1962. During this time he was heavily involved in the expansion of the State University of New York system, as well as engineering the modernization of state courts and redrawing a number of congressional district borders in New York City in order to increase representation for minority communities. He then moved back to Long Island and resumed work at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, where he was involved in a large number of international corporate cases and traveled widely. In 1969 he was asked to be involved in an investigation of the My Lai massacre and filed the report which ended up being the impetus for bringing charges against a number of soldiers for their actions in Vietnam. He and his assistant were the only civilians involved in the investigation. He was living on Long Island with his wife when the interview occurred in 2007. Robert MacCrate and his wife Constance both died in 2016, and were survived by three children.</field>
