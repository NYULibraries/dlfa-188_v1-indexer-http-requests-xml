    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this first of four interviews, Robert MacCrate recollects the life of his grandparents and for a long period, tells the life-story of his father, who was a Brooklyn based lawyer and later, congressman and federal judge. He moves into a discussion of his own time in college and recounts the ways in which his life has been intertwined with a friend from Haverford. MacCrate describes his first job at the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell law firm and his move back to New York City from Harvard in Boston. He also mentions that in 1959 he became the general counsel to the Governor of New York. MacCrate discusses what is popularly—although unfairly, according to him—called "The MacCrate Report," which was released by The American Bar Association Task Force on Law Schools and the Profession (which he chaired). Interview conducted by Sady Sullivan.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Robert MacCrate was born in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1921. He attended high school at Brooklyn Friends School, and then moved on to Haverford College. After his time at Haverford, he had a brief stint in the Navy serving in the Pacific theater of World War II, and then attended Harvard Law School, where he met his wife, Constance Trapp. From Harvard, he got a job at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in New York, and moved to Long Island. Beginning in 1958 he worked as counsel to the Governor of New York (Nelson Rockefeller) until 1962. During this time he was heavily involved in the expansion of the State University of New York system. He chaired the American Bar Association Task Force on Law Schools and the Profession, which in 1992 issued what is popularly known today as "The MacCrate Report," which discussed the state of legal education in the United States and stressed the importance of practical experience over purely theoretical learning. It has had a large impact on the way law is taught in the U.S. and abroad. He was living on Long Island with his wife when the interview occurred in 2007. Robert and Constance MacCrate both died in 2016, and were survived by three children.</field>
