    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Martha "Marty" Rubin remembers some features of Brooklyn neighborhoods, in particular how they had developed and survived more polluted periods. She recommends narrators that could also speak to Brooklyn heritage and landmarks, and this leads into her description of some community activism to alter the path of the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. Rubin recalls her first encounter with Brooklyn and how her family has thrived there. She goes back to her own childhood; describing Abilene, Texas, her father's respect for science—particularly Darwin's writing—and her mother's stereotypical "ladylike" sensibilities. Rubin tells her experiences of higher education, including time at Occidental College and Radcliffe, as well as debating whether a graduate degree in archaeology or anthropology was best for her. She talks about the formation of Saint Ann's School as a private institution and the many ways her family has been part of it. In closing, she remembers the thrill of first owning a home and discovering community in Brooklyn, and how the borough dodged the skyscraper boom of Manhattan. Interview conducted by Sady Sullivan.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Martha "Marty" Rubin was born in 1932 and raised in Abilene, Texas. Her father, Homer Hastings Adams was a geologist who started an oil business in Rubin's youth. When she was fifteen with one younger sister, her father died and her mother, Mildred Grizzard, ran the business. Rubin attended Occidental College in California, graduating in 1954, and Radcliffe's graduate business classes in 1955. Robert "Bob" Rubin was also at Radcliffe and the two became a couple. They married and had four children. The family had been in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights for over fifty years when this interview took place in 2009. The Rubins became founders of the private Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights, with Bob serving as treasurer and Marty teaching history, anthropology, and some geography. Marty Rubin also served on the board of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for many years. In 1993, her book Countryside, Garden and Table was published. Rubin died in February, 2017. Her family had grown to include seven grandchildren.</field>
