    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Prospect Lefferts Gardens Neighborhood Association (PLGNA) was founded in 1968 by Robert Thomason and a coalition of ministers looking to improve the quality of life for residents in the Prospect Lefferts Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.

Through the 1970s, PLGNA and East Flatbush residents fought redlining in the neighborhood to promote a diversity of residents and effectively organized to ensure local banks invested directly into the community. From 1983 through 1994, PLGNA received grants from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development for neighborhood preservation and redevelopment programs. Activities included revitalizing the commercial corridor, organizing street clean-ups, enlisting community members in a mobile patrol, and providing consultation to community members on housing technical assistance, including tenant court representation, block and tenant association organizing, and housing rehabilitation. PLGNA worked to get all city-owned abandoned buildings onto the market, either through private development or through a combination of private and public funding.  </field>

In 1994, PLGNA lost funding from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal for breaching their contract agreement. PLGNA could no longer afford to pay its staff and closed its offices on Flatbush Avenue, suspending activities for the latter half of the 1990s. In 2000, Thomason and a group of ministers led by Reverend Ronald Winley organized to revive the organization. PLGNA was remade as a community-based, community-driven project with a new mission to reclaim and revitalize the neighborhood through positive change. In this iteration of itself, the organization added new youth and workforce development programs to its roster.
