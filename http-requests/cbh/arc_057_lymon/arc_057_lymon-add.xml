    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Folder 2 contains a narrative history of the Cadman Plaza excavation site, as well as brief biographical sketches of the other excavation participants, both handwritten by Mr. Lymon. Also included in this folder is a photocopy of a typewritten proposal for a more formal, professionally-led excavation of the Cadman Plaza site. This document is dated January 17, 1966 and was written by John S. Kopper, Curator of the Henry Whitefield State Museum in Guilford, CT. It is not known if this project was ever undertaken.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Folder 3 consists of 46 black-and-white photographs taken by Mr. Lymon during the excavation. The photographs depict the dig site itself, as well as some of the structures uncovered during its course. All of the images have notes on the verso that explain briefly what is depicted in each. Individuals assumed to be members of the excavation team are depicted in some of the images, though they are not identified by name in the verso notes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Little is known about Terry Lymon, the donor and creator of the materials that comprise this collection. Mr. Lymon was a resident of Brooklyn during the 1960s, and he claimed to have been a Native American from New Jersey whose Native American name was Kalitarawana. He was a self-taught amateur archaeologist who supported his hobby by working odd jobs. In the summer of 1965, Mr. Lymon and several assistants undertook an archaeological excavation of the parcel of land bounded by Fulton, Middagh, and Henry Streets, which had recently been razed for the construction of Cadman Plaza. In the course of their excavation, the team uncovered several cisterns and dry wells, as well as many artifacts, including bottles, ceramics, and a pair of men's pants dating from the 19th century. Mr. Lymon, along with two of the excavation team members, Martin Schneider and Dwight Demeritt Jr., presented their findings at a lecture hosted by the Long Island Historical Society on September 20, 1965.</field>
