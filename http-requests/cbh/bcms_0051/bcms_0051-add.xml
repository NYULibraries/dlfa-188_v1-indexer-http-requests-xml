    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of items received and collected by Henry Stillwell Clapp while serving in World War I, the bulk of which was originally kept by Clapp in a canvas letter folder probably purchased at a military goods store. The letter folder is included in the collection with items most likely present at the time of purchase, including a pocket bible, address book, pay record book and English and French Conversation Book. Additional military documents include a claim of exemption and transfer request.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> This collection also includes correspondence sent and received during Clapp's deployment in France, the majority of which are between Clapp and his mother, Isabelle Clapp. They discuss gossip from home, updates on family members and news of the German surrender. Clapp also collected clippings from various newspapers concerning the war effort, including several copies of the "Walks and Talks" column written by Julius Chambers and published in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. He also collected various bits of poetry and famous quotations.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> While on deployment Clapp enrolled in journalism class by mail at the London Correspondence College. Items from the class include a lecture, request for payment and general correspondence. Coursework includes notes on Hamlet, a book report, and an essay on artistic vision and responsibility.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Henry Stillwell Clapp (1893-1980) was a salesman living in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. He enlisted in the United States Military on June 19, 1917. Upon enlisting, Clapp immediately requested a transfer to more active duty and was assigned to the 27th Division, also known as O'Ryan's Roughnecks, 102nd Military Police. Clapp was deployed to France where he fought in Ypres-Lys and the Somme Offensive.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> A short article describing his experience with the 102nd Military Police ran in the November 22, 1918 issue of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Shortly after, he enrolled in a journalism class at the London Correspondence College. It's unclear if he pursued journalism after returning to civilian life.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> After the War, Clapp returned to Brooklyn where he married Ida May Todd and had two children. The couple filed for divorce on November 9, 1933 in Reno, Nevada. Clapp died in Pennsylvania in 1980.</field>
