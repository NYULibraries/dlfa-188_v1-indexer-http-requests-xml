    <field name="bioghist_teim">Based on department heads lists, the Market Research was a department within advertising promotion  and circulation from 1949 to 1953. In 1954, these two separate departments were consolidated into one Market Research department but this department disappears from the department heads lists in 1964. Since much of the work done by Market Research overlapped with the work done in the Circulation department, it is believed that Circulation absorbed Market Research. Market Research and Circulation also tended to work conjointly on research projects.</field>
