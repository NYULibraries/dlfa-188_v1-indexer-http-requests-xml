    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Topp's Wings "Friend or Foe" military aircraft trading cards were issued in 1952 and sold in 1- or 5-cent packs of chewing gum. This was the company's first non-sports themed series of trading cards. A complete set consists of 200 numbered cards. (The present collection lacks 11 cards. See the inventory of this finding aid for details.) The front of each card displays a color image of a plane or other aircraft based on photographs supplied by the New York Herald Tribune. The planes and helicopters were in use during World War II and into the Korean War era by the armed forces of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey, with the majority belonging to the United States. The back of each card carries statistics on the aircraft depicted on the front, such as its wing spread, length, ceiling, maximum speed, weight, number of crew, and number of engines. Also appearing on the back of each card is the silhouette of a different aircraft, displayed below the phrase "Name This Plane" and above the question "Friend or Foe?" The quiz answers are revealed on a different card, the number of which follows the question.</field>
