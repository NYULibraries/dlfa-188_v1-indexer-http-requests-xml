    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes fragmentary records from the financial firm George P. Butler &amp; Brother. The firm existed from 1898 to 1911; the records date primarily from the later years of the firm, that is 1906-1911, though there are gaps even within that range. Nonetheless, the firm's clients, trading activity, and transactions as market intermediaries are well-represented in the records. These records include incoming and outgoing correspondence, perhaps especially for 1909, but touching at least in part on all years from 1906-11. In addition to transaction executions, some letters include investment advice and outlook for particular securities, many of which are railroad companies. The container list identifies the more frequent correspondents. Accounting records in the collection include copies of client statements, transaction blotters, ledgers, journals, and cancelled checks/vouchers. Many of these records document the receipt of dividends and interest from railroads and other companies, and the distribution of those payments to the firm's clients.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">George Prentiss Butler was born February 13, 1863, in New York City, the son of Mary Marshall Butler and William Allen Butler. He graduated from Princeton University in 1884 and married Ellen Mudge of Yonkers in 1886, where they continued to reside.  In 1898, Butler and his brother Arthur W. Butler formed a brokerage firm in New York, George P. Butler &amp; Brother, dealing in bonds and stocks. Both brothers were members of the New York Stock Exchange and the firm was said to be associated with Gould family interests. The firm was located at 35 Wall Street.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">George died suddenly in London at age 48 on April 7, 1911. His obituary in the New York Times states that he had traveled to Europe for health reasons. Records in the collection indicate that the firm was already undergoing liquidation by March 1911, before George's death. Arthur completed the firm's liquidation in July 1911. After the firm's dissolution, Arthur joined E. Hicks Herrick and Henry S. Kip to form the new partnership of Butler, Herrick and Kip.</field>
