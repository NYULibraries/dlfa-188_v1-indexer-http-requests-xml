    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes correspondence between the George P. Butler &amp; Brother firm and its clients and client representatives, such as banks, attorneys, and other investment firms. Most of the letters are outgoing from the firm, either in the form of carbon copies or in sheets in three copybooks. Nonetheless, foldered correspondence also holds many incoming letters and telegrams.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Incoming correspondence generally includes client inquiries or transaction orders. Outgoing correspondence often includes order confirmations and transmittals of payments of interest, dividends and other proceeds, and of stock and bond certificates. Although most of the correspondence is transactional, a number of letters convey information about securities available, and advice about whether or not to acquire particular securities. Bonds and stocks issued by railroads appear to comprise most of the securities referenced in the letters (including, among others, the Manhattan Railway Company), but utility companies also appear.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the foldered incoming and outgoing letters are from 1909, with a very few ranging back to 1908 or forward to early 1910. The three copybooks range from mid-1906 to early 1911, but have large gaps in coverage. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The copybooks have indexes of correspondents at the front of the volumes. These, and the correspondence generally, were skimmed by the archivist to identify any especially prominent correspondents, such as a Rockefeller or a J.P. Morgan, but none appeared. The more frequent individual correspondents, some of which are women handling financial matters, are noted in the container list.</field>
