    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I: Caroline H. Butler Laing</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. Correspondence, 1823-1892 (bulk 1869-1871). Approximately 100 items (Box 1, folders 1-4).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Letters packed with details of her day to day life, from Northampton, Mass., to Brooklyn, N.Y., to Europe and back. The vast majority are letters sent by her. The early ones are mostly to her first husband; the later ones are mostly to her daughter Mary Hunt Butler Reeves, with several to her daughter Harriet in Rome. They are observant of much detail of surroundings and events.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. Diaries, 1836-1837, 1869-1871 (bulk 1869-1871), 13 v.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The earliest diary is from her voyage to and from China with her first husband. The 1869-1871 diaries consist of 12 v., beginning in the days before her departure for Europe (1 v.), continuing through her time in Rome (10 v.), and ending with a diary of her travels in Europe before returning to the United States. In this last diary she also lists "Expenses from Rome." In each Rome diary, Mrs. Laing has listed the "Contents" in the back. These are generally lists of sites described, rather than of all topics covered. There are occasional pasted-in illustrations and dried plant inserts.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3. Butler Family Genealogies, undated., 1 v.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"Genealogy of Thomas Butler and of his descendants from the year 1739" and "Genealogy of Richard Butler and of his descendants from the year 1631." The former is an extensive genealogy of her paternal family, extending down to her own grandchildren. The latter, describing her husband's paternal family, stops after one generation, but an inserted letter provides further information.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4. Receipts [Recipes], undated., 1 v.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A collection of about 100 recipes from family and friends in Mrs. Laing's handwriting and then in the handwriting of her daughter Mary.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">5. Writings, c. 1850, 2 v. and 1 folder (folder is in Box 2, folder 5).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Late drafts or fair copies of several of Mrs. Laing's works of fiction for children. One of the volumes appears to have been used previously by Edward Butler in 1848 for mercantile business records.</field>
