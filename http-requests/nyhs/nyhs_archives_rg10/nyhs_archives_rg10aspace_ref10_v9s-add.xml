    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Transaction Records series includes those documents recording various activities of the Publication Fund, especially the issuance of Fund certificates, the payment of dividends in the years prior to the start of publishing, the delivery of publications, and some nineteenth century expenditures. The bulk of the series includes several volumes, including the two original share certificate books in which stubs remain for the issued shares with the name of the investor and later transfer information, as well as unused blank certificates. One of these certificate books dates from the Fund's beginning in 1858; the other dates from 1908 and includes certificates bearing the new reference to DePeyster in its title. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other volumes include subscriber names and addresses, publications delivered to them, dividends due and paid, and exchanges of publications with other institutions. In addition to the registers, records about the changes in share ownership over time are found in card files and various informal lists, especially one from 1944 that seemed to result from a significant effort to reconcile and update the shareholder records. The series includes some documents dating from the founding of the Fund, including the report of the committee that recommended the creation of the Fund, the 1858 and 1865 offering circulars, a subscription book, and other early material. Transcriptions from the 1920s of relevant nineteenth century minutes and reports are in the series. Financial records date from the nineteenth century and include bank books, cancelled checks, dividend payment records, bills, and notes on investment income. </field>
