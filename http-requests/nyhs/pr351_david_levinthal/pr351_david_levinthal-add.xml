    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes 45 color Polaroids taken by photographer David Levinthal of his toy constructions. The collection includes images from four of Levinthal's series: "Baseball" (23 photographs), "Hockey" (11 photographs), "Coney Island" (6 photographs), and "Wild West" (5 photographs). All photographs are original prints, signed and dated by Levinthal. All are 20" x 24" images, on larger sheets. Except for the Wild West series, the images are noted as "AP" (artist's print) or the number of the limited edition. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">All of the photographs are untitled, but subjects are identifiable in many. In the Baseball series, many of the figures are in the uniform of the New York Yankees, though the Brooklyn Dodgers and other teams appear, as do umpires (one in argument with a manager) and a batboy. The Hockey series includes some of the great players, including Wayne Gretzky, Martin Brodeur, and Jaromir Jagr and Mark Messier in New York Rangers garb. The Coney Island series depicts a carousel, Space Ride, roller coaster, and bumper cars. The Wild West includes both placid scenes of frontiersmen in town and of Indians at their teepees and violent scenes of a hanging and a fight to what appears to be imminent death for a native American.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">David Levinthal was born in 1949 in San Francisco, later residing in New York City. He earned his BA in Studio Art from Stanford University and his MFA from Yale. His work is found in the collections of several prominent institutions including, in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His work has been published and been the subject of many exhibitions, including a 1997 retrospective at New York's International Center of Photography. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Levinthal's photographs are of toy-like constructions or scenarios of his own creation, of figures, objects, and landscapes. The constructions, and the associated photographs, relate together in various themes or series, such as "Baseball" or "Coney Island," two of the four series represented in New-York Historical's collection.</field>
