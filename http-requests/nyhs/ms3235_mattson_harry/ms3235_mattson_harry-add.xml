    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of 116 letters written between August 1917 and February 1919 by soldier Harry R. Mattson (1894–1956) to his parents at home in Brooklyn. Many letters were mailed from Camp Wadsworth, the United States Army training facility at Spartanburg, South Carolina, while the rest were sent from "somewhere in France" and "somewhere in Belgium." As a corporal in Company G, 106th Regiment, United States Army, 27th Division, Mattson served in Europe from May 10, 1918 to March 6, 1919, and would have participated in the Ypres-Lys Offensive and the Somme Offensive. He was honorably discharged on April 2, 1919, and received the Silver Star Medal for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States.</field>
