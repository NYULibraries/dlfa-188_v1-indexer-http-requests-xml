    <field name="bioghist_teim">"This is the Army" was a World War II-era American musical (book by James McColl, music and lyrics by Irving Berlin) that was produced by the U.S. Army on Broadway over twelve weeks in the summer of 1942. During its run at the Broadway Theatre, the show—starring soldiers alongside professional performers and featuring such memorable tunes as "Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning"—raised $40,000 per week for the benefit of the Army Emergency Relief Fund. It next toured nationally and internationally, and in 1943 became a musical comedy film by the same title. In 1944–1945, under the auspices of the Special Services branch of the American military, the production traveled to Allied bases in Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific, bringing along much of the same cast to entertain troops stationed there. The final performance of "This is the Army" took place on Maui, Hawaii, on October 22, 1945.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Two men associated with the show—and long associated with each other—were Justus "Jus" Addiss (1917–1979) and Hayden Rorke (1910–1987). Addiss served as stage manager for the touring productions of "This is the Army." He went on to a career directing television programs such as "The Twilight Zone" and "Mr. Ed." Hayden Rorke (born William Henry Rorke) was a prolific actor who appeared in the Broadway run of "This is the Army," and made his screen debut (uncredited) in the film version. He is best remembered for playing Colonel Alfred Bellows in the 1960s sitcom "I Dream of Jeannie." Rorke and Addiss were romantic partners who lived together until the latter's death in 1979.</field>
