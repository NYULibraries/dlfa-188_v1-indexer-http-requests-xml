    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II is composed mainly of views of residential houses, including some of Brooklyn row houses. Most of these photographs appear to be on Long Island; many shots show wooden, farm-like houses. The same scene is often shown in several negatives. A churchyard in East Hampton is pictured with an elaborate sepulchre. Windmills are shown for many of the Long Island towns. Several of the negative boxes had Armbruster's notation on the geographical location of negative subjects. The negatives in the boxes which lacked any notation have been arranged by general subject category.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Nitrate negatives were interleaved with acid free paper and stored five to a negative sleeve. Several of the negative boxes had Armbruster's notation on geographical place of negatives. These negatives are grouped by geography after Armbruster's titles (which appear in quotation marks) and then further divided by subject. Many other boxes had no notation. These negatives were arranged by general subject category. Nitrate negatives were assigned box numbers in coordination with other nitrate negatives held by the New-York Historical Society. These negatives are located on Floor 14 in the N-YHS Library Stacks. (See also, Separated Material)</field>
