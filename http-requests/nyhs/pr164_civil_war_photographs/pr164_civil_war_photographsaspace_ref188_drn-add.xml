    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VI holds random plates from that two-volume, 100-image album of views published after the war by Philp &amp; Solomons (Washington: 1866). The publication consisted of albumen prints taken by Alexander Gardner during the war, which were mounted within a lithographed border on sheets with letterpress captions. The plates found here came from a variety of sources, and many have been cropped to various dimensions, possibly having to do with their exhibition history. The Society does hold a complete copy of the Sketch Book, located in the library collections, but does not have a complete set of loose plates. There are duplicates of many of the plates, and many of the images appear in Series I and III.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Images are filed by plate number taken from the published volumes. This plate set is not complete.</field>
