    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes the records related to the 1990s traveling exhibition John James Audubon: The Watercolors for The Birds of America. The exhibition included about 100 of N-YHS's Audubon works and was the first time N-YHS had ever allowed the watercolors to travel. The exhibition venues were the National Gallery of Art, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Detroit Institute of Arts, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Fine Arts Houston, Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Seattle Art Museum, and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes the early planning documents for the exhibition and the files related to specific venues, including contractual agreements, object lists, designs, labels, shipping, publicity, insurance, funding, and other matters. Correspondence with venues that did not show the exhibition are included. Although planning for the exhibition began about 1990, the subseries also includes inquiries and other Audubon-related matter back to 1984 that was filed with the exhibition records. The subseries also includes photocopies of correspondence with American Heritage dating back to the 1960s, but this appears to be redundant of the originals in Series I. Select Collections Correspondence.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A companion volume was also produced: John James Audubon: The Watercolors for The Birds of America, edited by Annette Blaugrund and Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr. and published by Villard Books in 1993. The subseries includes various files concerning the arrangements for the publication of this catalogue.</field>
