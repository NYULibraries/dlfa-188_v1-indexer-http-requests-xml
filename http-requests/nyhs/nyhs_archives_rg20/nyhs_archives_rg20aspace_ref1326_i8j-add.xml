    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes files maintained by and for Mary Childs Black (referred to as "MCB" in many of the documents), who was Curator of Painting, Sculpture and the Decorative Arts at N-YHS from 1970 through 1982. Black was an authority on American folk art. Prior to joining N-YHS, she had been the Director of the Museum of American Folk Art in New York (1964-1970) and Director of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Collection at Williamsburg (late 1950s-1964). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Black's records primarily include two overlapping sets of files, one ordered by subject and the other ordered chronologically. The chronological files generally hold only correspondence and the topics include proposed and executed exhibitions, publication and other projects, research inquiries, professional exchanges, offers of objects for accession, and other museum professional matters. The subject files also hold correspondence concerning the same general and even particular matters, but also hold a broader range of documentation, such as photographs, research notes on artists and other topics, drafts of articles and other writings, etc. The container list includes a complete list of the subject files, using the original label headings. These first two sets were processed and described in 2016; in 2021, additional materials from Black's files were transferred to the archves and these were described broadlt at the box level and are found at the end of the container list.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">It appears that many files related to specific exhibitions might have been removed from these records and boxed separately. For files of exhibitions during Black's tenure, at least many of which were surely from Black's office, see Series II. Exhibitions, Subseries A. General Files. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although the bulk of the material dates from the years of Black's tenure at N-YHS, there is a set of 1940s correspondence between the United States Trust Company of New York and the Museum of the City of New York concerning the bequest of a Trumbull portrait to MCNY, subsequently renounced in favor of N-YHS (see the Trumbull subject file).</field>
