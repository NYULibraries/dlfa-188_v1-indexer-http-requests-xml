    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries includes files from the Museum Department that have a mix of subject matter and that seem to have been created over time by various staff members, or perhaps by a single but no longer identifiable staff member (i.e., of mixed or uncertain provenance). Additional materials will likely accrue to the subseries over time. As of 2016, there are two "sets" of records in the subseries, designated in the container list simply as "Set A" and "Set B."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Set A includes files that combine both registrar and curatorial matters. The bulk of these files span 1939-1949, dating from the earliest days when N-YHS expanded its museum professional staff. The principal contributors to these files appear to be Carolyn Scoon (Registrar and later Assistant Curator, ranging from the 1940s to about 1966) and H. Maxson Holloway (Curator during part of the 1940s). The date range of the files extends to the 1960s so correspondence to Director R.W.G. Vail and others do appear, in addition to Scoon. The correspondence primarily concerns offers of objects accepted and declined, inquiries regarding objects, loans to and from N-YHS for exhibitions, photograph permissions, and other object-related matters. The subseries includes extensive information about accessions in the form of correspondence, accession receipts, lists, appraisals, and acknowledgements. Library accessions are reflected in these records to a significant degree as well as those of the museum. Donors/correspondents are noted in the container list below when they are represented in a file by substantive documentation or lengthy object lists.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Set B includes more recent (1993-2002) files of inquiries and declined accession offers.</field>
