    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Includes working files, likely those principally of curator Annette Blaugrund, for a proposed exhibition that was initially targeted for 1993 or 1994, but was postponed to 1996 or 1997. It appears to have never been installed at N-YHS, though N-YHS loaned objects to an exhibition of this title curated by Blaugrund in 1997 at the Parrish Museum of Art and the National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts. An alternative working title was Show and Sell: The Marketing of Art in the Tenth Street Studio Building. The principal working title of Painting and Patronage for exhibition was similar enough to the working title of N-YHS's planned reinstallation of the permanent collection that the files for each seem to have been confused with documents for both matters in one or the other's files. During processing in 2016, the archivist attempted to sort these out, but some mixture likely remains. Accordingly, researchers interested in the Tenth Street files (Painting and Patronage) should also refer to the permanent installation files (Patronage and Collecting), and vice versa.</field>
