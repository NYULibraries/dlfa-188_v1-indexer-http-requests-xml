    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Exhibitions series includes files related to the planning and presentation of exhibitions at N-YHS, especially for the 1980s and later, though there are a few files for the 1970s and earlier. The bulk of the files include documentation compiled from various sources within the Museum Department of specific exhibitions. Although the specific content varies widely by exhibition, documents can include checklists, images, loan documentation, publicity material, research files, comment books, wall texts and labels, design elements, budgets and funding requests, and other like matter. Not all exhibitions are represented in the series and some are very lightly documented. On the other hand, several are more extensively documented, such as the traveling exhibition of the Audubon watercolors in the 1990s. The bulk of the files relate to installed exhibitions, but some proposed exhibitions are also included, perhaps most notably the files for the planning of a 1990s exhibition concerning the Tenth Street Studio Building.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Files related to exhibitions were transferred to the archives over time by various members of the museum staff. Consequently, important exhibition files can be found in other Museum series, especially the Curatorial and the Collections Management series.</field>
