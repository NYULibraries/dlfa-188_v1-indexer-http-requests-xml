    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes, at least primarily, the files of Holly Hotchner. (Some files of other museum personnel, including former curator Ella Foshay (1984-1989), were likely mixed in with these when stored.) These represent the range of Hotchner's activities from her early years in conservation to her later years as Museum Director. The files range from general conservation matters, storage and warehousing, object surveys and inventories, some exhibition and special event planning, and professional activities. Particular initiatives that are well-represented in the subseries include the licensing arrangements with Birchrun Mint to reproduce one of the Rogers groups, "Weighing the Baby", conservation of the Louis XVI chair, planning for new storage at Crozier Warehouse in 1990, and arrangements for the Thomas Cole: Landscape into History and Equitable Gallery exhibitions. There are many files related to outgoing loans, though these may simply be additional files that were inadvertently separated from the bulk of loan files found in Series IV. Collection Management Files. Fuller summaries of the content are provided in the container list below. Certain files related to Hotchner's activities as Museum Director during the 1990s are currently restricted. See the Access Restrictions note.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Holly Hotchner joined N-YHS in 1984 to play a leadership role in the conservation initiatives of the Museum Department. The mid-1980s to early 1990s were a turbulent time in N-YHS's history and Hotchner's scope of responsibility gradually expanded, formally and informally, over this period. By 1989, with the departure of museum curator Ella Foshay (1984-1989), Hotchner was promoted from Chief Conservator to Museum Director. At the same time, the Department of Prints, Photographs, and Architecture (the Print Room) was transferred from the Library to the Museum, where it would remain organizationally until 1998. The Security Department was also  transferred to Hotchner's leadership at this time. As Museum Director and a member of the senior management team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hotchner was closely involved with N-YHS's facilities and fiscal planning, the effort to broaden the museum's professional staff, and the initiative to refine the institution's collections policy and the associated deaccessioning process. By mid-1993, at the height of N-YHS's fiscal crisis and as a result of large numbers of staff lay-offs, resignations, and other departures, only Hotchner remained as the senior level executive at N-YHS. Her role narrowed in early 1994 as N-YHS Co-Chair "Pug" Winokur took over responsibility for the Museum while Hotchner focused on the deaccessioning initiative of the time and the planning of certain major exhibitions. Later In 1994 Hotchner also left N-YHS.</field>
