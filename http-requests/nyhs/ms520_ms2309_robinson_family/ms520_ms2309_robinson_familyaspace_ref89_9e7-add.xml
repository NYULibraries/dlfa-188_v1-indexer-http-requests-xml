    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence in this series includes letters specifically addressed to Dr. Beverley Robinson and letters addressed by the Robinson children to both him and Anna, (often Mamma and Pappa). The letters are mainly personal, from friends and family describing everyday events or travel. There is little correspondence regarding professional matters and some of the correspondence is in French. Almost all of the letters from 1903 express support for his son Beverley R. Robinson's candidacy for Alderman. The correspondence also includes letters from Beverley Robinson to family members while he was studying medicine in Paris during the American Civil War. Although Beverley mentions the cholera epidemic in Paris during that time, his letters mostly detail his homesickness and his studies.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also contains writings and memorabilia for Beverley Robinson. It includes some of his published medical writings as well as certificate from Pennsylvania Adjutant General's Office stating he served for 90 days in the State Militia. Other than this certificate, there is no information on Beverley Robinson's efforts in the Gettysburg campaign in the American Civil War. </field>
