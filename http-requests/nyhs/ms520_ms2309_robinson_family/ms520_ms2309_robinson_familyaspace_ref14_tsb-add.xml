    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I: Pauline Lentilhon Robinson (1885-1959)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes the letters, scrapbooks, and memorabilia of Pauline Robinson, the unmarried middle daughter of Dr. Beverley Robinson and Anna Foster Robinson. The bulk of the series consists of Pauline Robinson's numerous scrapbooks which include clippings, letters and memorabilia regarding social events and charity work. The scrapbooks are in chronological order and two of them have been disbound and foldered for conservation purposes. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The scrapbooks entitled "Year Books" specifically detail New York City social events. They consist of invitations and programs from dinners, concerts, plays, parties, dances, and weddings, and include newspaper clippings of the events and lists of those who attended. Pauline Robinson's volume "House Party Book," includes the photographs and names of companions who accompanied her on many East Coast trips. Although Pauline Robinson's own debut party is not covered in the scrapbooks, other social affairs such as Alice Roosevelt's debutante party and the Astors' Ball are documented. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also of interest in this series is a volume entitled a "Chap Record" in which Pauline has listed many of the numerous "chaps" who she is acquainted with, and has rated them according to various categories.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Much of Pauline Robinson's correspondence is from family members describing recent trips or from others recognizing her for her charity work. Of particular interest is a 1915 letter from a Mildred Wallace describing her reaction to the sinking of the Lusitania and her personal reaction to seeing Jane Addams at a lecture on the "Woman Question." The writings in this series are mainly short essays or articles which Pauline Robinson attempted to have published. Other specific information on the charity work of Pauline Robinson can be found in Series 14: Charities. </field>
