    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Mathew B. Brady Studio Portrait Photograph Collection contains approximately 6,000 proof portraits of men, women, and children who were photographed in Brady's New York studios between the mid-1850s and the late 1860s. The portraits in this collection were those kept by the studio as a visual patron record, and are nearly all labeled with the last name of the sitter or sitters. The prints are unmounted and were formerly housed in albums. </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mathew B. Brady, the best-known American photographer of his generation, operated portrait studios in New York from 1844 to 1875. Brady began his career as a daguerreotypist. He was located at 205-207 Broadway (at Fulton Street) from 1844 until 1858, ran a second New York studio at 359 Broadway (between White and Franklin Streets) from 1853 through 1860, and a third studio at 643 Broadway (at Bleecker Street) from 1859 to 1860. All New York operations were consolidated in the fall of 1860 in Brady's fourth and final studio, named the "National Portrait Gallery," located at 785 Broadway (at Tenth Street). Brady generally did not take the photographs himself, but employed teams of uncredited camera operators, processors, and colorists in each of his studios who produced the actual images for which he is famous. Brady also operated portrait studios in Washington, D.C., and is known for the hundreds of photographs taken during the American Civil War by other photographers that were issued by the Brady Studio.</field>
