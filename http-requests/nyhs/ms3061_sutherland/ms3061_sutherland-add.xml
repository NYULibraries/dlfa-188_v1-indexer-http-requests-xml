In addition to his studies at Litchfield (Connecticut) Law School in 1825, Sutherland read law at the office of Samuel G. Huntington of Waterford, New York, and then at the office of Bushnell &amp; Stebbins of Hudson, New York. He was admitted to the bar in 1828 or 1829 (sources vary) and began practice in Livingston, New York, in partnership with Robert H.
