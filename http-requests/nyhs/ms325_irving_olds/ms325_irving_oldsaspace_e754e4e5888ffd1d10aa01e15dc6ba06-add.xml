    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series contains mostly pleasantries between Olds and his colleagues, friends, and the public.  Letters are approximately split evenly between carbon copies of letters written by Olds, and original letters received by Olds.  Although there are occasional references to U.S. Steel and White &amp; Case, the correspondence is mostly personal in nature.  There are a few letters to and from notable figures, such as former President Herbert Hoover.  The bulk of the correspondence dates from the 1940s to his death in 1963, although there are letters of his that date back to approximately 1910.  Most correspondents are not well-known, although any of note (either due to their historical prominence or substantial appearance within the collection) will be specified within the scope notes of each folder.  At the end of the series, there are subject files which contain mostly correspondence with universities at which he was speaker or from whom he was receiving an honorary degree, and with museums regarding exhibitions he organized.</field>
