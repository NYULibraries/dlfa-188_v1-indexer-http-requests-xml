    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This small collection documents the 1996 lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco against the Seventh Regiment Fund and other involved parties, disputing ownership of the artifacts, artwork, memorabilia, etc., housed in the Seventh Regiment Armory (643 Park Avenue) and charged to have been lost or illegally disposed of by the Seventh Regiment Fund. It includes object lists, pleading files and other court papers, printed by-laws of the Seventh Regiment Fund, newspaper clippings, and copies of legal research and supporting material.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Seventh Regiment, known as the "silk stocking regiment" for its well-heeled members, descends from four volunteer militia companies organized in 1806 to protect New York from attack by the British. The Seventh Regiment, along with other military and social organizations, has been housed since 1880 in the massive armory at 643 Park Avenue, which incorporates rooms for company offices, a library, galleries, and a block-long drill hall. The Armory's interiors were designed by such Gilded Age giants as Louis Comfort Tiffany and Stanford White.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Seventh Regiment Fund was incorporated in 1909 "to promote and conserve the interests and welfare of the Seventh Regiment, National Guard, New York, and its successors, and to that end and for those purposes to take and hold by gift, bequest, purchase or lease, either absolutely or in trust, real or personal property, to apply the same and the income, rents, issues and profits, derived from the investment thereof, for the purposes aforesaid, in such manner and at such times as the Board of Directors may from time to time direct." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By their interpretation, the Seventh Regiment Fund controlled the contents of the armory, and could dispose of them with impunity. But in 1996, New York Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco filed suit against the Seventh Regiment Fund, charging that its directors had illegally assumed title to the artifacts in their care, and had possibly lost or sold many of them without turning over proceeds to the state. In 2006 a judge ruled in favor of New York State's ownership of the disputed memorabilia.</field>
