    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection holds 29 scrapbooks compiled by New Yorker Adele Buchalter (1899-1991). Comprised primarily of photographs, the albums trace Buchalter's life from infancy through her move at age 80 to a retirement community. Subjects include, among others, Buchalter's school years at Horace Mann School for Girls and Vassar College, volunteer service at the start of World War I, her career in retail mostly as a buyer/purchasing agent, her family history (which includes 19th century Jewish immigrants from Germany), and extensive travels in the 1970s.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes 29 scrapbooks compiled by Adele Buchalter documenting the arc of her life from infancy in 1899 to her life in a retirement community in 1981, with particular emphasis on her connections with family and friends, aspects of her career, and extensive travel later in life. The first album centers on Buchalter's family history, including ancestors and descendants from her extended family.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The albums principally hold photographs, which are typically captioned, at least collectively and sufficiently to provide context and identification of individuals and places. There are also a variety of other document types; depending on the subject matter these include event programs, certificates, dance cards, invitations, letters, newspaper clippings, postcards, artwork (from children and adults), travel itineraries and brochures, and more. Glimpses of Buchalter's career in retail and as a purchasing agent, and later as an instructor of economics, are found in some of the scrapbooks in the form of business correspondence, compensation slips, acknowledgements of her work, articles she wrote, and other material. Some of the later volumes, which emphasize travel, include Buchalter's circular letters to her friends and family summarizing her travels or other activities for a given year.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list below provides a sense of the subject content of each volume as perceived by the processing archivist from a skim of each. The title used for the album is that found on the album's label, presumably given by Buchalter. Post-it notes and other notations found throughout the volumes were likely made by family members and are suggestive that some portions were scanned before donation to N-YHS.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Adele Buchalter (nee Lowinson) was born in New York City in 1899 to Frieda and Louis Lowinson. This collection provides some of her family ancestry, going back to her great-grandfather, Leon Sternberger, who was born in Bavaria in 1819. Sternberger, a Jewish cantor, immigrated to the United States in 1849 and later became cantor at Temple Beth El in Manhattan. Other members of Buchalter's extended family were also Jewish immigrants from Germany in the 19th century.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Adele Lowinson attended Horace Mann School for Girls, graduating in 1916. She then attended Vassar College, where she met Lieutenant Benjamin Buchalter of the U.S. Navy in 1917 as he passed through New York City during his military service in World War I. Adele married Buchalter in 1918.  She continued her education at Vassar for a time, but apparently did not graduate, though she identified with her Class of 1920 through her life. She would eventually finish her studies, earning a B.A. in 1952 from the University of California at Berkeley. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Adele and Benjamin had two sons, Benjamin Jr. (born 1921) and Lloyd Arthur (born 1923). Tragically, Adele's husband died of tuberculosis in 1925 and Adele raised her sons as a single mother, likely with the help of her parents. To support the family, Adele entered the workforce about 1926, working as a salesperson and eventually as a buyer, or purchasing agent, in the retail field, specifically in the area of infant and children's wear. Along the way, she also seems to have been involved with design work of marketing materials and of children's games. She also was active in the buyers' trade association.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By 1970, Buchalter was working for the New York State Department of Labor as an Employment Counselor when, at age 70, she was required by law to retire from state employment. At that time she became an instructor of economics for the Henry George School of Social Science in New York. In that capacity she traveled to Calgary in Alberta, Canada, for a conference. She was so entranced with Calgary that, shortly after in 1972, she bought a house there and left New York. Through the 1970s, she joined tour groups to travel extensively in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. In 1979, she sold her home in Calgary and moved to Washington Square, a retirement community in Hinsdale, Illinois. Adele Buchalter died in 1991.</field>
