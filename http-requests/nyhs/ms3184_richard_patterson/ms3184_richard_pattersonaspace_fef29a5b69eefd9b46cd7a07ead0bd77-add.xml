    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This volume is unique in the collection in that it holds many document types in addition to clippings, such as photographs, certificates, and ephemera (programs, business/calling cards, membership cards), and, although it tends to emphasize subject matter from Patterson's early life and career, it touches on various aspects of his career into the 1960s.
