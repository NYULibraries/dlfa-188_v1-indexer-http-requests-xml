    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes the records of the New York Produce Exchange and the related New York Commercial Association, spanning the years 1860-1955, which includes all but the last couple of decades of the organization's history. The collection consists almost entirely of 330 volumes of records: minutes of meetings of the Board of Managers, members, and committees; records of complaints, arbitration proceedings, and dispute resolution agreements; membership registers and dues payment records; data on daily trades, calls, and quotations for a wide range of commodities including cotton seed oil (CSO), wheat and other grains, black pepper, and many more; accounting ledgers and journals for the Exchange's General Fund and special funds, such as the Chemists Fund; and some employee payroll records. Committee records include those of the Buildings Committee responsible for oversight of construction of the building that opened in 1884 on Broadway at Bowling Green. A set of boxed unbound papers document the Exchange's negotiations with the federal government's Arbitration Committee in 1928-1929 concerning delivery contracts for cotton seed oil.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Produce Exchange, which dissolved in 1973, traced its origin to the 1840s-1850s and the informal association of merchants that engaged in the trade or exchange of various commodities in New York City. In the late 1850s, in response to the merchants' desire to acquire a building for a suitable place to conduct trade, subscriptions were raised and a building constructed and opened for business in 1861. That same year a company—the New York Produce Exchange Company—was incorporated, apparently with responsibility for the physical plant and overall administration of Exchange operations, but not for regulation of the commodities markets and the tenants, who were the merchants themselves. The merchants retained that self-regulatory responsibility and, on April 19, 1862, they incorporated as the New-York Commercial Association. The two organizations continued to operate in parallel until perhaps 1872. In 1868 the Association had its charter amended and changed its name to New York Produce Exchange and in 1872 the corporation took ownership of the building, completing the unification of the business and building forms of the Exchange. (It is not clear whether the two corporations actually merged at some point or whether the original Company of 1861 eventually dissolved after the sale of the building.)</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Through the 1870s, space for the growing activities of the Exchange was a pressing problem; this was resolved with the construction of a large building, designed by George Post, at Bowling Green in 1884. The Exchange remained there until 1957 when it moved to new quarters and the 1884 building was demolished.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over the course of a century, the specific commodities that the Produce Exchange engaged in varied. Grains (e.g. wheat) and cotton seed oil (commonly abbreviated in the records as "CSO") were major products for much or all of its history, but other commodities were also traded, including tallow, pork, petroleum, lard, and others. Initially a cash or spot market only (i.e., for immediate delivery of goods), the Exchange also participated in the futures market (i.e., contracts for future delivery of commodities on agreed terms). </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Well beyond simply providing a setting for the trading of goods, the Produce Exchange, as with exchanges generally, was a fundamental element of free market capitalism and the effort to keep economic power, by shaping the market, within the hands of the merchants. Accordingly, the Produce Exchange maintained various committees for admitting members, arbitrating disputes, inspecting the quality of goods, setting rules for deliveries of commodities, and other self-regulating and self-disciplining devices that would serve the interests of the merchants as a class, while also serving as justifications for minimal or no interventions by the legislature or courts, and for the homogenization of products by farmers and other producers.</field>
