    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection primarily holds copies of Clarence Bowen's outgoing letters in connection with his position as Secretary in 1889 of New York's Committee on the Centennial Celebration of Washington's Inauguration and as editor of the related memorial volume published subsequently, in 1892. (There are very few incoming letters.) The collection also holds scrapbooks of newspaper clippings covering the 1889 celebration; working files and bound volumes with lists of attendees, etc. for the ball, banquet, and other specific events; invitations, funding legislation, and other original documentation and ephemera; and metallic printing plates for tickets, press passes, invitations, and other print matter for the celebration.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the mid-1880s, New-York Historical Society, the Sons of the Revolution, and the New York Chamber of Commerce each passed resolutions calling for the celebration in 1889 of the centennial anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington as the first president under the new Constitution of the United States. In November 1887, New York City Mayor Abram S. Hewitt presided over an organizing meeting that resulted in the formation of the Committee of Citizens, or more formally the Committee on the Centennial Celebration of Washington's Inauguration. Clarence Bowen, the compiler of the records in this collection and the donor of it to N-YHS, was Secretary of the Committee.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Celebration comprised several major events spanning April 29-May 1, 1889, (with some earlier events) that attracted the (bipartisan) attendance of then-U.S. President Benjamin Harrison and former Presidents Grover Cleveland and Rutherford B. Hayes. It included parades, banquets, a ball, an exhibition, a religious service, a re-enactment by President Harrison of Washington's arrival at the foot of Wall Street for the inauguration, and more. Funding was provided by the state, city and private sources. Subsequent to the Celebration, a Publication Committee remained to produce a memorial volume recounting the history of the Centennial's events. Clarence Bowen stayed on as editor of that volume and he wrote many of its chapters. </field>
