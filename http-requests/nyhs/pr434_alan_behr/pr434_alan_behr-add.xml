    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection holds 142 black and white photographs taken by Alan Behr. 80 of the photos are from Behr's series "Naked at the Ball," which are scenes from the party and benefit circuit on Manhattan's Upper East Side. 61 photos are from Behr's series "New York During the Covid-19 Lockdown," which captures New Yorkers going about their lives, masked or unmasked, during the coronavirus pandemic. One photo is of a group of women reacting to the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">All the photographs are signed by Alan Behr. Almost all are captioned by the photographer on the reverse, with title, location, and year. These captions were used in the finding aid's list of photographs. The photographer included an inventory of donated titles with his gift; in a few cases the inventory information differed from the caption. In those cases, the caption was used in the finding aid list, but the alternative information from the inventory was noted. In a few cases, the inventory provided somewhat more, but not factually different, information than the caption did; for those, the finding aid list drew on both sources.</field>
