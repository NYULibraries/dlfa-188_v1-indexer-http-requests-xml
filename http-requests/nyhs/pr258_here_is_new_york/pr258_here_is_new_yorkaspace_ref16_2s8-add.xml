    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> This series contains images of or related to 9/11 that were submitted to here is new york by amateur and professional photographers. Here is new york scanned each image (unless it was already in digital format), created corrected low (jpg) and high (tif) resolution digital versions, assigned image numbers, and (in most cases) returned the originals to the contributors. They then created prints, which were displayed in the Soho location (and later in exhibitions throughout the U.S., Europe, and Japan) and sold for charity. The digital images (low-res jpgs) were put on a website in December 2001. Here is new york published a book of selected images in September 2002. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the images are of New York City, especially of initial damage to the World Trade Center, the collapse of the towers, environmental damage and victims in lower Manhattan, Ground Zero, firefighters, police and rescue workers, missing persons fliers, memorials throughout the city, and the WTC before 9/11. There are also numerous images of the Pentagon and Washington, D.C. Also depicted are the Towers of Light in 2002, memorial services, the crash site of Flight 93 in Shanksville, PA, and reactions to 9/11 in various cities. In 2002, here is new york solicited images of the effects of 9/11 and related issues, including the war in Afghanistan, other sites of terrorism, and world events.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Professional photographers in this collection represent the New York Times, the Washington Post, the New Yorker, Associated Press, Reuters, Magnum, Getty, Corbis, and other photo agencies. There are also images taken by freelance professional photographers. Here is new york did not distinguish between professionals and amateurs when selecting and inputting photographs. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A number of photographers participated in here is new york's Voices of 9.11 oral history project--see Series II for their testimonies. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although this collection contains a number of well-known images of 9/11, it does not include some of the iconic photographs, such as three firefighters raising an American flag at Ground Zero or the image known as "the falling man." </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The sets of prints in this series were displayed at the original Prince Street location and the Corcoran Gallery exhibition. The Corcoran set was partially composed of images that had been displayed in the Chicago exhibition earlier in 2002.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The numbering system that here is new york used has a number of gaps where no image was assigned, especially a large one from 3556 to 4999. Therefore, although there are 6,254 digital images in the collection, image numbers go up to 8860. </field>
