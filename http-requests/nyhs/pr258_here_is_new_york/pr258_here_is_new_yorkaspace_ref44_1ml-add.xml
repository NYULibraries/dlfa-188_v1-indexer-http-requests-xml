    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In April of 2002, here is new york launched its oral history initiative, Voices of 9.11. Begun initially as a way for here is new york photographers to tell stories of their images, the project quickly expanded to include 9/11 survivors, family members, first responders, medical workers, area residents and workers, and others. A makeshift video booth was erected at here is new york's 1105 Sixth Avenue exhibition. The speaker controlled the recording; there were no time limits or restrictions on subject matter. When the Sixth Avenue location closed in June, the video booth was relocated to the Prince Street gallery. Later locations included Washington, D.C. (at the Corcoran Gallery exhibit), Shanksville, PA (the crash site of United flight 93), Staten Island, and the Pentagon in January 2003. Some of the testimonies were exhibited in the Prince Street gallery, the Corcoran, and the Pentagon.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are 580 testimonies (some speakers recorded twice), which are not numbered consecutively. Videos are arranged by location of recording, then listed by file number and name of speaker. Files are in Quicktime format and vary in length. See the database on HINY computer terminal (and in finding aid binder) for a complete list of Voices of 9.11 participants, as well as information on recording location and participants' contributions to here is new york and roles in 9/11 (if any). The database was created by N-YHS using primarily information from a here is new york database. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Electronic records for Voices of 9.11 include stills of participants in video booths and office files. Added material includes technical and other information provided by Ruth Sergel, who administered the Voices program for here is new york.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">See Series IV. Subseries I for video documentation of the Voices of 9.11 booth and Pentagon project.</field>
