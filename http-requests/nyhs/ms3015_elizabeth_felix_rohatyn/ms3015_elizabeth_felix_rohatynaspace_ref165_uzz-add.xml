    <field name="unitdate_teim">1980s-2016</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes the texts of various prepared speeches, testimony or other public remarks Rohatyn delivered, primarily from 2001 to 2009, with a few from earlier and later years. (Speeches made during his years as ambassador to France are found in Series IV.) The subjects of these remarks centered on the role of government in spending on infrastructure, economic relationships between the U.S. and Europe, capitalism, recollections of New York City's fiscal crisis, and other matters concerning political economy. Audiences included houses of the U.S. Congress, the 92nd Street Y, New York Public Library, the Institute of French Studies at New York University, City University of New York (CUNY), the U.S. Conference of Mayors, AFSCME, the Chicago Humanities Festival, the World Affairs Council, the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, COFACE, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, the Center for American Progress, the Economic Club of Chicago, the American Library in Paris, the National Governors Association, and others. Some of these texts are in French.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes Rohatyn's writings on mostly economic policy subjects. These take the form of clippings, photocopies and tear sheets from newspapers and other periodicals in which opinion pieces authored or co-authored by Rohatyn appeared. These also date primarily from 2000 to 2008. (Articles and clippings that refer to Rohatyn or quote him in passing are generally not found in this series, but are in the general reference files of Series I. Articles concerning New York's fiscal crisis are in Series II.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes extensive, various drafts of Rohatyn's memoirs, which were published under the title Dealings, but were also known by a working title of Money Games. These range from early drafts of chapters written in 2002 to the final versions published in 2010. There are also some drafts of Rohatyn's book on the history of major capital investments by the U.S. government, Bold Endeavors (working title: Investing in America), and portions of the French version of the book.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes published interviews of Rohatyn and profile articles centering on particular aspects of Rohatyn's career and perspective. There are copies of a videotape of a televised 2000 interview of Rohatyn by Charlie Rose. (The tape is restricted from use because the library lacks playback equipment, but the interview can be viewed, with a transcript, at the Charlie Rose show website: https://charlierose.com/videos/16773. That site also includes videos of several other appearances on the Charlie Rose Show that are not in this collection.)</field>
