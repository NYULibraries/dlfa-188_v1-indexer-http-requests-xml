    <field name="unitdate_teim">1975-2013</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes a few documents concerning New York's fiscal crisis of the mid-late 1970s. These include 21 rolls of 35mm photographic negatives relating to the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) taken in August 1978 by Carl Roodman. The most recognizable subject matter is the 8 August 1978 visit to City Hall by President Jimmy Carter where he signed legislation giving a $1.65 billion Federal loan guarantee to the city. There are photographs of the crowds, speakers at the podium, Carter's arrival and bill signing, and other such shots of the event. The specific subject matter of the other photographs is somewhat uncertain as to what is being depicted. But these appear to be photographs of the MAC staff at work in their offices in 2 World Trade Center; meetings and working sessions among various principals; discussions between MAC Executive Director Eugene Keilin, Rohatyn, and others; and possibly of the MAC Special Board Meeting of 11 August 1978, which took place at the midtown law office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the photographs, there are photocopies of press clippings, the issue of Newsweek featuring Rohatyn on its cover, a transcript of a US Senate hearing at which Rohatyn spoke, and articles, mostly from the 2000s, that included reflections on the events of the mid-1970s.</field>
