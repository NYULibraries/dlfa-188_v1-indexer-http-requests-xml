    <field name="bioghist_teim">The French Regional &amp; American Museum Exchange (FRAME), now known by the somewhat abbreviated name of French American Museum Exchange, was founded in 1999 by Elizabeth Rohatyn during her husband's, Felix Rohatyn's, tenure as U.S. ambassador to France.  The mission of the organization was, and is, to develop U.S.-France cultural exchanges in the context of museum collaborations for exhibitions, education programs, and the like. Elizabeth served as one of FRAME's  two Founding Co-Presidents, the other being Francoise Cachin, who was then the Director of the Mus√©es de France. FRAME's Founding Director was art historian Dr. Richard Brettell of the University of Texas.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">FRAME initially operated under the auspices of the Foundation for French Museums. In 2006, FRAME incorporated itself as a not-for-profit organization in the United States. FRAME operates through two organizational arms, one in the U.S. and the other in France, each headed by a President and a Director. A Board of Trustees heads the overall organization. Starting from a membership of about 18 museums in 1999, the organization included 30 museums in its consortium as of 2017.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">FRAME has sponsored about 21 exhibitions since its founding. The first exhibition was Made in the USA: American Art from 1908-1947, which toured at three museums in France. Most of the exhibitions since then made stops at museums in both the U.S. and France.</field>
