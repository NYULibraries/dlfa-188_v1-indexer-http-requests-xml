    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes files of Felix Rohatyn's correspondence, primarily from 2001 to about 2010, that is, the years after his ambassadorship to France. A significant theme running through much, perhaps most, of the correspondence is Rohatyn's advocacy for government investment in national infrastructure projects. This theme emerges in various contexts, notably in files concerning the transition team for New York Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer (2006), for a meeting of state investment officials convened by Rohatyn, California State Treasurer Philip Angelides and New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall regarding potential use of pension plans for infrastructure development (2002), long-term planning for New York under Mayor Michael Bloomberg (2002), rebuilding in New York after the attacks of 9/11 on the World Trade Center (2001), and the National Governors Association consideration of federal spending on building (2009). The files include remarks and articles by Rohatyn on the subject, with contextual documents such as clippings, government reports, and other material. (Standalone files of Rohatyn's writings and remarks are found in other series.)  The World Trade Center attacks themselves also emerge as a subject, as correspondents from both the U.S. and overseas write to Rohatyn expressing sympathy for the tragic events of 9/11.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rohatyn's advisory business interests are another theme of the series, though these appear in less depth. The series holds some early financial statements and required firm policy documents for Rohatyn's advisory firm, Rohatyn Associates LLC; a company overview of Lazard (2009); and a few Board meeting packets for companies at which Rohatyn served as a Board member. The economic relationship between the U.S. and Europe, Rohatyn's philanthropy, his support for certain politicians and public policy objectives, opposition to the death penalty, and awards and other recognitions bestowed on Rohatyn are among the other topics of the correspondence.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondents found in the series are principally from the worlds of finance/business and politics. There are several letters from President Bill Clinton, with Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush also appearing. Letters from Supreme Court Justices, Cabinet officials, senators, and congressmen and congresswomen are also found in the series, as are letters from New York City mayors, corporate executives, and international statesmen and businesspeople. Nonetheless, many of these letters are not especially substantive, often simply expressing thanks or other courtesy on a matter. Overall, the container list identifies at the folder level any notable individuals, particularly from the political arena, and subjects. Many of the letters to and from overseas correspondents are in French. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes several folders of general press clippings and tear sheets concerning business, economics, and other such matters, several of which refer to Rohatyn.</field>
