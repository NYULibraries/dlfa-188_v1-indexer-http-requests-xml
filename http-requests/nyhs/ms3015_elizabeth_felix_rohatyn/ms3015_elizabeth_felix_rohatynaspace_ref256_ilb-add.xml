    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The TMI files include concept papers, Board meeting minutes and materials, early by-laws, mission statements and strategic plans, fundraising efforts, and budgets. There are also program proposals and reports, including an evaluation of TMI's One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) pilot program (2008), the McKinsey &amp; Company's Connecting K-12 Schools to the Information Superhighway (1995), and TMI's first annual report (1995). There are a few files from TMI's earliest years in the mid-1990s, but most of the material dates from the 2000s. Coverage is inconsistent; for example, there are materials for only a few Board meetings in the 2000s. The subseries includes a folder of speeches given by Elizabeth from 1993-2000, not necessarily all concerning TMI. That same folder includes contact sheets of photographs of Elizabeth Rohatyn at an unidentified award ceremony and reception.</field>
