    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of 44 scrapbooks created by lawyer and diplomat Charles Hitchcock Sherrill (1867-1936). Covering the years 1884-1937, the scrapbooks contain clippings, correspondence, sketches, and ephemera (including postcards, photographs, ribbons, pins, membership cards, menus, and programs), all of which document Sherrill's work, social and political activities, travels, and interests. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sports, politics, travel, civic and social events, art, and theater are common themes throughout Volumes 1-35, which are chronological records of Sherrill's life from his undergraduate years at Yale until his death. Volume 36 consists mainly of letters of condolence to Sherrill's widow, George Gibbs Sherrill, after Sherrill's death in Paris in 1936. Volumes 37 and 38 contain material related to Sherrill's genealogical research.  Volumes 39-42 hold postcards from Sherrill's travels, including real photo postcards. Volume 43 contains mainly theater tickets and programs dated 1884-1888.  Volume 44 is mostly blank, but does have a few hand-drawn cartoons (seemingly made by Sherrill as a child) and some other illustrations.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most scrapbooks are labeled with dates and volume numbers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Charles Hitchcock Sherrill (1867-1936) was an American lawyer, diplomat, and sport officer.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sherrill was born April 13, 1867 in Washington, DC to New York state politician and Washington lobbyist Charles H. Sherrill and Sarah Fulton Wynkoop Sherrill. He studied at Yale University, and was an accomplished college athlete, winning the inter-collegiate 100-yard dash title four times and the 220 yard dash three times. In 1888, he became the first person to use a crouch start in track and field sprints.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After graduating from Yale law school, Sherrill practiced law in New York City. He married George Barker Gibbs (1870-1947) in 1906, and they had one child, Gibbs Wynkoop Sherrill, born in 1908. Active in Republican politics, Sherrill coordinated some New York City campaign events for Presidents McKinley and Taft, and was appointed US Ambassador to Argentina from 1909 to 1910. He organized and was grand marshall of the 1916 Citizens Preparedness Parade, and during World War I, he was made Adjutant General of New York State, head of the New York National Guard. He later served as US Ambassador to Turkey from 1932 to 1933.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Outside of his work in law and politics, Sherrill's interests included travel, art, history, and sports. He wrote a number of books, on subjects ranging from diplomacy and world affairs, to stained glass, to his own family history. In one of his books, "The Purple or the Red" (1924), dedicated to Benito Mussolini, Sherrill argued for popular monarchy as an acceptable secondary option to republican government as a means to prevent the spread of Bolshevism.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sherrill was an active participant in the social and civic life of New York City. He belonged to the Society of the Sons of the Revolution, and was a founding member of the National Arts Club. He was a member of social clubs such as the the Union League, the St. Nicholas Skating Club, the Grolier Club, and the Yale Club. He also helped coordinate the campaign to complete the building of NYC's Cathedral of St. John the Divine in the mid 1920s.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sherrill's ardent enthusiasm for sports never waned. In 1892, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the New York Athletic Club. Active in Yale's Athletic and Alumni Associations, he helped organize the first Yale-Oxford Track Meet in 1894, and traveled to it annually, often serving as an official. From 1922 to his death, Sherrill was a member of the International Olympic Committee and played a vital role in organizing the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 1935, during the preparations for the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Berlin, Sherrill met twice with Hitler. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sherrill died suddenly in France on June 25, 1936.</field>
