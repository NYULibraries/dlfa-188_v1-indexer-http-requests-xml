    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Office Files appear to have been maintained over time by the administrative assistants to the Library Director, including Mary Nathanson, Xenia Zielyk, Grace Hernandez, Patricia Contino, Sarah Grossman and others, though other files were likely mixed into these over time. Accordingly, the files hold a combination of management-level material (e.g., budgets and expense information, grants and grant proposals, annual or other management progress reports, activity statistics, staff memos, correspondence, general exhibition planning, fellowship proposals, donations, and acquisitions) as well as routine transactional documents (e.g., invoices for Baker &amp; Taylor, Readmore, Blackwell, RLG/RLIN and other library purchases and subscriptions). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is considerable overlap in the subject matter of this series and the next, Series III. Librarian and Curatorial Files. There likely is no sharp distinction between them, but generally the content of the files in Series III seems more attributable to particular leaders in the library, while these general files seem to have a more varied provenance, including miscellaneous files added to the series by archivists over time.</field>
