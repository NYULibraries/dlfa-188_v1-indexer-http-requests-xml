    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes correspondence concerning acknowledgements of donations accepted, offers of items for purchase or donation, and declined offers. These relate principally to the period 1976 to 2001, though there are some records for 1964-1975. Appraisals and related inventories for many of these donations are included through about 1986. Slips of paper with summary information by donor for the 1960s-1993 are in the series, as are a small number of acquisition related logs and system print-outs. The series also includes some records of library purchases, including purchases from 1979-1982 from Baker &amp; Taylor, Gale Research,  Heckman Bindery, university presses, subscription services, microfilm vendors, bookshops, publishers, and others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes those acquisition records found as standalone files during processing of the archive in 2016. References to acquisitions can also be found in the administrative files described in other series of this record group.</field>
