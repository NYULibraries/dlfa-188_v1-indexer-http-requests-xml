    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes sets of exhibition files that were maintained as standalone sets of files, or at least were found in that way during archival processing in 2016. The earliest files, from the 1940s and 1950s, appear to have been compiled at a later date by Wendy Shadwell and often include photographs of objects and the exhibition galleries. Later files often include photocopies of images of objects, but not of the galleries. Generally, the records are working files recording selections from the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (i.e., PPAC, or sometimes referred to as the Print Room) for museum and library exhibitions and the return of the items to the Print Room. Later files have the call slips for the selected documents. Many of the files have checklists, text, some research files, etc. The container list includes notes indicating those exhibitions that appear to have folders with more substantive or extensive documentation; the exhibition names used in the container list generally come from the original folder labels and likely do not match the actual exhibition titles precisely.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A particularly rich set of documents in this subseries relates to the 2013 exhibition The Armory Show at 100. The subseries holds the files of exhibition curator Marilyn Kushner, which include checklists, loan documentation, design plans, publicity, and other documents. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subsequent to the major processing project in 2016, additional files of exhibitions curated or organized by the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture from 2016 and later were transferred to the archives and these are included in the subseries as well.</field>
