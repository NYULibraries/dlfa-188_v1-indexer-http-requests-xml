    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC) series includes files maintained by the curators and directors of the department, commonly referred to in the records as the Print Room. These records principally concern exhibitions, both those curated by PPAC staff and those mounted by the museum and other library units to which PPAC contributed. The series also includes records of loans from the Print Room to other institutions. Also included are files concerning the collections (e.g., acquisitions, conservation, surveys, inventories, cataloging projects) and administrative matters (e.g., budgets, reports, memos, statistics).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Although prints, photographs and architectural plans have been collected at N-YHS since the nineteenth century, the institutional history of what is now known as the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC) begins more recently, in 1939. In that year, N-YHS opened its newly expanded and renovated building on Central Park West. Within the larger space, a new room was designated the "Map and Print Room" to house the collection (which included photographs even though the word was absent from the "M&amp;P" Room's title). More importantly, staff was hired and assigned to the care of these collections. At the same time, as the professional staff expanded throughout N-YHS, an organizational division developed between the Library and the Museum, each gaining its own head who reported to the chief executive officer, then called the Director. Prior to 1938, both branches of N-YHS's cultural resources reported to the Librarian. The Map and Print Room did not form a third branch, remaining within Library management.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over the following decades, the scope of the collections of the Map and Print Room evolved with institutional changes. Responsibility for architecture was added from the Manuscript Department while maps were transferred to the Reading Room. Drawings were transferred to the Museum while the Bella Landauer collection was added. Landauer's collection of business and advertising ephemera came to N-YHS in 1926. It too was housed in a separate room at Central Park West where Landauer continued to add to the collection and work on it as honorary curator until her death in 1960. By 1973, Wilson Duprey was no longer Curator of Maps and Prints, but simply Curator of Prints. Similarly, the Map and Print Room became known as the Print Room, a name that, although referring to a physical location,  has stuck informally over time to refer to the print, photograph and architecture collections and staff more generally. Certainly, in the records of this series and the institutional records overall, reference to Print Room will be commonly found, as in the title of the 1983 Print Room Collection Guide, an unpublished in-house finding aid. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The 1980s and 1990s, the years that are most extensively documented at present in this series, saw significant developments in the management of these collections. In terms of overall responsibility, in the early 1980s executive management considered transferring the Print Room collections from the Library to the Museum, but with no appetite for this within either department, the move did not take place. But this proved to be just a postponement as the transfer eventually did occur, in 1989. As part of a reorganization of N-YHS at that time, a number of functions were consolidated under the leadership of the new Museum Director, Holly Hotchner. With their transfer to the Museum, the Print Room collections and staff took on a new name, which remains today: the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC). </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">PPAC remained with the Museum only eight years, transferring back to the Library in 1998, where it remains today. Yet during that brief time, several important initiatives were implemented. In 1992, Helena Zinkham, a former curator of prints in PPAC, completed her work on a preliminary guide to the print, photograph and architecture collection. Initially only an in-house guide, funds were eventually raised for the publication of the Guide in 1997. Wendy Shadwell, who had been Curator of Prints since 1974, was joined by two additional experts, Mary Beth Betts as Curator of Architectural Collections (1990-1999) and Dale Neighbors as Curator of Photography (1987-1998). The extent of surveying and cataloging of the collections increased, as did exhibitions drawing on them, including McKim, Mead &amp; White's New York (1991) and Building City Hall: Competition, Construction and Context (1992). With the shift of PPAC back to the Library in 1998, PPAC continued both in its traditional role of providing material in support of exhibitions mounted by the Museum and Library, as well as installing exhibitions based on its collections. And under the leadership of Marilyn Kushner, PPAC's Curator and Head since 2006, the department has moved beyond these boundaries, perhaps most notably in Dr. Kushner's curatorship of the landmark Armory Show at 100 exhibition and its related Internet-based resources.</field>
