    <field name="unitdate_teim">1950s-2015</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries includes files of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century curators and directors of the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC), referred to commonly in the records and in the institution as the Print Room. Specifically, the subseries includes files of Curator of Prints Wendy Shadwell (1974-2002), Curator of Architecture Mary Beth Betts (1990-1999), Curators of Photographs Dale Neighbors (1987-1998) and Holly Hinman (1998-2004?), and Directors Pamela Dewey (1998-2000?) and Valerie Komor (2000-2003). The date ranges indicate the time the individual held the position, not necessarily the date range of the records held in their files. The records, although associated here with particular individuals, commonly hold documents from their predecessors and likely also include files of other individuals that mixed in over time.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files hold a range of materials concerning exhibitions, collections, conservation, and administrative matters. The container list provides summary descriptions for the principal subject content that is held within each box. The content can be further summarized as follows:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Wendy Shadwell's files include the broadest range of materials over the longest period of time. These files include internal memos, statistics, monthly reports, planning documents, budgets, consultant reports, collection inventories, acquisition documentation, reference inquiries, presentations to school groups, and conservation matters. The acquisition documents include index cards maintained by Shadwell's predecessor with notes on donations from 1969-1974.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mary Beth Betts's files center on the architectural collections and primarily include her working files for several exhibitions, especially McKim, Mead &amp; White's New York and Building City Hall: Competition, Construction and Context, which drew on the John McComb collection. Betts's files also include correspondence related to the architectural collections and grants, particularly for Cass Gilbert-related projects. Associated with Betts, though not directly attributed to her files in the container list, are cataloging worksheets for the McComb, Pollard, Davis and Cass Gilbert collections.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Dale Neighbors's files also include exhibition-related material, especially related to the 1995 gallery re-opening Treasury of the Past. Various exhibition possibilities are documented here, including some material for the planning in the late 1990s of a rotation of core New York City history-themed exhibitions. Likely in connection with one of these possibilities is a set of mounted newspaper photograph clippings apparently from the 1950s-1970s and at least in part from a series "New York's Changing Scene." Some administrative files relevant to the photograph collections are found here, including grants, acquisition possibilities, planning, and facilities. In connection with this last subject, there are three oversize plans from architect Richard Jansen for the existing and planned lay-out of the Print Room (1990). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Neighbors's files also hold documentation of two projects: Helena Zinkham's A Guide to Print, Photograph, Architectural and Ephemera Collections at N-YHS and consideration of creating a "daybook"/calendar with photographs and other images from the collections. The Zinkham records include correspondence, inventories, drafts, and other materials concerning the development of her unpublished preliminary Guide (1992) and the final published edition (1998).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Files from Neighbors's successor, Holly Hinman, primarily include information on various then-active photographers, likely in connection with potential acquisitions or exhibition. Many of the files have color slides, photographic prints, or digital media of the photographers' works; the container list entry includes the names of those photographers with such media in the files. Also included in the subseries are files concerning various surveys of the collections of negatives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Pamela Dewey and Valerie Komor files include grant proposals for conservation, digitization, and other matters; processing and project plans for cataloging and other description initiatives, including the monthly status reports for the Mellon-funded visual materials cataloging project; general correspondence and internal memos; collection descriptions, such as inventories, lists, surveys, counts, and acquisitions/donations; and administrative issues, such as the move of the Print Room to the 2nd floor. These files also include reports from the Mellon-funded studies on contemporary/contemporaneous collecting and information about the Landauer collection, such as the transfer of objects to the museum and a folder of clippings and original magazines with articles dating from the 1940s-70s, among other documents. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries also holds files concerning the "Here is New York" collection and, to a lesser extent, the 2007 exhibition of the same name.</field>
