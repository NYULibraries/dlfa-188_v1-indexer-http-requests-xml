    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes three principal sets of records from the library's conservation lab. First are the lab's files of outgoing loans and in-house exhibitions from 1989 to 2005. Second are the files (1990-1993) of Associate Librarian for Preservation Duane Watson and those of his colleague, Stacks Manager Christine Seeto. Finally, there are records of a daguerreotype (cased images) conservation survey from 1992-1993. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The outgoing loan files are generally fairly slender, with uneven content. Many include conservation treatment notes, but others include just the record of the approved loan or general correspondence  about the loans. Some post-2000 files include color slides of the loaned objects. In-house exhibition files tend to be more extensive, reflecting the broader involvement of the lab with these activities. These exhibition files commonly include not only condition and treatment reports, but also basic information about the objects in relation to the exhibition, including labels, checklists, display logistics, etc. The loan and exhibition files include folder lists at the front of each box.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Watson records are generally of a more administrative and broader nature, and less focused on individual objects. Watson's records include budgets, survey results, performance statistics, internal memos, conservation reference material, grants, and grant project activities. Seeto's records are concerned with stack surveys, movements of material within the stacks and other such logistical matters.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Aside from a bindery that operated from 1929 until about 1960, N-YHS had no in-house conservation unit until the mid-1980s when it began to build such a staff, initially for the museum. Professional conservators arrived in the library when paper and book conservation labs were opened in early 1989. In 1990, Duane Watson was hired as Associate Librarian for Preservation, a position he held until he left N-YHS in early 1993. In this position, Watson was responsible for overseeing object-level conservation efforts for the library and the management of the collection in the stacks. This latter responsibility was carried out in the early 1990s principally by Stacks Manager Christine Seeto. Down to the present (2016), N-YHS's library has continued to maintain a conservation lab, headed since the mid-1990s by chief conservator, Alan Balicki. Among the conservation staff's many responsibilities has been the assessment of outgoing loans of objects (e.g., conditions of objects, proper housing, conditions at the borrower site) and preparation of objects for in-house exhibitions.</field>
