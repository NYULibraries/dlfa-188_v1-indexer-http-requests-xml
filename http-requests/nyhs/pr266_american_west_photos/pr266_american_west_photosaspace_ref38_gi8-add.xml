    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III. 16 x 20 Inches is comprised of albumen photographs by William Henry Jackson and Andrew J. Russell from circa 1869-1900. Jackson's photographs were taken in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah and are primarily scenic views. These mammoth plate photographs are slightly larger than 16 x 20 inches. Most are labeled with titles and numbers, which included in the folder list when available. Six photographs of Colorado appear to be from a disbound book or album and are found on three double-sided pages. Titles are paired in the folder list to reflect the recto and verso images.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Andrew J. Russell photographs are of Utah and range from approximately 11 1/4 x 7 3/4 inches to 12 1/2 x 9 1/2 inches but are mounted on larger paper or board. Six of these photographs are labeled "From S. J. Sedgwick's Illuminated Lectures." These images are mounted on board printed with a decorative border and are hand labeled. The titles given in the folder list are taken from these handwritten notes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is also one photograph by an unidentified photographer of a horse being led across water in the mountains.</field>
