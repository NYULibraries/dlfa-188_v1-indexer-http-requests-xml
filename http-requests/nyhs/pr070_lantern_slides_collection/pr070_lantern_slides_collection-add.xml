    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection consists of 4,869 lantern slide photographs, most are 3 1/4 x 4 in. and were manufactured between 1860 and 1942. Many slides were connected with lecture presentations about New York and early American life sponsored by the New-York Historical Society. Some are also original photographs of views of Manhattan neighborhoods such as the Lower East Side, Greenwich Village, and Harlem as well as the borough of the Bronx. Images include bridges, rivers, transportation, churches, clubs, commercial and public buildings, monuments, parks, residences, schools, streets and theaters. Other interesting parts of the collection include a series on circus advertisements, several groups of cartoons and caricatures, and World War I American training camp slides. Some slides are copies of drawings that date back as far as the mid-17th century. Also in the collection are groups of slides manufactured outside the United States, including Germany, France, and Italy; most are tourist views. The Songs and Announcements sections of the collection contains slides used in theaters. The song slides were used to illustrate accompanying music and cover such genres as religious, popular, and patriotic music. The announcement slides provided reminders to viewers, such as removing their hats, or the slides advertised local businesses. Slides from amateur photographic clubs such as the American Slide Interchange, the Camera Club of New York, and the Society of Amateur Photographers of New York also account for a large portion of the collection.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Lantern Slides Collection contains 4,869 items, and makes up the bulk of the Transparency File (PR-70). The majority are 3 1/4 x 4 inch lantern slide photographs, many of which resulted from N-YHS' sponsorship, from 1900 to 1950, of numerous illustrated lectures about New York and early American life. Some of the slides in this collection are also original photographs of views of such Manhattan neighborhoods as the Lower East Side, Greenwich Village and Harlem. Well-represented photographers include Charles Simpson, Richard Hoe Lawrence and George E. Stonebridge. Among the dominant lantern slide manufacturers are the Charles Beseler Lantern Slide Co., Edward Van Altena, and T.H. McAllister-Keller and Co. Slides from amateur photographic clubs, such as the American Slide Interchange, the Camera club of New York, and the Society of Amateur Photographers of New York also account for a large portion of the collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains a series of Circus advertisements, several groups of Cartoons and Caricatures, and a group of World War I American Training slides. Also included are groups of slides manufactured in countries outside of the United States, including Germany, France and Italy. Most of these are tourist views, but a few were produced by unidentified amateur photographers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of the images in the collection are relevant to New York City, and include bridges, rivers and transportation (including railroad material). Borough-specific New York City material includes subjects such as Churches, Clubs, Commercial Buildings, Monuments, Parks, Residences, Schools, Streets, and Theaters. As a whole, this portion of the collection provides a thorough look at the streets, culture and history of New York city throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s. Some of the slides are also copy work produced during that time of drawings that date as far back as the mid-17th century, functioning as examples of the sorts of images which 19th and 20th century slide makers and sponsors felt were worthy of preserving.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Songs and Announcements sections of the collection contain slides which were used in the theaters. The announcements reminded viewers to take off their hats or go to a nearby ice cream shop after the show. The song slides were used to illustrate accompanying music, and cover such genres as religious, popular, and patriotic music.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lantern slides are positive images on glass that were intended to be projected for viewing. In most cases, the emulsion is protected by a second piece of thin glass, and the unit is secured around all four edges with black paper tape. Many are individual, hand-painted works.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lantern slides came into wide use in the United States after the 1860s. During the 1890s, magic lanterns were in high fashion as an extension of photography. Lantern slide shows, or the magic lantern, became popular home entertainment and served as an accompaniment to speakers on the lecture circuit. Lantern slides reached their popularity about 1900 and continued to be widely used until the 1930s, when they were gradually replaced by the more convenient 35-mm slides.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The collection's accession dates span from 1911 to 1955. See the Quarterly/Annual Reports in the Transparency File for descriptions of specific group accessions.</field>
