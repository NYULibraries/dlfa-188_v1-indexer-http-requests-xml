    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials are from Lee Wohlfert's time as a People writer, including article drafts and research, news clippings, memorandum, photographs of Arthur Hailey for a 1973 profile, and materials for Miss America Pageant officials. Also includes copies of books by Stephen Gaskin, Tom Wolfe, and Jacqueline and Lee Bouvier; these were used for article research. The articles-related materials are focused on culture and fashion, including published interviews with Sean Young, Diane Von Furstenberg, and Lee Radziwell. Miss America Pageant materials cover the national level and Mississippi. Some notebooks are included in the general articles research with interview questions and thoughts inside; one untitled, undated notebook was found unassociated with any materials and is foldered by itself.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Includes a copy of Wohlfert's 1978 interview with Anne Beats about Saturday Night Live (SNL) published in Your Place magazine, a McCall's publication aimed at young people of both sexes that was published for only five issues. It is unconnected to Time Inc., and the interview was done as a freelance assignment. Wohlfert continued to collect information on the SNL cast through 1979, including internal memos with People editor Jim Seymore about getting an interview with some of the notoriously press-shy cast. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lee Wohlfert started as a People magazine writer in 1974 and was made Assistant Editor in February 1983. She continued to write articles following her promotion and the materials in this series are concerned only with her writing. She is credited as Lee Wohlfert-Wihlborg in the People masthead.  Wolhfert also freelanced for publications such as Town &amp; Country, Harper's Bazaaar, and LA Style. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">She left People in 1986, but continued to freelance for the magazine until 1990. While she published under the last names "Wohlfert" and "Wohlfert-Wihlborg" after 1983, she currently goes by Wohlfert.</field>
