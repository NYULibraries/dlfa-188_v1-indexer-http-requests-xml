    <field name="abstract_teim">One letter, 3 pages typed, with handwritten postscript, from "Margaret" (Margaret Hincks Morse, according to the donor of the letter, who was Morse's great-granddaughter) to "Darling Mother." Though not explicit, references in the letter suggest that it was written to Morse's mother-in-law, Margaret Duncan (Ely) Morse, whose husband, Anson Daniel Morse, had died on March 13, two weeks before the date of this letter. Margaret Hincks Morse opens the letter with an extended and highly favorable description of a Montessori school she has found and in which she has enrolled her two children, Duncan and Florence. She goes on to discuss the children, their differing temperaments, and their positive responses to the Montessori experience. From there, Morse briefly discusses her search for a new housekeeper, a family gathering, seeing Caruso and Marie Rappold in "Aida," and other casual matters. As the letter approaches its conclusion, Morse's tone shifts toward one of concern about her mother-in-law, indirectly referring to the stress on her of Anson Morse's recent death. Morse urges her mother-in-law to take on a nurse to help her and "Margie" and Margie's baby (the donor identified Margie as ornithologist Margaret Morse Nice). Morse concludes her letter and postscript by urging her mother-in-law to come visit the family in New York.
