    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Museum of Biblical Art records include curatorial, administration, and exhibition files from 1997 to 2015. The documents concern MoBiA's time as an independent museum from 2005 to 2015 as well as its original status as the Gallery at the American Bible Society from 1997 to 2004.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Due to the fact that MoBiA had no permanent collections of its own, the majority of the files relate to the organization of exhibitions. These include loan agreements, checklists, and installation plans as well as other details regarding the realization of MoBiA's displays. The amount of records regarding each exhibition differs greatly, but the majority of the files include numerous documents concerning the acquisition of art works and their layout in the museum.  The majority of the files pertain to exhibitions organized once MoBiA became its own institution, however, there are a few items that date back to its time as the Gallery at the American Bible Society.  There are also records regarding the creation of books and symposiums to accompany some of the exhibitions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition, the records include information related to the administration of MoBiA. There are agendas, minutes, and meeting notes from the decade long work of the Board of Trustees. These pertain to topics such as finances, programs, and the eventual dissolution of the board in 2015. Items also concern other administrative factors of MoBiA's such as financial, strategic, and operational planning. Although the museum was officially independent from the American Bible Society, MoBiA still received many donations from ABS and was located within their New York City headquarters. Therefore, there are also files related to the relationship between the two institutions. These include financial agreements as well as lease contracts. There are also records regarding meetings in which both MoBiA and ABS discuss what type of relationship they should have and how they should move forward with it.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other materials include press clippings about both individual exhibitions and MoBiA in general as well as pamphlets, postcards, and brochures for each of the museum's exhibitions.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Museum of Biblical Art (MoBiA) was an institution located in New York City that sought to remain religiously neutral while pursuing its key mission of providing insight into the ways that the Bible has influenced art. It was originally created as the Gallery at the American Bible Society in 1997 with Ena Heller placed as its director. It was not until 2005 that it officially became its own independent institution and was renamed as the Museum of Biblical Art. However, despite the fact that MoBiA was a separate institution from the American Bible Society (ABS), it continued to be located within the ABS headquarters and received a large majority of its funds from ABS as well.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Its first exhibition was "Coming Home! Self-Taught Artists, the Bible and the American South." Due to that fact that MoBiA did not house a permanent collection of its own, most of its exhibitions over the next decade required loans from other institutions and artists. Other exhibitions included "Biblical Art in a Secular Century," "Chagall's Bible," and "Louis C. Tiffany and the Art of Devotion." Such exhibitions included a broad range of works from several different regions and time periods. Its last exhibition was "Sculpture in the Age of Donatello: Renaissance Masterpieces from Florence Cathedral" which featured pieces that had never before been shown in the United States.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 2015, the American Bible Society moved its headquarters from New York City to Philadelphia. Since MoBiA had previously been able to rent its location in ABS for a very minimal price, the museum now found it a challenge to find a new location that it would be able to afford. Therefore, by the summer of 2015, the Museum of Biblical Art officially closed due to financial constraints.</field>
