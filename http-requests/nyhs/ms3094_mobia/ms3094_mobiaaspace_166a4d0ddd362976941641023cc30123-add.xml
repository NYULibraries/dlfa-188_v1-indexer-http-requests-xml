    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes records related to the planning and actualization of several exhibitions that the Museum of Biblical Art displayed. The majority of the files relate to exhibitions that were put on after MoBiA became its own organization in 2005. Therefore, there are relatively few records regarding exhibitions that were on display when it was the Gallery of the American Bible Society from 1997 to 2004. Nevertheless, the number of exhibitions following this period appears to be complete, as there are no gaps in the exhibitions until the museum closes in 2015.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The amount of information regarding each exhibition varies in quantity. However, generally, most files will include the loan agreements, condition reports, checklists, exhibition contracts, shipping information, and climate reports for each exhibition. In addition, there may be label designs, research documents, wall layout plans, and installation strategies as well. There is also much correspondence related to the acquisition of certain works of art and the requests to other institutions for such pieces. If an exhibition travelled beyond its time at MoBiA, then there will be files pertaining to the planning and the condition reports related to that. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Catalogues were prepared for some of the exhibitions that MoBiA organized and the files hold a copy of those. There are also records related to the development of the catalogue, including planning for works to be featured, the photos to be used, and the scholars that would participate in its publication. At times, there are also files regarding the organization of symposiums and lectures for an exhibition. If there are any unusual or significant additional items in the files, then these will be noted in the Scope and Content note at the folder level below.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are some exhibition files that include photographs, however, these are not of the actual exhibitions. Instead, the photos are largely included with condition reports in order to detail certain aspects of a piece for such reports.</field>
