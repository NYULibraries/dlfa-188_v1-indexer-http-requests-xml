    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of material that documents the creation of the Names Parapet, one of the most difficult challenges in the design of the 9/11 Memorial. The names of the 2,982 individuals killed in the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the bombing on February 26, 1993 are inscribed in bronze around the perimeters of the Memorial pools, which are located in the footprints of the Twin Towers. 
 
The names are arranged by where victims were and who they were with, and further requests for specific names to be located next to one another were made by the families of those who were lost.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series is largely made up of scrolls and strips of paper with various arrangements of the names of the victims. </field>
