    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Board of Trustee meeting minutes are complete for the period from 1930 to 2015. Although there are no minutes for Board of Trustee meetings held prior to 1930, there are minutes of the Executive Committee meetings dating back to 1917 (see Subseries I.3, below).  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Minutes typically list meeting attendees and discuss nomination and elections of new members, obituaries and memorials for deceased members, and reports of the various board committees. Financial and operational matters are also frequently included, particularly matters relating to the various clubhouses and camps. There are some interesting references to membership issues, including ethnic and racial tensions and the changing demographics of the clubhouse neighborhoods, particularly in the 1950's and 1960's. There are also reports on clubhouse activities and special events. A list of "important items mentioned in Trustee minutes" through 1984, compiled by BCNY, is included in Box 6, Folder 6.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is some duplication of records in the Board of Trustee minutes, reflecting their original arrangement. In some instances (for example, in the 1940's), Executive Committee Minutes are included with board minutes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Note that access to Board of Trustee meeting minutes is restricted for 35 years from the date of creation. Materials that were subject to restriction at the time this finding aid was created are identified in the box and folder list. </field>
