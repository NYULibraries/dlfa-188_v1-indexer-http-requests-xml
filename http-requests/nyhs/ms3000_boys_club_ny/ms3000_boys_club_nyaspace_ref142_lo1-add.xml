    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries I.3: Board Committees</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries includes minutes of Board Committee meetings as well as committee files with drafts, memoranda and correspondence relating to issues discussed at meetings.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Executive Committee was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization.  The Committee met monthly and made recommendations to the Board of Trustees on major issues facing the organization.  Minutes often include more detailed discussions of issues that are subsequently addressed in meetings of the Board of Trustees. They generally include summary reports from the other Board committees and from various members of the executive staff. Topics include budgetary and financial issues, clubhouse activities, building operations, expansion and divestments, camps, membership, events, and virtually every other aspect of BCNY administration.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In 1916, a Ways and Means Committee was created to relieve BCNY's treasurer of sole responsibility for collecting current funds. In the early years, the Ways and Means Committee often met jointly with the Executive Committee, and minutes of its meetings are included with the Executive Committee minutes.   </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Administration Committee was formed in the early 1950's to provide coordination and oversight of the activities of the other committees, and to focus on long-term planning. Since the Administration Committee also assumed responsibility for oversight of executive operations, these files are a good source of information about personnel issues.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Finance Committee had responsibility for investments of funds.  Minutes discuss fund performance, investment strategies, and related issues.  Financial statements are frequently attached.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Education Committee files are concerned with BCNY's program to place members in private preparatory schools and colleges. This program was established in 1952 with money donated by trustee Victor Morawetz.  Minutes discuss scholarships, IQ testing, selection of schools, and the performance of participants. There is also discussion of the placement of "Negro" boys.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Evaluation Committee was formed to assess the programs and activities of BCNY in the 1970's. Files include memoranda assessing BCNY's overall goals and challenges, which provide a detailed and interesting snapshot of the organization in the early 1970's.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Building Committees were responsible for supervising the activities and expenditures of their respective clubhouses.  Files include descriptive information about the activities of both members and staff.  There is also statistical information about membership and participation in programs, and analysis of the effects of ethnic, racial and social trends. There is some financial and budgetary information about the buildings as well.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Note that access to Committee meeting minutes is restricted for 35 years from the date of creation. Materials that were subject to restriction at the time this finding aid was created are noted in the box and folder list. </field>
