    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection, assembled and donated by Holly Schepisi and Paul Garfinkel, consists of photographs from three discrete photographers/photo agencies.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The first set of photographs is from the Black Star Agency, and contains images of prominent people and events of the 1970s and 1980s. Photos include actors such as Farrah Fawcett, Richard Gere, and Diane Keaton; political figures including President Jimmy Carter, Anwar Sadat, and Menachem Begin; and royals including Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and Princess Caroline of Monaco.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A second set of photos are portraits of Marilyn Monroe dated 1945-1953, taken by André de Dienes. These portraits are accompanied by certificates of authenticity from the curator and manager of the de Dienes archive. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The final set are photographs by photojournalist Ken Regan, including behind the scenes images of ABC News broadcasts, 1981-1983, and photographs of the extended Kennedy family at work, at political and social events, and at the family compound, 1971-1985. Most of these images are of Ted Kennedy, though there are also photos of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, John F. Kennedy Jr., Caroline Kennedy, Joe Kennedy Jr., and Pat Lawford.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Black Star Agency was founded in 1935 by German Jewish refugees Kurt Safranski, Ernest Mayer and Kurt Kornfeld, who fled Berlin during the Nazi regime. They were innovators in Germany's picture press and publishing world, and brought with them a wealth of knowledge about photography and photojournalism. Their New York-based agency commissioned and brokered the use of photographs that documented important events, people of note, and human interest stories. One of their first major clients was Henry Luce's Life magazine, founded in 1936.
In 1964, the company was sold to Howard Chapnick, a photographer who had joined the agency after his service  in WWII. He led the agency for the next 25 years.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ken Regan (d. 2012) worked for over five decades documenting pop culture, sports, foreign conflicts, and other current events. Credited with over 200 magazine covers, Regan was most well-known for a discretion and professionalism which earned him intimate shooting access to famous politicians, musicians, and other celebrities. Regan also covered major events for magazines such as Time, Sports Illustrated, Life, and Newsweek. In the 1970s he founded Camera 5, an agency of 15 photographers who covered wars, riots and demonstrations, and other national and international hard news and human interest stories.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">André de Dienes (1913-1985) was a Hungarian American fashion photographer best known for his early portraits of the actress Marilyn Monroe.</field>
