    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I contains photographs and other material relating to "On the Beat 1975-1979: Women in the NYPD," an exhibition of Hoffer's photographs of some of the first female NYPD officers on the job. The photographs are arranged in categories originally determined by the photographer. For descriptions of her subjects, see the container list below.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are 131 gelatin silver photographs in Series I (105 are 5x7-inch prints; 25 are 11x14-inch prints), as well as 8 contact sheets with 160 images, some labeled "Women Partners," for which there are no prints in the present collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I also includes a CD of images and interview texts, and the photographer's self-published photobook On the Beat 1975â€“1979, which reproduces photos and selections from the interviews, all of which were performed with the women represented in the collection. Note that some of the photographs present in the collection do not appear in the book; and, conversely, some of the images in the book are not represented in the collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A booklet, which includes some of Hoffer's photos, was added to the collection by Hoffer in 2022.</field>
