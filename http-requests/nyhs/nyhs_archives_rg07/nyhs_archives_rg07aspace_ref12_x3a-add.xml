    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Subject Files include clippings and tearsheets from newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and other publications concerning various N-YHS matters. The bulk of the files relate to exhibitions or other N-YHS programs and events. Many of the clippings in the exhibition files are articles about or reviews of the program, but many clippings are just brief notices from published event listings and the like. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the specific exhibition or other topical files, each year in the series from 1970 forward includes a file of general clippings. These include a broad mix of subjects, from general institutional matters to passing references to N-YHS in articles or published listings to items of only tangential interest. N-YHS's financial difficulties and other organizational issues of the 1980s and 1990s attracted much press coverage; these articles are primarily found in topical files, but some are in the general clippings as well. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although the bulk, by far, of the series consists of original or photocopied clippings from sources outside of N-YHS, some of the files also include documents from N-YHS's Public Relations Department, such as press releases and summaries of references in the press (called press round-ups or coverage reports), especially for events such as exhibitions. Some documents include brief staff notes, internal memos, or press correspondence related to coverage, especially for exhibitions. A very few folders include exhibition checklists, labels, booklets, or other material directly connected to the event; documents of this kind are noted at the folder level in the container list.</field>
