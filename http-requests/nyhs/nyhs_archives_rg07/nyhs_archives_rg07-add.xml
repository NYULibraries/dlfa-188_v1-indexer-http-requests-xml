    <field name="abstract_teim">The New-York Historical Society press clippings record group includes material compiled regularly by N-YHS into scrapbooks, subject files and binders from published sources from about 1870 to 2014, with some clippings as early as 1843. Subjects include exhibitions, lectures, publications, and other programs; acquisitions of new collections or objects; building construction, management controversies, and other institutional matters; and leadership changes, obituaries, and other matters connected to individuals. The record group provides insight from over a century into the extent of press coverage of N-YHS and press perceptions of the organization and its programs, and a broad overview of events in N-YHS's history as presented in the press.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The New-York Historical Society press clippings record group includes material compiled regularly by N-YHS from published sources from about 1870 to about 2014. The record group also holds some clippings from as early as 1843. The material includes clippings and tearsheets from newspapers, general interest magazines, museum, antiques, and other specialist journals, and other print matter. These clippings are compiled in 28 boxed volumes of scrapbooks and, from about 1970, in subject-oriented files and binders. Although perhaps most of the clippings are from New York sources, there are a substantial number of clippings from other U.S. cities and even from the international press (accordingly, many of these are not in English). The record group also holds a small number of reprints and copies of essays written about N-YHS and its collections in books and journals. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subjects of the articles in the record group are wide-ranging. Topics relate to N-YHS exhibitions, lectures, publications, and other programs and events; acquisitions of new collections or objects; implementation of major new initiatives (e.g. the Field Exploration Committee, circa 1917-1938); building construction on Central Park West (1900s and 1930s); management controversies (e.g., Mrs. Van Rensselaer's reform movement of circa 1917 and the financial difficulties of the 1980s-1990s); and recognitions, leadership changes, obituaries (e.g., the death of Director Alexander Wall in 1944), and other matters connected to individuals. Overall, the record group provides insight into the extent of press coverage of N-YHS, press perceptions of the organization and its programs, and a broad overview and narrative of events in N-YHS's history as presented in the press.</field>
