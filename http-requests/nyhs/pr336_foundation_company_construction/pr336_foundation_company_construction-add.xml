    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains five mounted construction photographs. The locations of only two sites are positively identified: the Trinity Building (111 Broadway; see Folder 1) and the Woolworth Building's engine room (233 Broadway; see Folder 4). Only two of the images bear photographer's imprints on the reverse: Wurts Bros. of New York took the Woolworth Building engine room view (Folder 4), and the Chicago Architectural Photographing Co. took the unidentified view that possibly shows construction of the Chicago and Northwestern Terminal (now called Ogilvie Transportation Center) in Chicago (Folder 2). The Foundation Company worked on the Chicago and Northwestern Terminal for George A. Fuller Company, Builders, whose sign appears in the lower right corner of the photograph.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Foundation Company, headquartered in the early twentieth century at 115 Broadway (with branch offices in Chicago, New Orleans, and Montreal), specialized in constructing building foundations by "pneumatic caissons, open caissons, sheet-piling (either wood or steel), concrete piles, hollow steel pipe filled with concrete, wooden piles, cofferdams, and various other approved methods." The roster of their projects in the 1913 issue of Sweet's Catalogue of Building Construction, Architects and Builders Edition includes many prominent Manhattan structures, among them the Standard Oil Building (26 Broadway), Wall Street Exchange (43 Exchange Place), Western Union Building (Broadway and Dey Street), Municipal Building (1 Centre Street), U.S. Realty and Trinity Buildings (115 and 111 Broadway), and the Woolworth Building (233 Broadway). For more on the Foundation Company's role in constructing the latter, see Gail Fenske, The Skyscraper and the City: The Woolworth Building and the Making of Modern New York (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008).</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Gift of Katie Huxford, 2016. These photographs descended to the donor from her paternal grandfather, an Irish immigrant pipefitter, whom she believes worked for the Foundation Company or the George A. Fuller Company.</field>
