    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III. Works by Others includes two folders of material that is not by Anderson. These are included here because they were given along with material that became the heart of this collection, and are either works picturing Anderson, or created by other members of his family. An 1887 pen drawing by E. C. Lewis is a copy of a self-portrait Anderson engraved on wood. One folder contains an engraving by Anderson's daughter, Ann Anderson Maverick (ca. 1810-1863), several by her husband Andrew's uncle, Peter Maverick (1780-1831), and an engraving by Peter's daughter, Emily Maverick Stoutenburgh (1803-1850). These engravings were in the possession of Mary Emmeline Halsey, Anderson's granddaughter and were given with the rest of her Anderson material.</field>
