    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">circa 1890's-1900's</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of approximately 150 photographs (gelatin silver prints and cyanotypes) relating to the Howe family of the Bronx and Hazelton, PA.  Most likely taken by Alfred Howe in the 1890's and 1900's, the photographs show family members, their residences and neighborhoods, and some machinery designed and manufactured by Frederick Howe.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs of the Bronx residences, located on Trinity Avenue, show the area before the streets were graded.  The Howe property apparently encompassed 15 city lots, and was perched on a rocky precipice opposite Lebanon Hospital.  In addition to photographs, the collection includes an application to reduce property taxes filed in 1907, which asserts that there was no wagon road to the property, and that in winter coal had to be hoisted up the hill by a steam derrick and then moved across the property by hand on a small railway (built and engineered by Frederick Howe).  The application also describes the damage resulting to an old frame house that was moved 170 feet across the property.  Photographs, including some that were filed with the application, show the houses, the steam derrick and the railway.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other Bronx images include a large cyanotype of the elevated train station at East 145th Street, and photographs of damage to Frederick Howe and his house following a fire in May, 1909.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs of Hazleton, PA, include street views, shots of the homes where Alfred Howe's children were born, and interior shots of a local grocer.   Also included are photographs of coal mining equipment, some of it designed and built by Frederick T. Howe.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Edward Howe appears to have settled in the Bronx in the early to mid-19th century. Born in Maine in 1820, he married Nannie (also given as Narrie) Mack, and they had three sons, all born in New York: Edward E. (1864),  Frederick (1865) and Alfred (1872).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Howes were a musical family.  The elder Edward listed his occupation in census reports as "music teacher," and two of his three sons (Edward E. and Alfred) also became professional musicians. By 1900, Edward E. was married, had four children, and was living in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, where he taught music.  Alfred, who also married, remained in the Bronx, and apparently worked as a musician in the theater and aboard ships.  Alfred and his wife had one daughter and lived in what seems to have been the original Howe home at 575 Trinity Avenue.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Although Frederick Howe was also musically trained, he was employed as an architect and draughtsman in the Topographical Bureau of the Borough of the Bronx.  Never married, Frederick lived with his mother at 565 Trinity Avenue in the Bronx, next door to Alfred.  Described as "rather eccentric," Frederick engineered and built a series of small railroads on the Bronx property that the family used to haul coal.  Frederick is also credited with originating the idea of a parkway linking the three boroughs, although his plan was never realized.  He committed suicide in 1911.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Howe family members were apparently all vegetarians and in 1887, Edward E. Howe published a vegetarian cookbook.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Alfred Howe sold the two Trinity Avenue homes in 1925.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The photographs in this collection were most likely taken by Alfred Howe, and were donated to the New-York Historical Society by Edmund Bramhall Child III, a collector and long-time Bronx resident.  Child was himself a musician and amateur actor and may well have been a friend of the family.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> Special thanks to N-YHS librarian Joseph Ditta for his invaluable assistance in researching the Howe family.  </field>
