    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II makes up the bulk of this collection. It consists of black &amp; white and color negatives, contact prints, black &amp; white and color photographs, and color slides.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are images of steel workers restoring the Brooklyn Bridge and of the New York City skyline taken from a high vantage point on the bridge as Dogancay was known to climb as the workers did. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are numerous images that display the iron workers climbing the iron skeletons of buildings, often without wearing a harness. Iron workers are also shown in their downtime on a break or eating lunch.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Lipstick Building (885 Third Avenue in Manhattan) is a highlight of this series. There are images of the demolition of previous structures, the rebuilding of the foundation, the various stages of construction (especially of the iron skeleton) from within the structure as well as from many different viewpoints from surrounding streets and buildings. Images of the completed Lipstick Building are also included. The Citicorp Building (also known as Citicorp Center or as 601 Lexington Avenue) is also a highlight of this series; because of its proximity to the Lipstick Building it is found in a great deal of images. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Construction images that did not include these two buildings were also taken in the general Midtown Manhattan area, except for some images toward the end of the series that were taken in France. Also at the end of the series there are larger photographs of similar subject matter found throughout this series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the binders that the work was originally organized in were labeled 'Iron Workers' on the outside while inside of the binders many of the sleeves of negatives had 'steel workers' written on them. It is uncertain if the terms 'iron workers' and 'steel workers' were purposely being distinguished or if they were used interchangeably. When not specifically documented as 'iron workers' or 'steel workers', they are referred to as workers in the following Scope and Contents Notes. In some cases these workers are general construction workers, but it is likely that many of the unlabeled workers are iron workers or steel workers.</field>
