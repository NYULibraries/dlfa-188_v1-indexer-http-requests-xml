    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series IV: Scrapbooks and Ephemera</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists primarily of annual scrapbooks containing ephemera relating to the club's events and activities. For conservation purposes, most of the scrapbooks have been disbound and re-housed in folders. Examples of the original binding are included in the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The scrapbooks contain items relating to the club's internal activities (meetings, member applications and lists, annual reports, annual dinners, etc.) as well as club-sponsored public events including concerts and recitals, art exhibits, and lectures on drama, literature and other artistic topics. Many examples of the drama committee's reports on plays (described in the Biographical/Historical note of this finding aid) are included. There is also ephemera relating to the club's annual Christmas Festival. Some scrapbooks contain material relating to the Edward MacDowell Memorial Association in New Hampshire, including programs for an elaborate historical pageant performed in his honor.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials represented include programs, notices, announcements, bulletins, invitations, coupons, menus, postcards and reviews and other types of clippings. Several scrapbooks that are comprised almost entirely of newspaper clippings were not disbound and were assigned volume numbers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also includes several folders of loose ephemera and a small amount of correspondence found in some of the club's early minutes books.</field>
