    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Subject Files contain research materials related to common headline news topics that were used by reporters and researchers at magazines across Time Inc. Major topics covered include weapons and wars, geographic regions, populations of the United States and the Soviet Republic, domestic and international press organizations, United States elections, and word usage. Topics are frequently divided into sub-topics. For example, the files on New York City include boroughs, neighborhoods, government departments and agencies, parks, and extended folders on different streets. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Because these files were heavily used, there is some amount of misfiling.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of materials within the Subject Files are magazine and newspaper clippings. Other types of materials include article correction, correspondent dispatches, correspondence between reporters, correspondence between reporters and editors, correspondence from the general public to magazine editors, transcripts of interviews and speeches as well as press conferences, summaries of interviews, editorial outlines for articles, government and foreign policy overviews, press releases, press kits, event schedules and programs, lists of contacts and committee members as well as research sources, lists of award winners, pamphlets, drafts of articles, academic and scientific papers, financial reports, photos, congressional reports, and factsheets.
