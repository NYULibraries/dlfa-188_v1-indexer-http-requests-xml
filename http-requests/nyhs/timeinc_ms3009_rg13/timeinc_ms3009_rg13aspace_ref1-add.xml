    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Presidents Files, called Presidential Files by Time Inc., contain research materials regarding United States presidents used by reporters and researchers at various magazines across Time Inc. While a wide range of materials were collected, many of the items focus on important events that the president attended, any honors the president received prior to or during their presidency, domestic and foreign policies of an administration, public appearances and statements made by the president, White House staffing decisions, the finances of the incoming president, recreational activities that the president enjoyed, and details about their family.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">  Materials related to a specific president and a specific subject are in files that include the president's name and a subject as part of the titles. Subjects frequently collected include administration, advisers and assistants, appointments, awards and honors, cabinet, cartoons, congress, correspondence, domestic affairs, family, finances, foreign relations, inauguration, politics, polls, press relations, recreation, speeches, travel, and welfare. Files titled "Sketches" includes general material or biographical details or essays about the president and not drawings. Duplicates of items can be found in different folders for a president if the item relates to more than one topic.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">  The majority of materials are magazine and newspaper clippings. Other types of material include article correction forms, telegrams, correspondent dispatches, correspondence between reporters as well as correspondence with White House press representatives, transcripts of interviews and speeches, editorial outlines for articles, editorial policies, press releases, event schedules and programs, event invite lists, lists of White House staff, campaign pamphlets, biographical overviews, drafts of articles, academic papers and articles about the president and his policies, and financial reports.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">  According to the storage facility used by Time Inc., one box of John F. Kennedy files spanning from "Powers and Duties" to "Quotes" was destroyed in a flood.</field>
