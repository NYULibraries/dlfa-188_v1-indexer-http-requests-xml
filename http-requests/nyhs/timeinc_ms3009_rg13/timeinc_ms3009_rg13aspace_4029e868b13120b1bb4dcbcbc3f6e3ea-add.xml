    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Microfilm of the Time-Life News Service Correspondent Cables contains images of raw reporting and dispatches from correspondents along with some drafts of stories by New York City-based writers which were pulled by The Editorial Reference Library from its Bio, Company, and Subject Files. These reels were created in the mid-1960s so the materials imaged date prior to that. As hard copies of the Company Files were lost in storage facility fires, this microfilm is the only remaining examples of those files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> The Subject Rolls have two sets of alphabetically ordered reels. The first set is Roll 1 to 108 and the second set is Roll 109 to 268. The difference in sets might be date ranges since there is overlap in subject headings.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> On some of the original Edit Ref file folders in the hard copy series, stamping indicates that the Time-Life News Service Correspondent wires have been removed from the folder and microfilmed, noting which microfilm reel the material can be found on.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> In order to search the microfilm, there is an index on index cards. Each group of microfilm has cards listing contents in numerical order by reel number then alphabetically by name or heading. The index is stored onsite for easier reference. Several boxes of microfilm also include a copy of the corresponding index card.</field>
