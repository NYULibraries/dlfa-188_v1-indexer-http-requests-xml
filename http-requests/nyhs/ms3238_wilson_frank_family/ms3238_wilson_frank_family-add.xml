    <field name="scopecontent_teim">At the core of this collection are the over 80 World War I letters of Private First Class Frank Wilson, who wrote home to his mother, Annie (Damsey) Wilson and other family members, while in training at Camp Meade, Maryland, and from France, as a member of Company A, 310th Machine Gun Battalion, 79th Division, United States Army. Accompanying the letters is a pocket address book, which Wilson used as a diary between July and November 1918, and a smattering of wartime ephemera, like theatre programs from Paris, and menus for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner at Camp Meade, Maryland, 1917. Also present are scattered letters of the extended Wilson-Damsey family: Frank's brother, Harry Wilson (1899–1980), and his sister, Marjorie (or Margie) Wilson (1901–1982), and correspondents living in Colorado and, apparently, Lithuania, who wrote in Yiddish.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Morris (or Max) Wilson (1869–1942) and Annie Damsey (1875–1959) were late 19th-century immigrants from Lithuania to New York City. (The surname Wilson was originally "Shavelson" or "Savelson." Damsey was originally "Damsky.") They married in Manhattan in 1894 and had six children between 1895 and 1913, the oldest being Frank Wilson (1895–1979). Max was a building contractor and real estate owner (operating as Max S. A. Wilson Construction Co.) whose prosperity allowed the family the luxury of a brownstone at 210 East 79th Street. A series of financial setbacks forced their move to apartments in Harlem (326 West 119th Street) and Washington Heights (701 West 177th Street), and eventually to South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where they lived at 212 Warren Square in 1916–1922. Eventually they returned to Manhattan, residing first in Washington Heights, at 848 St. Nicholas Avenue, and, by 1940, at 301 West 107th Street. Max died in 1942, and Annie died in 1959.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Frank Wilson, after working with his father, continued in building management and construction ventures. Drafted into the United States Army on October 12, 1917, he served as a private, first class, in Company A, 310th Machine Gun Battalion, of the 79th Division. Shipped overseas in July 1918, he saw action in the Battle of the Argonne between September and November 11, Armistice Day. He was honorably discharged in April 1919. Frank Wilson married twice, first, to Ethel Lewis, who died in 1948, and second, to Lillian Weiler, who died in 1989. He died in 1979.</field>
