    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries includes royal appointments of office to George Clarke, Senior (as Secretary of the province of New York) and to Goldsboro Banyar (as Clerk of the Court of Chancery), along with a deputation from George Clarke, Junior appointing Banyar Deputy Secretary of the province.  The royal appointments are elaborate vellum documents with hand ornamentation and original seals still attached. Also included is a 1774 report to Governor William Tryon with information on the number of mines in the province, and its population (including a breakdown of whites and blacks), militia and government.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Auditor's Office correspondence with auditors Thomas Smith, Horatio Walpole and Robert Cholmondeley relates to the collection of quit-rents, payment of salaries and other matters concerning the official accounts of New York.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also included are Banyar's drafts of decisions issued on motions and cases heard in Chancery Court.  The Chancery Court was originally conceived as one that could rule on issues of fairness, and was not restricted to statutory law.  Cases typically involved estate and business disputes, the resolution of land disputes, and divorce and other family matters, such as the appointment of a guardian for a minor.  One case involved appointment of a committee to take care of a person "in a state of lunacy."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are also two bound volumes of minutes of Council proceedings relating to land transactions, spanning a two-year period from 1770 to 1772, and a list of wills filed in the Prerogative Office from 1769 to 1771.</field>
