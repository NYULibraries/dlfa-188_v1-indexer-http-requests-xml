    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries I.5: Patents, deeds and other land conveyances</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists mainly of legal documents for the acquisition and conveyance of real property, including Letters Patent (civil and military) and their supporting documents, deeds (generally using the English system of Lease and Release), mortgages, and bankruptcy indentures.  Also included are other papers relating to property and estates, such as tenant leases, bonds, surveys, and maps.  Most date from two periods: 1761-1775, and the 1790's. The conveyances record Banyar's personal land transactions as well as his legal business with clients, in New York City and Albany, and in upstate New York.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of the documents are Letters Patent (most with original seals attached) or conveyances and papers relating to them.  The Letters Patent, civilian and military, were issued to individuals or, more commonly, to groups, limited in non-military cases to 1000 acres per person but containing totals up to 50,000 acres -- moderate-sized grants compared to those of the 17th or early 18th centuries but substantial nonetheless. Parties to these indentures include many political and business leaders of the pre-Revolutionary era, such as Robert Livingston, John Tabor Kempe, John Morin Scott, Oliver Delancey, John Watts, Peter Van Schaack, James Duane, Alexander Colden, Governor William Tryon, and John Harris Cruger. Some of the post-Revolutionary transactions involve William Cooper, Henry Beekman, and William Lawrence.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the records relate to New York land grants in Vermont.  Often accompanied by papers proving titles, they involve property located in the area East of the Hudson River, then disputed by New Hampshire which later became parts of the state of Vermont. A Commission was established to adjudicate the competing claims, and New York agreed in 1790 to relinquish title to lands in Vermont in return for $30,000. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The transactions in this subseries illustrate the practices used to accumulate land for speculation, and in some cases give histories of particular lots or parcels in New York City and Albany. There are also many items relating to the military bounties authorized by the Proclamation of October 7, 1763.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The descriptions in the box and folder list are based on a calendar of the items prepared in the 1970's, which also provides additional background information.  This calendar has been included in Box 9A of the collection and is listed at the end of this subseries.</field>
