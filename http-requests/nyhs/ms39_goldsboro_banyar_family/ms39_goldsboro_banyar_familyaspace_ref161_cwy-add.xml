    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series II: Campbell P. White and Harriet (Banyar) White</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists primarily of the papers of Banyar's grandson-in-law, Campbell Patrick White, who married Banyar's granddaughter Harriet Banyar LeRoy in 1816.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">An Irish immigrant, Campbell Patrick White (1787-1859) became a successful New York merchant and Tammany politician. His father, Dr. John Campbell White, founded White and Sons Distillery in Baltimore, and Campbell and his older brother Robert White operated a New York branch of this business. Campbell White was also elected to Congress as a Jacksonian Democrat, serving from 1829 to 1835. Upon the death of Goldsborough LeRoy Banyar, Campbell White took over management of the Banyar family estate, including the family's real estate holdings. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also included in this series are some papers of Campbell White's brother, Robert White (d. 1847).  Robert White was for many years the cashier of the Bank of Manhattan, until he resigned around 1840 amid allegations of misfeasance.  A bachelor, Robert White was closely involved with his nephews, the children of Campbell and Harriet, and apparently lent them substantial amounts of money for their brokerage business. A letter to Robert from his father suggests that he may have had problems with alcoholism.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Papers include correspondence as well as financial and legal documents spanning the period from 1818 to the 1850's. Correspondence concerns the business dealings of Campbell and Robert White, including various financial transactions, the family distillery business, management of the Banyar estate, and the dispute with the Bank of Manhattan. Correspondence of Campbell White also touches on political issues, including currency and anti-rent legislation and the assassination attempt on Andrew Jackson. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Letters of frequent and/or significant correspondents with Campbell White have been foldered separately. These include business associates and agents William Slosson, Robert Ludlow, Marcus T. Reynolds, James Dexter, William Wason; diplomat David Baillie Warden; Baltimore lawyer and statesman Reverdy Johnson; Senator Levi Woodbury; and various others identified in the box and folder list.  Of particular interest are some letters sent by William Wason during the 1949 cholera outbreak, when Campbell White's family relocated to the Rockaways.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence of Robert White concerns business with the Bank of Manhattan and the ante-bellum cotton trade.  There are also several folders of other documents concerning the Bank of Manhattan, including some concerning the allegations against Robert White.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is correspondence from and between other family members, including Goldsborough LeRoy Banyar, John Campbell White (Campbell's father), John White (Campbell's brother), Henry White (Campbell's brother) and his son John White (Campbell's nephew), Joseph White (Campbell's brother) and his son William Pinkney Whyte (Campbell's nephew), and Campbell and Harriet's children John C. White, Mary White and Ann White. Letters address business as well as family matters; some of the letters relate to a dispute between Campbell White and his brothers in Baltimore over business dealings, which led his nephew William Pinkney Whyte to legally change the spelling of his name.</field>
