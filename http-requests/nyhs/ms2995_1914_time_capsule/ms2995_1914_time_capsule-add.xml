    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The time capsule included books, pamphlets, newspapers, medals, and a copy of a pre-Revolutionary War letter from 1774. A telegram from Governor Martin Glynn to his successor in 1974 was also enclosed, with a message expressing "hope and good will" that the challenges he faced would be solved by then. Other items include a portrait, lithograph, and related loose documents. All items in the time capsule have been very well preserved.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The term "time capsule" was first used at New York World's Fair in 1939, but the practice of preserving materials in a sealed box to help future generations understand the past dates back to at least 1876, when a proto-time capsule was introduced at the Philadelphia Exposition. In 1914, another early time capsule was created by a group of merchants called the Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association. It was launched on May 23, 1914 as a part of the tri-centennial celebrations of the New Netherland Company's chartering in 1614 and the beginnings of Dutch North American colonialism. The time capsule was placed in a richly ornamented bronze casket which was ceremoniously enclosed by a former mayor and entrusted to the New York Historical Society. The chest was to remain sealed until the year 1974, the bicentennial of New York's appeal for the colonies to form a union, but it was forgotten in a storage site until the late 1990s. Historians decided to wait until the 100th year anniversary to open it since they had already missed the intended date. Upon its opening on October 8th 2014, it was possibly the oldest unopened time capsule in the world.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">To keep the tradition alive, N-YHS created a new time capsule in 2014 with the help of local students, who selected items that reflect life in the early 21st century for the education of New Yorkers a hundred years in the future.</field>
