    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries includes correspondence other than that with authors of Quarterly articles (which is found above in subseries II.A). This correspondence primarily concerns the production aspects of the Quarterly, including design, printing, and publicity. Accordingly, the principal correspondents are vendors providing production services to N-YHS, including designer Klaus Gemming, Finn Typographers, and Meriden Gravure Company. There is some correspondence concerning Quarterly content, including solicitations for book reviewers and commentary from the Publications Committee. And there is some correspondence related to matters other than the Quarterly, such as with University Press of Virginia concerning distribution of N-YHS's publications. There is also continuing correspondence, primarily from the late 1960s and 1970s, transmitting inquiries and information relevant to a potential update to the Dictionary of Artists in America (see series I.A for similar correspondence from prior to 1966).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to correspondence, the subseries includes various work files related to editorial and administrative matters. Most of these files include edited submissions and galley proofs for the Quarterly's book reviews and for N-YHS's Annual Report. The work files also include notes on the Editorial Department's production expense budget from the mid-1960s to mid-1970s, along with the billings from its service providers for this period.</field>
