    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes two principal document types: correspondence from over ten years related to the production of the DAA and the note cards used during the research process to record information on artists, most of which were used for the entries in the DAA.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence includes the extensive exchanges between the Washington, D.C.-based George Groce and the New York-based editors Charles Baker and David Wallace (who was also co-credited with Groce as an author). The DAA and specific artist entries are the principal subjects of the letters, but other subjects also appear at times, including other articles and book reviews by Groce, exhibitions, comments on the work of William Sawitzky and others in the field, and the like. The files of Groce's correspondence also include the originals, copies, or typescripts of letters sent to Groce or N-YHS by other correspondents and DAA contributors in connection with Groce's inquiries. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence also includes files from a wide range of curators, editors, scholars, descendants of artists, and others providing information about artists for the DAA. Some correspondents also discuss their own interests or advance inquiries of tangential relevance to the DAA.  Principal correspondents include J. Earl Arrington, Rudolf Berliner, Wolfgang Born, Ralph Catterall, David C. Duniway, Edward H. Dwight, Elliot A.P. Evans, Sinclair Hamilton, John Davis Hatch, Jr., Bertha L. Heilbron, H. Maxson Holloway, Cliff Lord, Wilbur D. Peat, Francis W. Robinson, Anna Rutledge, Robert Taft, and Edna T. Whitley.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Finally, the correspondence includes exchanges between N-YHS and the publisher, Yale University Press, concerning arrangements for the production of the book and payment of royalties to N-YHS. These files include the original agreement with Yale concerning royalties and the records of royalties forwarded to N-YHS from 1959-1982.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes 19 boxes of note cards. All but one of these boxes appear to hold the original notes about artists developed by Groce and shipped to N-YHS. Several of the boxes are original and some have the shipping label on them. Paperclipped to many of the original note cards are added slips of paper with revisions, updated entry information, some correspondence, and other documents. Sixteen of the boxes relate to entries in the DAA and two boxes relate to artists that were "rejected" from inclusion. One box holds cards dating from shortly after the DAA's production and these record new information received in anticipation of a possible supplement to the DAA.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The sub-series also includes a small number of topical files related to publicity and requests for copies of the DAA and a copy of the DAA inscribed by Groce to Baker.</field>
