    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes the Editorial Department files concerning certain publications of the 1940s and into the  early 1960s. George C. Groce and David H. Wallace's Dictionary of Artists in America, published in 1957, is the best documented publication in the series. There is extensive correspondence between N-YHS editors Charles E. Baker and David Wallace and Groce, as well as with Yale University Press concerning production and royalty payments. The original cards used to record research notes and sources for the DAA entries are in the series. And the series also holds much correspondence and notes concerning information about artists provided after the DAA's publication in anticipation that a supplement to the DAA might be prepared. The series also includes a 2015 donation of documents from David Wallace that includes extracts from his diaries and other documents dating from his years working at N-YHS and with Groce on the DAA.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the DAA, the series includes correspondence related to articles for the Quarterly and various book-length works. Unfinished and unpublished projects are represented in the series as well as published works. Although much of the general correspondence files concern administrative matters, such as acquiring image reproduction permissions, many files touch on more substantive matters, such as the editorial and management decisions regarding whether or not to publish a piece and the sometimes fraught relationship between editor and author. William Sawitzky, Susan Clay Sawitzky, Paul Downing, Mary Bartlett Cowdrey, and Theodore Bolton are among the several correspondents represented in the general correspondence of the series.</field>
