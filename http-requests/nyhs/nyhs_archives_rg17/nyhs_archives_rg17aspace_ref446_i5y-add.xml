    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Publications, 1980-2000 series primarily includes documents related to the six annual conferences held at N-YHS from 1983 to 1988 on historical themes and the publications resulting from the first four of these. The series includes all original papers distributed to conference participants and presented there, and it includes documents related to the program planning and logistical arrangements for several of the conferences. The names of the presenters and the titles of their papers are noted in the container list below.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes various later versions of the papers as they were prepared for later publication in compilations based on the conference proceedings, as well as other papers not presented at the conferences but included in the publications. The series includes documents concerning the printing, publicity, and other matters related to the production of the conference volumes. The principal correspondence in the series is between N-YHS and William Pencak, the professor of history at Pennsylvania State University who organized the conference programs for N-YHS and who co-edited the subsequent volumes. </field>
