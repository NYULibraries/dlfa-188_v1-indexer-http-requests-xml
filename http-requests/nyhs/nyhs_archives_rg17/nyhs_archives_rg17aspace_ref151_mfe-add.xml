    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes documents created or compiled by David H. Wallace, Assistant Editor at N-YHS from September 1952 to December 1956. A major responsibility of Wallace's during his tenure at N-YHS concerned the New-York Historical Society's Dictionary of Artists in America, 1564-1860, which was published in 1957 and for which he was credited as co-author with George C. Groce. Wallace's papers include two transcripts he prepared in 2009 that include extracts from a diary he maintained and other documents from the 1950s. One of these transcripts recounts Wallace's day-day involvement with the DAA and the other provides a view of Wallace's overall activities at N-YHS, as well as his perspective as an N-YHS staff member in the early 1950s. The papers include a few letters, including those of 1952 from Director R.W.G. Vail leading to Wallace's employment, a 1953 letter from Louise Hall Tharp, and a 1958 letter from Wallace's successor as Assistant Editor. The subseries includes three photographs of N-YHS staff, including Charles Baker and Wallace, and publicity ephemera for the Bella Landauer collection, with a poem by Wallace.</field>
