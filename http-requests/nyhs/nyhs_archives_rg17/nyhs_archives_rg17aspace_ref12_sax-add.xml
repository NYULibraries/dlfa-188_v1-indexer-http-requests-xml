    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Correspondence subseries includes the files maintained principally during the tenure of N-YHS publications editor Charles E. Baker, from 1943 to 1963. Some of Baker's files appear to have been maintained for a time after his departure so the date range of the correspondence extends into the mid-1960s and, in the case of a file of copyright registrations, to the early 1980s. The correspondence concerns the editorial process for articles and book reviews for the Quarterly, as well as various book-length works. The material relates to works that were either published, unfinished and unpublished, or proposed but declined from the 1940s through the mid-1960s. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the files primarily include only administrative matters related to the editorial process, such as transmittal letters, photograph reproduction requests and permissions, arrangements for printing, requests for book reviewers, mailings of copies of the published work, and other such matters. Nevertheless, more substantive content can be found in several files; these include Baker's recommendations to the N-YHS Publications Committee regarding a proposed publication and the Committee's response and editorial comments to the author. Only a few files have manuscript drafts of the work and these are noted in the container list. A few files hold photographs and negatives; these are also noted in the container list.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among the more substantive topical files are those concerning Susan Clay Sawitzky's efforts through the late 1940s and into the early 1960s to continue the late William Sawitzky's publications on American artists; the unsuccessful Rockefeller Foundation-funded attempt to publish a book by Paul Downing on historic carriages; differences of historical interpretation with Eugene F. Kramer in connection with his proposed Quarterly article on the Harry Croswell case of 1802; and publication of Harold Edward Dickson's John Wesley Jarvis, American Painter. Among the many other correspondents with substantive content are Theodore Bolton, Irwin Cortelyou, Rita and Callman Gottesman, Fenwick Beekman, Mary Bartlett Cowdrey, Stuyvesant Fish, Lawrence H. Leder, Arthur Merritt, J.E. Strickland, Leonidas Westervelt, and George Zabriskie.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries does not include the principal editorial records for the Dictionary of Artists in America (see subseries I.B for those). However, this subseries does include a set of folders dating from after the DAA's publication that refer to corrections, updates and other matter related to a possible supplement. References to the DAA are also made at points in other correspondence in this subseries and these are identified in the container list notes.</field>
