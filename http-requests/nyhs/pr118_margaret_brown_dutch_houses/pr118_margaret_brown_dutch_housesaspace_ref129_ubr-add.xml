    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series II. Pre-Revolutionary Dutch Houses and Families in Northern New Jersey and Southern New York</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II consists of negatives and copy print photographs of Dutch houses located in New Jersey and southern New York taken by Margaret Brown for use in Rosalie Fellows Bailey's 1936 book of the same title, which continued Reynold's work. The negatives date from the late 1920s through 1936. The order of arrangement corresponds to the order of plates in the book; plate numbers have been listed at the beginning of each description. Variations of images in the book are filed with the appropriate plate number. The arrangement begins with a few photographs which correspond to the introduction to the book, then follow in geographic order under three categories: New York, Northern New Jersey, and Southern New Jersey. Thereunder photographs are arranged alphabetically by county and then the original owner's name. As in Series I, photographs that are variations of those published in the book are filed under the appropriate plate number; photographs with no corresponding plates are filed at the beginning of each county division.</field>
