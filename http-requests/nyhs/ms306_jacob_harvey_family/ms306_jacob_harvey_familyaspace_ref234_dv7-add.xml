    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries contains the correspondence and journal of Rebecca Harvey, daughter of Mary H. and Jacob Harvey, written between the years 1848 and 1869, in addition to a carte de visite depicting Rebecca Harvey. Letters from her family comprise a significant portion of the correspondence, and she received letters from her mother, Mary H. Harvey, her aunts and uncle Eliza, Sophia, and Nathaniel Hosack, as well as from Emily Hosack Rodgers and her daughter, Mary Hosack Biddle. There are a large number of letters from a Mary Isabel Rodgers, who may have been either the niece, or step-daughter, of Emily H. Rodgers. Rebecca Harvey also received letters from her relatives Mary C. Harvey and William Henry Harvey in Ireland. Correspondence, family and otherwise, is generally concerned with life and society in New York and in Ireland. Correspondents frequently reference one another, and their letters document significant events such as marriages, illnesses, and deaths, in addition to common social events, country retreats, and trips around the United States and Europe. Similarly, the journal of Rebecca Harvey is concerned with the manner in which she spends her days, her friends and acquaintances, what people wear, and social events.</field>
