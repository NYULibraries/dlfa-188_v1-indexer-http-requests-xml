    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries comprises Mary Hosack Harvey's correspondence between the years 1812 and 1871, including letters of condolence upon the death of Jacob Harvey, in addition to poetry written for her, and newspaper clippings and a scrapbook kept by her. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mary Hosack Harvey's correspondence is generally concerned with life and society in New York and in Ireland. Letters from her family comprise the most significant portion of her correspondence, the bulk of which were written after the death of her husband in 1848. She received letters from her siblings Alexander, Emily, and Nathaniel Hosack, her daughters Mary and Rebecca Harvey, and her niece Emily Rodgers. She also received letters from her relatives Hannah Harvey Todhunter and Mary C. Harvey in Ireland. Of particular interest are nine folders of letters from her brother-in-law in Ireland, William Henry Harvey, who was a prominent botanist of the era. These letters span nearly twenty years and chronicle significant family events such as marriages, illnesses, and deaths, as well as parts of W.H. Harvey's career. The container list further identifies subjects at the folder level. </field>
