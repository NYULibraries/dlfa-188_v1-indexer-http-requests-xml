    <field name="unitdate_teim">1808-1848</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries comprises Jacob Harvey's correspondence between the years 1808 and 1848, in addition to newspaper clippings and miscellaneous literary efforts, both collected and written by Harvey. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Jacob Harvey's correspondence covers a wide variety of subjects. Letters to and from his family, particularly his father, discuss commercial information, business conditions, local and national news, as well as English politics and Irish problems. Until roughly 1827, many of Harvey's letters are concerned with Quaker affairs in the United States, and the conflict between the the Orthodox Quakers of England, and the New Lights in New York. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In many of his letters Harvey examines the social, political, and literary scenes in the United States, and his correspondence is frequently engaged in a discussion of personal and public opinions on such subjects as the rights of Native Americans, the institution of slavery, universal suffrage, and democracy. Foreign affairs occupy much of Harvey's correspondence as well, and Irish immigration, especially in New York, comes under Harvey's scrutiny, as do the Maine and Oregon boundary disputes, and the Erie Canal.  
  
A number of notable correspondents appear in the subseries, including DeWitt Clinton, James Fenimore Cooper, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, John Randolph of Roanoke, William H. Seward, Martin van Buren, and Daniel Webster. The container list identifies all correspondents, along with notable subjects at the folder level. The subject notes are not comprehensive as they are based in large part upon the Feins's summaries found in the collection. </field>
