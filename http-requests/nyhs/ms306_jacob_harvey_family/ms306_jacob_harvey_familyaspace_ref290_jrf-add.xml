    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is a typescript associated with this journal that appears to have been copied from the Account of the Yearly Meeting in Philadelphia/Account of the Yearly Meeting in New York (2 of 2), which is assumed to be a copy — or final draft — of the journal described here. The typescript is an excerpt only, and does not represent this account in its entirety. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This journal provides an account of Quaker Yearly Meetings in Philadelphia and New York. Harvey records the daily operations of the meetings themselves, along with his observations of member conduct, and occasionally his personal opinion regarding the topics discussed.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In his account of the Yearly Meeting in Philadelphia, Harvey records nearly 2,000 members, in attendance from Baltimore, New York, and London, as well as from Rhode Island, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, and North Carolina. The meeting addresses such topics as the rights of Native Americans and the descendants of Africans, with special attention to donations that were to be made in support of these groups. Other topics include Quaker affairs, such as member anxiety regarding the blending of Societies, Quaker presence in the press and the perceived public opinion of the Society, and how members ought to behave during meetings and in daily life. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Harvey's account of the Yearly Meeting in New York records many of the same topics, but reveals a more morally stringent attitude specific to the New York Society. Harvey records a number of discussions regarding member conduct, especially on the topic of member association with non-Quakers. Elias Hicks emerges as a figure vehemently against the cultivation of relationships outside the immediate community, and here Harvey asserts his personal opinion in opposition to Hicks, as well as that on a number of other topics. </field>
