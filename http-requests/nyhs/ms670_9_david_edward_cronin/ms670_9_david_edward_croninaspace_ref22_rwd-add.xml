    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains mostly items related to Civil War cavalry units collected by Cronin, then inlaid and bound together as the "Cavalry Album." The pages were, at some point, disbound and foldered. The folder level arrangement of the album has been retained, though the original order of the items within the volume is unclear.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some material in the Cavalry Album is arranged alphabetically by soldier, and includes correspondence, reminiscences, addresses, military documents, and published items. See container list for names. Cronin's folder contains a portrait and military documents. Some post-war correspondence (both Union and Confederate) has been filed separately. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Further material relating to soldiers, mostly portraits, is arranged by cavalry. Units from New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are represented, as well as U.S. Cavalry. In addition, the Cavalry Album contains several portraits of army nurses, images of army camps, inventory reports, muster rolls, dispatches, orders, and newspaper clippings, especially those related to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also contains an incomplete draft manuscript of the "History of the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry."</field>
