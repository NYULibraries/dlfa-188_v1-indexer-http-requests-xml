    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs were collected by the donor Erica Guries's great grandfather, who worked on the High Bridge in 1928 when the stone arches were replaced by a steel arch. Images in the collection include distance shots of the High Bridge under construction, including some taken from High Bridge Tower; group shots of construction workers standing on and near the High Bridge; men at work on the High Bridge; and views of the Harlem River. One photograph has "Joe McCain" written on the verso. Most of the photographs (46) measure 5.75"x3.5", while one photograph measures 2.75"x4.5" and one measures 6"x4.25" and is affixed to a larger board.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The High Bridge, originally called the Aqueduct Bridge, first opened in 1848 as part of the Croton Aqueduct that brought drinking water from the Croton River in Westchester to New York City. It included sixteen stone arches, including five over the Harlem River, and connected the Bronx and Manhattan. A pedestrian walkway was added in 1864. In 1928, the five arches spanning the Harlem River were removed and replaced by one steel arch so larger boats could navigate the river. These photographs, collected by a man who worked on the steel arch, document this 1928 construction project.</field>
