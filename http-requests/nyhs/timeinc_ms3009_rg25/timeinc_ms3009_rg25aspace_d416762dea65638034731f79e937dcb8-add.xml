    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Public Relations Department Files contain materials created or collected by employees within the department between 1987 and 1991. Included in the series are clippings, transcripts, press releases, press kits, photographs, negatives, transparencies, pamphlets, reports, and correspondence.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The earliest records of the Fortune Public Relations department are from 1987 and show Gary Belis as the department head. While the documents themselves do not list his exact role, the Time Inc. department heads list shows Belis as the head of the Publicity department. There is no indication, within the records or in any department heads list, of this department existing before 1987 though it may have been a part of another department, such as Promotions. Looking within the files themselves does not clear up this issue either since the work of Public Relations and Promotions appears to overlap. In 1991, the department was renamed the Public Relations Department. Between 1987 and 1991, there does not appear to be a consistent name for the department. In general, materials within the collection indicate that employees used the names Publicity, Public Affairs, and Public Relations interchangeably.</field>
