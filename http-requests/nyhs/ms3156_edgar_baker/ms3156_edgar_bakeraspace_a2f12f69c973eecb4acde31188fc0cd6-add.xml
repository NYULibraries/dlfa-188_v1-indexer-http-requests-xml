    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series primarily includes photographs of Edgar Baker either alone (i.e., portraits, passport snapshots) or with others in business or business social settings. His wife, Alice Baker, appears in several of these either as she traveled with him or in the few personal photos here, specifically of the couple at their wedding reception. Most of the settings and other individuals are unidentified and undated, though there is one large set of photos taken at Baker's farewell party from Time-Life International. Two photographs--one of Adlai Stevenson and the other of Henry Luce--are inscribed by them to Baker.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to photographs, the series holds a scrapbook given Baker by his Time colleagues on the occasion of his 40th birthday in 1960; the object is richly emblematic of the office humor of the period. The series also holds Baker's passports, a "26 Julio" pin of the type associated with the Cuban Revolution, and a few other items of memorabilia, as noted in the container list.</field>
