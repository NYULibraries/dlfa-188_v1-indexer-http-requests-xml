    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Other Committee Minutes series includes the following three volumes:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The first volume holds minutes recorded by the Standing Committee and lists of early donations to N-YHS. The Standing Committee existed from 1805 until 1829 when the requirement for it was removed from the N-YHS Constitution and By-Laws. The volume does not include records from this entire period. Only four meetings of the Standing Committee are recorded; one of these (1807) was adjourned for lack of a quorum and the other three (1806, 1809, 1810) include only a small number of committee resolutions, one of which concerns the possible purchase of items from John Pintard. The bulk of the entries in the volume are lists of donations of books and other objects (1806 to 1818, with gaps, and 1822); these entries often, though not always, also indicate the donor.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The second volume holds minutes of the Mineralogical Committee, dating from 1818-1819. Although the committee was formed in October 1816 and existed until perhaps circa 1920 (the Society meeting minutes are silent on when the committee was discharged), this slender volume holds the brief minutes for only two meetings: December 28, 1818, and March 6, 1819. The minutes also include a letter from the committee's secretary indicating his unavailability for a March 26, 1819 meeting.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The third volume holds minutes of the Committee on Fine Arts, dating from its formation in March 1856 to March 1880. Although the committee existed until May 1895, there are no entries after March 1880. The minutes refer to the committee's support for collecting photographs, consideration of the Jarvis collection, the Audubon watercolors, the Bryan collection, the possibility of acquiring space for N-YHS in Central Park, and Mathew Brady's offer of photographs to N-YHS, among other matters. </field>
