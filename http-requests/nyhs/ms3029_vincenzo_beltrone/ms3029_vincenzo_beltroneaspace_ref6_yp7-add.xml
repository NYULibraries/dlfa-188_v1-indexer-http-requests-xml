    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III includes typescript and manuscript versions of virtually all Beltrone's poetry and some of his prose, in Italian and English. He was an active member of the Raven Poetry Circle of Greenwich Village, and some sheets show evidence of having been thumbtacked for display and sale at Raven shows on Washington Square. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">After her husband's death, Kate Fabian Beltrone worked to assemble an omnibus edition of his writing called Poetic Letters. This never materialized, apparently, but the projected volume was to include 293 poems—some drawn from his only known published book, Eroica and Other Poems (New York: S. F. Vanni, 1940)—grouped in the five sections below (which are detailed in a prospectus in box 5, folder 7):</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. Poetic Letters (36 poems)
2. This Pilgrimage (70 poems)
3. Appassionata (68 poems)
4. Selections from Eroica and Other Poems (29 poems)
5. General Poems (90 poems)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The drafts for a number of these sections survive in the current collection (see, for instance, box 5, folders 6-8), but Kate Fabian Beltrone reused binders, crossing out titles and inserting new ones (see, for instance, box 5, folder 10, where the title "Appassionata" has been replaced by "Variations on a Theme"), so it is unclear at what stage she left the project on her death in 1969. A few of her own poems and lyrics are found in box 6, folder 1. </field>
