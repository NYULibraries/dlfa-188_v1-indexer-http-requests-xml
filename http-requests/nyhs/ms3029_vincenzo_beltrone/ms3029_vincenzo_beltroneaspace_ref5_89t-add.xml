    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I consists largely of the correspondence exchanged between Beltrone and his fiancée (later wife), Kate Felicita Fabian (1903–1969), during his internment as an alien enemy of the United States, 1941–1945. Beltrone and Fabian each wrote often—sometimes more than once per day—to and from the locations of his internment. Their letters describe conditions in the camps, Beltrone's health, and attempts to clear his name. A number of the letters have been razored or redacted by government censors. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some correspondence is with Edward J. Ennis (1908–1990), director of the alien enemy control unit of the Department of Justice, and Howard F. Corcoran (1906–1989), U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A few letters are from Beltrone's fellow detainees on Ellis Island, congratulating him on his release. One, from a woman named Gloria McCleod (postmarked 19 June 1945), describes her attempted suicide: "I am sincerly sorry I had to let you see such an unpleasant sight as it must of been to see me jump from the balcony." Another frequent correspondent in the series is Raven Poetry Circle founder Francis Lambert McCrudden, whose letters are noted in the container list below.</field>
