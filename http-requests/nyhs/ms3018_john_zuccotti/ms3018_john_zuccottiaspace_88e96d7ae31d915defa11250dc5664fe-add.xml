The reference material includes  information concerning several of the incidents that spurred the creation of the Committee, especially the case of Eleanor Bumpurs. Correspondence includes three letters from Mayor Koch to John Zuccotti responding to the report. Some reports related to police matters dating from the 1990s that were found in Zuccotti's files are also included in the series.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In May 1985, New York City Mayor Edward Koch announced that he had formed an advisory committee to examine the management policies and practices of the city's Police Department. The review was prompted by a series of allegations of brutality and other misconduct by the police, often involving African-Americans as the victims. These included the killing of an elderly woman, Eleanor Bumpurs, during a confrontation with police.  The committee was to review the recruitment, hiring, medical and psychological testing, supervision, and promotion of officers, and to recommend changes. John Zuccotti, then an arbitrator respected by both management and labor, as well as someone broadly familiar with the city and city departments from his time on the Planning Commission and as Deputy Mayor, was named as Chairman of the advisory group. The nine member panel released its final report about 18 months later, in February 1987. It included about 50 recommendations including random drug testing, higher pay, the expansion of the Civilian Complaint Board to include other than police employees, longer probationary periods, and other measures.</field>
