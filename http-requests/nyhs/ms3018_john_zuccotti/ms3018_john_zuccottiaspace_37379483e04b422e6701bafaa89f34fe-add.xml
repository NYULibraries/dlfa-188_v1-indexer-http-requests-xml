    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes materials related to Zuccotti's appearances as a speaker on various occasions over the years. Perhaps the most coherent part of the series are the opening files, which include speeches, remarks and logistical briefing notes for Zuccotti's years in the 1970s on the City Planning Commission and as Deputy Mayor, and for a few occasions after the 1970s. Much of the series, however,  includes working files for the 1980s and forward, that is, files of rough outlines  and reference materials, often associated with multiple or unclear events. To the extent that some of this material was found together during processing, it was kept together, such as the file of material used in the 1980s to recall the New York City fiscal crisis of the 1970s. Most material though was found disorganized and was fashioned into rough chronologies or themes by the processing archivist. Detailed content of these working files is noted in the container list. The series also includes syllabuses, readings, some student work, and other material related to Zuccotti's work as an adjunct law professor at Yale in the mid-1980s and at Columbia in the 1990s.</field>
