    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes reports, correspondence, memos, proposals, working papers, notes, drafts, and print matter prepared by the Joint Center and/or  CVG staff. Much of the material concerns proposals for an urban development corporation (corporacion de desarrollo urbano) to handle managerial matters for the CVG, the nature of the local municipal government, and the legal research, analyses and draft legislation related to those. The print matter in the series includes the decree establishing the CVG, overviews of the project, and some newsletters and annual reports of the CVG. A substantial number of the documents are in Spanish. The container list provides specific highlights of particular documents in the files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) was founded in 1960 as an agency of the Venezuelan government. Its purpose was the large scale economic development of Venezuela's Guayana region, including the creation of a new city, Santo Tomé de Guayana (now known as Ciudad Guayana), which would serve as the area's industrial center. The region was rich in natural resources, including iron ore and gold, as well as energy sources, notably hydroelectric power, yet was sparsely settled and developed. With the creation of the CVG, a steel mill was started in 1960 and the Guri Dam was begun in 1963 on the Caroni River. A new municipal government was elected in December 1963.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1961, the CVG contracted with the Joint Center for Urban Studies of MIT and Harvard for technical advisory and consulting services in all phases of the city and region development work, including economic development, urban design, and public policy requirements. The Joint Center was created in 1959 as a research organization bringing together the academic staff of both MIT and Harvard to address urban issues. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Among the staff hired by the Joint Center to work in Venezuela on the CVG project was a new law school graduate, John Zuccotti. Zuccotti was hired to start in June 1963 with his work concluding in September 1964, with a possible extension to December 1964. Zuccotti worked with the team responsible for preparing an organizational framework for implementing the city's community service program. Specifically, Zuccotti assisted in preparing new by-laws for CVG and a charter for a subsidiary of the corporation to facilitate CVG's goals, drafting a preliminary charter for a housing foundation to administer the housing program, preparing a basic contract for "self-help" housing, and preparing legislation for the new municipal government. In his work with the CVG and Joint Center, Zuccotti was engaged with the core issues that he would be associated with for his rest of his career—land tenure, land use, housing, urban planning, and their connections to economic development.</field>
