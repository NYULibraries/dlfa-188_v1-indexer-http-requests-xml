    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection primarily includes several photographs related to Raymond Haynes's military service during World War I.  The photographs are of his training camp at Plattsburgh, New York, in 1916; a portrait photograph of Haynes in uniform; and of scenes from France in early 1919. The scenes from France are from the northeast and include images from Verdun, Spincourt, Etain, Longwy, and Jarny. Among the photographs from Jarny is one of the building in which Haynes was  billeted. Aside from these military photos, there are three tintypes likely from the late 19th century that include Haynes's mother.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to photographs, the collection holds Haynes's record of his bond sales for Redmond &amp; Co. from 1919-1921; two certificates recognizing Edith Haynes for her fundraising services during World War II; and two booklets. The container list provides more details on these.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Raymond Bontecou Haynes (1891?-circa 2000?) was originally from Emporia, Kansas. He attended school at Phillips Academy in Andover and then MIT, graduating in 1913 with a degree in civil engineering.  Haynes moved to New York where he became a bond salesman with Liggett, Hichborn. In 1916, he went into military training at Plattsburgh, New York, with the 6th Regiment, Company L, possibly of the New York National Guard Cavalry. He served in the military in France until 1919. After the war, Haynes returned to New York where he resumed working as a bond salesman for Redmond &amp; Co. at 33 Pine Street. In 1922, he married Edith Louise Williams (1890?-1978), a graduate of Smith College. Among other activities, later in life Edith was a member of the Board of Managers for the Presbyterian Home for Aged Women. Raymond and Edith would have two children, Elizabeth and Robert. Elizabeth would assist her father in the preparation of his memoirs, now at the Library of Congress.</field>
