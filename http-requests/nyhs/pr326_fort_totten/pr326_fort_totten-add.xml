    <field name="bioghist_teim">Fort Totten is a former active United States Army installation on a 136 acre site in Queens, NY.  The coastal defense fort was originally funded by Congress in 1857, and construction began in 1862 during the U.S. Civil War. It was first known as the Fort at Willet's Point (1857-1861) then as Camp Morgan (1861-1898) and finally as Fort Totten (1898-Present) named for Maj. Gen. Joseph G. Totten, Chief Engineer of the Army. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The 62nd Coast Artillery was stationed at Fort Totten in 1922, and in 1941it set up the first anti-aircraft radar installation on the east coast.  Fort Totten served as the headquarters for the anti-aircraft portion of the Eastern Defense Command during World War II, organizing anti-aircraft defenses for the entire east coast. In the Cold War era, Fort Totten served as the Headquarters for 1st Region NIKE missile defense system for New York and New England from 1954 to 1974.  Under a military downsizing plan, Congress approved the closing of Fort Totten in 1995, though the U.S. Army Reserve continues to maintain a presence there. Fort Totten was designated a New York City Historic District in 1999, preserving over 100 historic structures related to New York's role in U.S. military history and harbor defense.  In 2004, 49.5 acres of the area was turned over to the NYC Parks Department, and in 2005 Fort Totten Park opened to the public.</field>
