    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes correspondence inviting HRL to speak or submit an article for publication; his responses and internal memoranda discussing what actions he should take; planning and scheduling the trip to give the speech; invitations to meet individuals unrelated to the speech located in the area to be visited; background and biographical information on individuals and organizations inviting HRL, on those attending the event, those he may meet, and information on employees working in the Time Inc. regional offices; background on the venue and events where he is scheduled to speak; arrangements for where he will be staying, and detailed itineraries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition there are a large number of heavily marked early and later drafts of speeches and articles, as well as the final versions; handwritten notes; speech outlines; reference and research materials assembled to assist the writing process or to be incorporated into the article or speech; internal memoranda requesting the opinions of Time Inc. staff and their responses, comments and advice. The internal memoranda and correspondence involving logistical planning, fact checking, and advice given to HRL is sent to and received from his secretary, Corinne Thrasher, and a number of personal assistants and Time Inc. officers including Allen Grover, Russell Bourne, Emeline Nollen, C.D. Jackson, Albert L. Furth, Wes Bailey, Bernard Barnes, and John Jessup.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are also brochures, programs, promotional materials, press releases and other printed materials from the events where HRL made the speech or that were published by the group which invited him; and responses and reactions from attendees, Time Inc. staff and members of the public who read the speech or article. Some of the speeches were sent to prominent individuals and the files include responses from professors, clergy, deans, college presidents, businessmen, publishers and editors. In addition there are letters of gratitude; requests for copies of the speech; logistics dealing with publication and distribution of speeches; mailing lists for speech distribution; and reports of a selection of comments generated by a speech or article. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The contents of any one speech file tends to vary substantially with some containing very little materials compared to others. Of note in the subseries are drafts of speeches made by HRL in late 1940-early 1941 which became the basis for his "The American Century" article in LIFE.</field>
