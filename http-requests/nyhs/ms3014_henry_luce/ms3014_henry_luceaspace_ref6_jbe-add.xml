Luce (hereafter HRL) sent to his father, mother, jointly to his parents, sisters Elisabeth ("Beth"), Emmavail ("Vail") and to his brother Sheldon. In addition to the correspondence there are original poems, stories, sermons, doodles, stamps, as well as exams, essays, report cards and other school ephemera from his time in Chefoo, Hotchkiss, and Yale.
