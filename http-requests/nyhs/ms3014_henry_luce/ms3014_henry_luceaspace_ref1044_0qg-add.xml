    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries consists mostly of documents dealing with various aspects of Clare Boothe Luce's (hereafter CBL) finances encompassing her bank accounts, investments in securities, organizations, and the theatre, including the play "Arsenic and Old Lace"; payment of royalties received for her books, articles, and plays, including "The Women" and "Kiss the Boys Goodbye"; international publication rights; correspondence with financial advisors, brokers, managers, bank personnel, and Allen Grover; memoranda discussing her finances and giving advice; materials related to state and federal income taxes; insurance for real estate, jewelry and other valuables; annual meeting notices for investors; invoices; cancelled checks; audits, account summaries, monthly and quarterly financial statements, balance sheets, estimated expenses and income, proposed yearly budgets, and other financial reports.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition there are a large number of solicitation letters requesting CBL provide financial assistance for charitable causes, appear at fundraisers, and become a member of organizations. These also include follow-up letters, letters of acknowledgements, letters of gratitude, receipts, lists of charitable contributions made; membership cards, and a small number of photographs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are also notes, correspondence, and memoranda from Dorothea Philp and Isabel Hill, CBL's assistant and secretary, unrelated to her finances and which include telephone messages, letter drafts, itineraries, logistical memoranda, instructions, event updates, and arrangement for transportation. In addition there is a small amount of correspondence from HRL. Materials unrelated to CBL's finances are usually filed within the "Luce, Mrs. Henry R. (Clare)" file.</field>
