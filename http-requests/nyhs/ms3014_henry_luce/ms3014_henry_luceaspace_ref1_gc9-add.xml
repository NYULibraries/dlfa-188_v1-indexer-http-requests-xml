    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of files related to the life and legacy of Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL) and includes correspondence and memoranda regarding awards given to HRL; updated drafts of his biography; letters marking his retirement from Time Inc. and letters of condolences following his death; reel recordings of HRL's speeches, interviews and the memorial services; remembrances and anecdotes of HRL from his coworkers and friends; calendar pages with his daily schedules; copies of financial ledgers; handwritten notes taken from HRL's desk; and various commemorative projects following his death, including a postage stamp and an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The largest group of biographical files consists of HRL's trip files and includes internal correspondence and memoranda dealing with trip preparations; preliminary and final versions of itineraries and schedules; invitations to attend events while traveling and his responses; correspondence sent while traveling; letters of introduction; lists of individuals met while traveling and lists of individuals he expected to see, along with biographical information on them; and printed materials picked up while traveling, including guides, maps, and newspapers. There are also notes and reports giving HRL's impressions of the places visited, the political climate there, and his thoughts on the individuals met. Frequently these were sent to Time Inc. editors and officers for possible incorporation into articles. In addition, there are also notes and summaries from meetings with prominent individuals during his travels, including Charles de Gaulle and Clement Attlee.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Miscellaneous files contain mostly copies of correspondence and memoranda assembled by year that deal with a wide variety of topics including management of LIFE, HRL's potential run for the Senate, and lobbying efforts by the Century Group to provide Great Britain with old U.S. destroyers during World War II. There are also additional organizational and subject files attached to the series that are similar to other such files found throughout the series with correspondence, memoranda, and printed materials with or about organizations in which HRL was involved as a sponsor or beneficiary, served on a committee or council, and was a trustee or board member. In addition these files contain correspondence, memoranda, background and research materials pertaining to HRL's outside interests and activities including China and the rule of law.</field>
