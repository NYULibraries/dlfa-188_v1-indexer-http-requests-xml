    <field name="unitdate_teim">1931-1967</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of memoranda and correspondence which highlight the development and prominent episodes in the lives of Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL), Time Inc., and of its various publications. The documents illustrate HRL's thinking and beliefs, as well as his relationships and interactions with Time Inc. staff and individuals outside of the company. This material appears to have been assembled as part of the research for the corporate history of Time Inc: Time Inc: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1923-1941 (published in 1968); The World of Time Inc: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1941-1960 (published in 1973); and the beginning of The World of Time Inc: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1960-1980 (published in 1986). Many of the documents found in the series are quoted from, referenced to, or used for background information throughout these books.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The contents consist mainly of multiple carbon copies (some annotated), with a lesser number of originals and copies; some are labeled "confidential" and "strictly confidential." Most were written and sent out by HRL (some have "not sent" written at the top) to the entire staff of Time Inc., staff of individual magazines, to groups and to individual editors and officers as well as to individuals outside of Time Inc. The latter include Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, and to other individuals where HRL is responding to complaints, and explaining his thinking on such subjects as "The American Century."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Time Inc. staff members the memoranda are addressed to include MacLeish, Grover, Hobson, Wertenbaker, Billings, Larsen, Prentice, Jessup, Gottfried, Jackson, J. Davenport, Furth, Roy Alexander, Hedley Donovan, Thompson, Heiskell, Linel, and Paine. TIME, LIFE, FORTUNE, and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED are the main publications discussed in the memoranda. TIME International, LIFE International, LIFE Spanish, ARCHITECTURAL FORUM, and HOUSE &amp; GARDEN are sometimes, though infrequently mentioned.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records include early prospectus drafts for LIFE, THE MARCH OF TIME film series, and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, as well as periodical reformulations termed a "re-thinking" and a "respectus" which serve to update the original formula of the magazines. Memoranda covers a wide variety of subjects, including managerial appointments and personnel decisions; policy decisions, fundamental attitudes, convictions and responsibilities of Time Inc; responses to controversies in the pages of its publications; editorial and promotional strategy; and questions of budgeting, advertising, and circulation.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition, a large number of memoranda sent by HRL contains his general thought and ideas directed at his editors and officers for discussion purposes and consists of his comments on current events; gives ideas for possible TIME covers; elaborates on major themes and subjects that he would like to be covered by Time Inc. publications; gives editorial ideas; discusses articles he is working on; and positions he believes the publications should take. Frequently memoranda contain HRL's criticisms, evaluations, comments and suggestions on individual articles and entire issues of Time Inc. publications.</field>
