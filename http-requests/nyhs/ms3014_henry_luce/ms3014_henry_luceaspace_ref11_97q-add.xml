    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes the records of Allen Grover's activities managing the personal affairs of Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL), Clare Boothe Luce, and other members of the Luce family, as well as Grover's management of matters related to Time Inc. in his capacity as a senior member of the staff. These deal with personal finances, real estate, and artworks; and personnel, management, publications, and other Time Inc. related matters.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A large part of the series consists of correspondence and memoranda exchanged between Grover, HRL, and HRL's secretary, Corinne Thrasher. These include Grover's notifications of actions taken; description of actions needed to be taken; requests for approval; giving his impressions, advice, opinion, analysis, and recommendations; reporting on meetings attended and people met; making arrangements for trips, meetings, dinners, and other plans; apprising HRL of recent developments and giving personal and Time Inc. updates while HRL is traveling; requesting instructions; and detailing the results of investigations and research undertaken on HRL's behalf.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files include letters written on behalf of HRL and drafts of correspondence for HRL's signature; letters of acknowledgement; requisitions for expense reimbursement on behalf of HRL from Time Inc.;  background materials assembled by Grover; correspondence with other members of Time Inc. staff; and responses to letters of complaint. In addition there is original correspondence from third parties forwarded to Grover for answers on behalf of HRL, including invitations, requests for meetings, letters of appreciation, request for financial contributions and the use of HRL's name; original correspondence sent to Grover in his capacity as a senior Time Inc. staff member; and other correspondence and memoranda on which he was copied or that was forwarded to him for information. Some of the correspondence was sent by HRL while he was living in Rome. Some of the original memos originally written by Grover are in the files, having been returned to him with HRL's decisions and notes.</field>
