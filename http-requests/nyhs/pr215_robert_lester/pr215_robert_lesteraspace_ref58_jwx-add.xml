    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II consists of 244 35mm color slides, the majority of which are filed in vintage Filmdex slide files which are gathered into subject-based string-bound albums. Each album has an informal title page which has been briefly captioned in Lester's hand; albums are arranged alphabetically by title. One folder of Lester's loose slides of New York street scenes, signs, and theaters, is available at the end of the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"Art Shows" includes views of Greenwich Village art shows, mostly in Washington Square Park. The color slides show portrait artists at work, side-walk painting displays, and guitar toting musicians gathered with singers in the park. "Big Snow" depicts the city streets after the blizzard of December 1947. "Parks, etc." includes views of sun-drenched flowers, landscapes, ponds and birds in Central Park, The Bronx, and Fort Tryon Park near the Cloisters. Included are a series of photographs of children and adults launching large toy sailboats in Central Park. "United Nations Area" includes views showing the developing United Nations Headquarters site during and after construction between 1947 and 1954. "Waterfront" includes views of the Hudson River, the East River, the Queensboro and Brooklyn Bridges, the Midtown Skyport, seaplanes, tugs, ships, and docks.
