Clarke to Guy Emerson as a final report concerning the activites of the Advertising Bureau in connection with the Second Federal Reserve District's Liberty Loan Committee's marketing efforts for the Third Liberty Loan.

The rest of the volume includes a statistical summary of the Third Liberty Loan campaign; Clarke's general thoughts about the publicity and recommendations for the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign; a list of personnel in the Advertising Bureau; detailed reports from each of the Bureau's divisions (Space, Copy, Supply, Direct Advertising, Printing, Art, and Franked Cards), which form the bulk of the volume and include recommendations for the Fourth campaign; recommendations for the Fourth campaign submitted to Clarke by S.N. Shaw, the Assistant to the Advertising Manager; a report of the campaign's activities at the "Liberty Land" exhibition; and a complete list of publications and related quantities created for the Third campaign.
