    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Summary:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of materials in this series include reports and correspondence from private and government bodies concerning the West Side Improvement Plan and the proposed changes to Riverside Park. The materials include correspondence between Mrs. John Clapperton Kerr, and Marcus M. Marks, the President of the City of New York's Borough of Manhattan. Also included is correspondence between Mrs. John Clapperton Kerr and the City of New York's Department of Parks, Department of Docks and Ferries, State of the Senate in Albany, and the New York Central Railroad Company. Materials include general correspondence with NY organizations, lawyers, landscape architects, youth and educational organizations, and other individuals and organizations interested in the mission of the League. Among the documents is a report of the specific types of trees in the path of the proposed changes by the New York Central Railroad. There are also various documents concerning the Leagues establishment of the Park's Bird Sanctuary and Memorial Grove of States.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records are arranged alphabetically by correspondent. The alphabetic filing system is inconsistent in its method of arrangement. In 1929, the filing system shifted to grouping files together with similar subjects instead of in an alphabetical system. Therefore, records filed between 1929 and 1936 were assigned subjects titles that reflect the nature of the records.</field>
