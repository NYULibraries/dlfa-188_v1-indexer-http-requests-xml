    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains materials pertaining to Robert Ray Hamilton. The majority of the materials concern a scandal Hamilton was the victim of, between August and November 1889, when a woman named Evangeline (Eva) Mann falsely led him to believe he was the father of a baby, Beatrice, who she had reportedly purchased from a midwife. Only months after Hamilton secretly married her because of this claim, the truth of the situation was released publicly, resulting in family, friends and the public sending telegrams and writing letters to Hamilton expressing their sympathy for him, outrage at the situation and/or interest in adopting Beatrice. In addition to the correspondence regarding the scandal is the subpoena directing Hamilton to appear in court for Eva's trial, held in September 1889. This series also contains business correspondence regarding Hamilton's work as a lawyer and real estate agent, as well as bills resulting from his efforts to furnish the Republican Headquarters in New York City.</field>
