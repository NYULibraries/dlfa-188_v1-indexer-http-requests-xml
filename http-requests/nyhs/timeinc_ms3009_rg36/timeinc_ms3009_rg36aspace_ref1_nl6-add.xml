    <field name="bioghist_teim">The East Texas Pulp and Paper Company, often referred to as "Eastex," was incorporated in December 1952 by Time Inc. and the Houston Oil Company. Located in Evadale, Texas, the company was organized by Richard A. McDonald, under the guidance of Charles Stillman, with R. M. "Mike" Buckley being made Executive Vice President and General Manager. The original purpose of the company was to provide paper supplies for Time Inc. magazines, however, the unit ended up producing mainly pulp and paperboard. In 1956 the Houston Oil Company was liquidated with Time Inc. acquiring Houston's interest in Eastex.</field>
