    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Newstour Files contain records created by Time Public Affairs during the planning and realization of newstour trips. Papers and Books and Binders were not found together although both groups seem collated by Public Affairs or from Public Affairs files. The majority of photographic material documenting the newstours was separated by Time Public Affairs, and is in the series Public Affairs: Photographs and Negatives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records on the planning of the TIME Newstour '95 are in Donald Barr files in MS 3009-RG 5. Records on the planning of the CHINA 1999 newstour are in Special Events Manager Jean C. Gussenhoven Files in this record group.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to a history written up by Time Inc. in 1990 when considering reviving the newstour program, newstours were created by Time magazine in 1963 to give a small group of thirty to fifty American leaders the opportunity to visit areas of the world in the news and meet with local leaders. The newstours were arranged by Time Inc., funded by the participants, and encouraged by the U.S. government, though they played no role in the tours. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Participants were invited because of their expressed interest in world affairs and because they were known to be citizens seeking opportunities to contribute to global stability and world peace. The primary purpose was inquiry rather than commercial or economic information. Participants were heads of their fields in industry, education, community affairs, and other professions; each paid their own expenses and relied on the Time publisher's office and public affairs department with assistance from local Time news bureaus to arrange the program and meetings with international leaders in politics and culture. Newstour participants notably met with: John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Nikolai Khrushchev, Ferdinand Marcos, and Eisaku Sato.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Time also sponsored a 1973 visit for Japanese business executives to Detroit and a 1970 trip to Tehran for an economics conference. "Update on America" and "Report on America" were opportunities for foreign business executives to travel to the United States and meet with Time journalists, American business leaders, and government representatives. Newstours that traveled the United States were sometimes called "reverse newstours."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">For a history and background of newstours, please refer to "Newstour 1990" files in Books and Binders.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">More files from the 1995 newstours are in the Corporate Public Affairs record group. Corporate Public Affairs may have taken over the responsibilities for this event in later years.</field>
