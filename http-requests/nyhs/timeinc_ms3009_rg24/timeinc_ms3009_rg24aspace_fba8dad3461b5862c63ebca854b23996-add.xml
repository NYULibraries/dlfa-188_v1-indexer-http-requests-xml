    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Fisler's files span the period he was employed at Time through his transition to  Life. The majority of his office files are from Time. Although there are records from both of his roles the Circulation Department and the Advertising Promotion Department, his files were not separated as such, and this series is listed under his later position with Advertising Promotion. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Originally his files were loosely separated into a mixture of office files from Time and Life, speech files, personal files which contain both personal and business correspondence, and material from his aunt's company St. John Associates Inc.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to his files and the department head lists, Robert "Bob" Fisler was in the Corporate Circulation Department as an assistant to Time Promotion Writer William Baring-Gould prior to 1950. From 1950 to 1955 he was in Time Circulation as the Promotion Manager. From 1956 to 1961 he was in Time Advertising Promotion as the Promotion Manager, the top role in the department. By 1962, his title had changed to Promotion Director while still remaining the top role. One of his duties was writing the copy in the circulation promotion mailings.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> A letter in his 1959 Personal folder refers to him as the Sports Illustrated Promotion Director, and his records contain some Sports Illustrated materials. He may have briefly done side work for at this publication. In 1966 he moved to Life Promotion as the Promotion Director.</field>
