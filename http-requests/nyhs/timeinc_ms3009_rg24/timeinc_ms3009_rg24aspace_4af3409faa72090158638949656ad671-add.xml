    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Exhibition Files includes materials on exhibitions created by Time. Most of the exhibitions are shown at venues other than the Time &amp; Life Building. The earlier files are from business manager John Keller, his assistant Ann Bellows, public affairs director Robert Sweeney, or are unspecified. Later files are from Time promotion and special events staff Nancy Hall Megan. A note from Bellows to Megan in a Boris Artzybasheff folder indicates Megan took possession of the earlier non-Cover Art files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> The Time Cover Art Show files are primarily from Megan, quoted as "handling the cover show bookings for Time domestic," though files prior to 1967 are from Keller or Bellows. A note from Bellows to Megan indicates the tour files were kept by Megan although earlier files may have been created by Bellows. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> The Time Cover Art Show had several tour iterations grouped by year spans based on existing divider tabs. Iternations included subsets of tours so that each venue did not received the same collection of cover art. The title of the exhibition could change based on venue and the tours are rarely referred to by official titles. Repeated titles used include Cover Artists and Contemporary Portraiture from the Covers of Time. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> "Loans from" in the 1968-1970 tour include records on cover show items lent to other exhibitions or limited versions of the Time Cover Art Show which are not considered part of an official touring show. Cover art loan files from other years were included among the tour grouping at the time the loan occurred even if the loan was not related to the touring show.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Records in the Individual Shows sometimes state one is similar to another one or reference an exhibition in Chicago on the Ad Age, but it does not look like these are all part of the same organized tour.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Records include internal and external correspondence, catalogues, brochures, press releases, artwork inventories, photographs of exhibitions and related events, shipping invoices, and other related bills.</field>
