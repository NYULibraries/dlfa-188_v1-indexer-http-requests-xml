    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Time Promotion and Public Affairs document the organizing of special events and functions for both for Time Inc. and Time staff and events that included guests from outside of the company; organizing advertising competitions; photographs of internal and public events; and a decade of press releases. Special events include milestone anniversaries, exhibitions of art owned by the company, conferences, and newstours to other countries.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Time Promotion and Public Affairs seems to be the most robust public affairs department after Corporate Public Affairs. It handled several events that promoted Time Inc. as a company as well as a magazine, such as: coordinating travel and accommodations for Time Inc. staff and corporate guests when Time Inc. was a sponsor of the Olympics; organizing major annual conferences and symposiums like the Housing Industry Presidents' Conference; and overseeing projects and initiatives such as the Distinguished Speakers Program and the Time-Life Academy of Transition.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Up until 1967, there is no mention in the corporate structure of Time magazine of a public affairs department. Time did have a marketing department and an advertising promotion department since the earliest saved Department Heads List in the Time Inc. Reference Files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While Robert Sweeney is listed in the 1966 Department Heads List as an assistant to the Time publisher, he signs off as a member of Time Public Affairs in his 1966 files. It is possible public affairs was within the Publisher's Office even earlier, but not recorded as part of the structure.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beginning in 1967, Sweeney is officially listed as the Time public affairs director under Management along side of the publisher, general manager, and business manager. He continues to appear with this title through 1969. In 1969 the Advertising Promotion Department drops the word "Advertising" and becomes the Promotion Department. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1970, Sweeney moves over to the newly established Corporate Public Affairs, and no one is listed as part of Time Public Affairs. No magazine lists its own public affairs department, and it is possible public affairs services were centralized.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1972 public affairs reappears as Promotion/Public Affairs headed by director C. Lane Fortinberry who is also an assistant publisher, and Robert Ankerson as the director of public affairs. Former promotion staff are also part of this department. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By 1974, the department is called General Promotion, still headed by assistant publisher Fortinberry and listing some of the same staff. The department now oversees special events and an art director. By 1978 Sweeney takes over as the director of General Promotion and holds this title until 1982. Also by 1978 General Promotion has added a publicity director.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By August 1983 General Promotion and Public Affairs have split into separate offices. George Berger takes over as the director of General Promotion, and Sweeney is listed as the director of Public Affairs overseeing the public affairs manager, the publicity manager, and the special events manager. GP oversees the promotion manager, creative director, and art director.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By 1985 Berger is replaced by Katherine Erskine and the position of creative director disappears.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By the end of 1987, Promotion and Public Affairs are again one office with Daniel Brewster as Promotion &amp; Public Affairs Director. The office oversees the business planning manager, art director, public affairs manager, promotion manager, and special events manager.</field>
