    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contain administrative records from Time Business Managers William Hoeft, James Thomason, Kelso Sutton, and Lucy Werner; Assistant Business Managers John Howard and Ron Dronzek; along with Time staff personnel files created by this office. The records document financial decisions for the publication of the magazine.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The earliest records are ownership statements in the General Administrative Files. These forms were required by the Post Office to be filed annually by publishers of magazines. The statements list the publisher, editor-in-chief, managing editor, business manager, and major stockholders.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Office of the Business Manager was primarily responsible for the accounting, bookkeeping, and advertising pricing of each Time Inc. franchise. The Business Manager  reported to the General Manager, when present, who reported to the Publisher.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On the earliest paperwork retained from 1929 in the Ownership Statements files, W. W. Commons is listed as Assistant General Manager. Ownership statements from 1932 to 1940 list him as the Business Manager. In 1941 William Hoeft takes over through 1947. Eric Hodgins is listed as General Manager in 1942. In 1948 James Thomason becomes the Business Manager. Assistant Business Manager Kelso Sutton took over as Business Manager around 1962 or 1963 and remained in this role through 1968 when he moved on to become Time General Manager. According to the Department Head Lists in the Time Inc. Reference Files, John P. Keller holds the post of Business Manager for a year before Lucy Werner takes over by early 1970. She remains Business Manager through 1972 or 1973 and is no longer in the role by 1974. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The title of Assistant Business Manager is not listed in the 1970 Department Head List. The listing returns by 1972 and includes John Howard through 1974. There are no lists from 1975 to 1977, but on the January 1978 list, Howard is the Time Business Manager. Ron Dronzek appears on the January 1978 list as an Assistant Business Manager, but by November of that year he has been promoted to Business Manager.</field>
