    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I: Photographic Prints</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I consists of the images from approximately 500 assignments by Hewitt and Smith. The majority of the prints are credited to one photographer or the other with a stamp on the verso or the photographer's insignia in the print. The images are mostly silver bromide prints made on standard 8x10 inch commercial paper, and many are toned.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notes about the assignments made on original file folders accompany the prints and may include the location, decorator or designer, the date photographed, and subsequent dates that prints were made for various publications. Research indicates that the images did not always appear in the periodicals on the dates noted, suggesting that prints were commissioned or submitted but not necessarily published. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mattie Hewitt's photographs of New York City residences record both the "machine age" interiors of the first decades of the 20th century and the more classic, historicizing style that eventually eclipsed it. Sometimes referred to as "Forties Style," it originates in the work of several Paris decorators of the late 1930s and involves judicious use of Baroque, Rococo, and other period forms in modern settings. In the Hewitt photographs, the interiors of Elsie De Wolfe, A. A. Rateau, and Serge Roche best epitomize the style. Among Hewitt's more prestigious residential commissions are the homes of theatrical agent Elizabeth Marbury (De Wolfe) at 13 Sutton Place; Ann Morgan (De Wolfe) at 3 Sutton Place; decorator Rose Cumming (Cumming) at 54 East 55th Street; publisher Conde Nast (De Wolfe) at 1040 Park Avenue; banker and collector George Blumenthal (A. A. Rateau) at 50 East 7th Street; and actress Hope Hampton (De Wolfe) at 1145 Park Avenue. Also represented in the collection are furniture and rooms designed by Donald Deskey (Ypsilanti Reed Furniture Company); John Vassos (Studio of Margaret Bourke White); and architects George Howe and William Lescaze (home of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Dreyfus). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hewitt's commercial interiors are well represented. She photographed the numerous hotels, restaurants, and clubs including Ruby Foo Restaurant, Town &amp; Country Restaurant, the St. Regis Hotel, the Gramercy Park Hotel, and the Court House Club in Manhattan. A number of design exhibitions and displays from the twenties and thirties are also pictured, such as the Decorators Club 1928 Exhibition, the National Sculpture Exhibition, the Metal Products Exhibition, and the Old New York Exhibition. Hewitt's excursions into product photography range from the shiny fixtures made by International Nickel Co. to the exotic flowers raised by Hortus International. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While Hewitt was very a prolific garden and landscape photographer only a small fraction of the images in the collection represent this work. However, there are images of several estates outside the city as well as a handful of terrace and rooftop gardens in Manhattan. There are also some exterior views of particular buildings in New York City, sometimes in conjunction with interior shots.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Richard Averill Smith's work also includes both residential and commercial interior views. Well-known for his images of hotels and restaurants, Smith photographed Tavern on the Green, and Caf√© Arnold, Hotel Astor and the Vanderbilt Hotel. His domestic interiors from the 30s and 40s record homes and apartments in and around New York City and document a variety of tastes and styles of the era. There are a few assignment files, including Gimbel Brothers and the Waldorf Astoria, that contain work by both Hewitt and Smith.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The prints are arranged alphabetically by assignment title, which is usually the name of the business or resident of the home photographed. Addresses listed are those shown in the photographs, if known, and are in Manhattan unless otherwise stated. The number of prints varies from assignment to assignment.</field>
