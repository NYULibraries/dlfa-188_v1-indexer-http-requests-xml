    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes photographs of New York City buildings, storefronts and street views, primarily of Manhattan's Upper West Side. Also prominent in the series are over 60 photographs of the World Trade Center taken from various angles and distances over the years. The destruction of the Twin Towers in the attacks of 9/11 provides the chronological demarcation between this series and the next, and this series ends with two views of the burning towers taken from the 69th floor of the Chrysler Building. The series also holds several images of the East Village and SoHo areas of the 1980s-1990s, often emphasizing the graffiti and gritty feel of the areas before their gentrification in the early twentieth century. The specific scope of the series and the determination of which photos to include in it was made by the processing archivist.</field>
