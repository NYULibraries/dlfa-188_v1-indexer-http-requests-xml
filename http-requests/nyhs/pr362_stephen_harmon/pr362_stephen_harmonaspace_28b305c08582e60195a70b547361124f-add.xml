    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the photographs depict the sex-themed entertainment orientation of the area during that period. These scenes include movie theater marquees and entrances featuring "XXX" erotic films and street level storefront signage for peep shows, burlesque, video stores, and other adult entertainment. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs also include images of other businesses in the area, including bars and lounges, hot dog and pretzel carts,  retail storefronts, and restaurants, including Howard Johnson's and the Blarney Stone. The photographs are almost all of exteriors, with some interior lobby areas of movie theaters. Two photographs were taken inside the Colony Record Shop, which closed in 2012 after 64 years of business. Broader views of the area include large billboards and cars and traffic.</field>
