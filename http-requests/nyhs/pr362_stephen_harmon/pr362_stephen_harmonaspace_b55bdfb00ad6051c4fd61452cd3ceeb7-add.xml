    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Somewhat similar in scope to the Street Portraits series, this series includes images that center on people and the street life of New York City, beginning in the 1990s and extending into the twenty-first century. Unlike the earlier series, though, which tended to focus more tightly on "portraits" of individuals or couples/small groups, the "street show" series, to use a term Harmon often used in categorizing some of these images, tend to capture individuals in the context of some activity. These range from the quotodian, such as people waiting at a bus stop or children eating pizza, to the slapstick, such as a person slipping on ice, to the desperate, such as panhandling. Also unlike the content of Street Portraits, which was defined entirely by the photographer, this series includes both those images referred to as part of New York's "street show" by Harmon and similar images identified by the processing archivist. The container list descriptions were typically composed by the processing archivist in order to convey the literal content of the image; Harmon's email, preserved with the image, often includes his humorous captioning, his particular points of emphasis in the image, or other commentary.</field>
