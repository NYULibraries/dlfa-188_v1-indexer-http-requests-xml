    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection includes over 3200 color photographs, primarily in digital form, taken by photographer Stephen Harmon (1943-) of New York City's buildings from brownstones to skyscrapers, storefronts, parks, people, and street life in the 1970s-2017. Especially well-represented in the collection are images of Times Square of the 1970s, Manhattan's Upper West Side, Central Park, Greenwich Village, the New York subway transit system and the passengers who ride the city's trains, and the city's street life from quiet side streets to traffic and pedestrian congested avenues. Additional images will continue to be added to the collection.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes color photographs of New York City, primarily in digital format, taken by Stephen Harmon in the 1970s to 2017. (Many photographs in digital formats from this time period and later remain unprocessed, and will be added to the finding aid over time.) The photographs tend to center on either the built environment of the city or the people who interact with the city and its built environment on a daily basis, though there is overlap between these categories. A particularly good example of this overlap in the collection is the series of "subway life" photographs, which include images of New York City's subway trains, stations, and the passengers who use them, often as an essential element of their urban lives and livelihoods. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Harmon's earliest photographs date from the 1970s-1980s and include images of Times Square, the World Trade Center, and people and fashions of the time. The latest photographs date into the 2010s, and include the Santiago Calatrava-designed Oculus at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, the Gay Pride Parade of 2015, and many others. Ranging across these decades, and especially well-represented in the photographs, are images of Manhattan's Upper West Side, Central Park, and Greenwich Village, as well as many other areas of New York City. Manhattan predominates the collection, but Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx also appear.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Harmon transmitted the digital photographs, which comprise the bulk of the collection, via email over a period of 8 years, from his RCN webmail account to a New-York Historical Society Gmail account. The digital photographs are in JPG format, both born-digital and digitized by Harmon from original physical formats. Digital photographs were either attached to or embedded in his email messages and downloaded individually to local storage. Harmon's emails often included essential context for the digital photos that frequently went well beyond basic facts like date or building name to include backstory, commentary about the subject, humorous captioning, artistic intent and focus, and other deeper context. Accordingly, with only a few exceptions, the contextual emails were saved as PDFs and are included in the collection with the digital photographs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Stephen F. (Steve) Harmon is a now-retired attorney formerly of the Manhattan law firm Troutman Sanders and, most relevant for this collection, a lifelong photographer. Harmon was born in Brooklyn in 1943 and grew up in Queens. He graduated in 1964 with a B.A. from Queens College of the City University of New York and in 1967 with a LL.B from Brooklyn Law School. After residing for a time on Long Island, Harmon moved with his family back to New York City in 1978, living on the Upper West Side where he still resides with his wife, Cynthia. By the early 1980s, Harmon was a member of the SoHo Photo Gallery and exhibiting his work there and at other venues. His work is held by the Brooklyn Museum, Museum of the City of New York, New York Public Library, and other cultural and corporate collections in addition to the New-York Historical Society.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Gift of the photographer, Stephen Harmon, at various times, primarily beginning in 2012 and continuing. Harmon's earliest gift was a set of eight photographic prints donated in 1983.</field>
