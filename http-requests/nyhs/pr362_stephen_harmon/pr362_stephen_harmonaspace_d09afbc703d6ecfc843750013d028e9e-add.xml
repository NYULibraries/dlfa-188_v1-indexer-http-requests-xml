    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds photos of various areas of the city, primarily in Manhattan but also of Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Within Manhattan, areas that figure prominently include Central Park, the Upper West Side, 125th Street, Midtown, Greenwich Village, and Chinatown. The views are primarily exteriors of buildings, storefronts, parks, street views, and street traffic. These views range from close details, such as signage, shop displays, and doorways, to broad vistas of the skyline as seen down avenues, across the East River, or from bridges. Interior views of buildings are much less common in the series and their occurrence are typically noted in the container list. The specific scope of the series and the determination of which photos to include in it was made by the processing archivist.</field>
