    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Loose Ephemera is arranaged using the same basic organization system as Series I: Scrapbooks.  Most items in this series were once housed inside the scrapbooks, and were removed for preservation or exhibition reasons. Additional material has been added to these files since Landauer's death; it is no longer easy to know what ephemera items originated in Landauer's own collection. Some items have roman numerals written on the verso in pencil - these numbers correspond to Landauer's original scrapbook numbers and are written in her hand. Other material may have one of several stamps that Landauer used to identify her collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Within the general scrapbook-based subject organization, files have been further broken down by type of product, manufacturer, or geographical location where appropriate. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For ease of access, and to best utilize Landauer's filing system, all loose ephemera (i.e. not pasted in a scrapbook) not found in Series III-VII is housed in Series II. This series is organized into subseries by size.  Researchers are advised to consult all three subseries in search of their topics of interest.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries I: Small Ephemera (usually less than 9 x 12 inches) is housed upright in file boxes. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II: Medium Ephemera (between 9 x 12 inches and 14 x 18 inches) is housed flat in boxes. Some material in this subseries was originally pasted into scrapbooks. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries III: Large Ephemera is housed in flat files.  Most of this material had previously been called (by Landauer and N-YHS staff) "posters." </field>
