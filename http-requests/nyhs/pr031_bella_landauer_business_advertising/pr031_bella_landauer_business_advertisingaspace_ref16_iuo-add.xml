    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Once she moved her collection to the New-York Historical Society, Landauer had the Society's bindery create large scrapbooks for her, which she filled with small ephemera, organized by the kind of product being advertised. Within the scrapbooks, there is rarely any further refinement of organization; a researcher looking for a specific business or product may need to consult each of the 4 or 5 scrapbooks compiled on the subject in order to complete an exhaustive search. In some cases, Landauer's own lists (in PR 149) may be of use, but so much of the material has been moved around since Landauer's time that those lists may not be of more help than exhaustively searching.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the scrapbooks she compiled, filled with pasted and taped-in small paper ephemera, Landauer collected scrapbooks that had been compiled by others. These are of various sizes and subjects and are filed at the end of the series, with brief descriptions found in the box and folder list. Some additional scrapbooks of ephemera, acquired by the N-YHS after Landauer's death, have been added to this set.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The following is a list of subject headings, under which material is filed. Each topic may have several scrapbooks. </field>
