    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes files of cards by title summarizing the contract terms for that title. (The contracts themselves are not in the collection.) There are some variations in the pre-printed forms used, with one used until about 1920, then another used through the end of the date range. The earlier form has somewhat less data fields than the later form. Overall, though, the summaries allow for various data including basic description (e.g., number of words/length, format, date of publication, dates contract was sent and the signed copy received, etc.); compensation data (royalties and payment terms, advance information, price of publication, etc.); and rights information (name under copyright, serial rights ownership, publication plans, international (including Canadian) rights, media rights, use of illustrations, etc.). Although the pre-printed cards include these fields and others for granular detail, only those fields relevant to a contract are completed.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The cards are in three sets, with the first two similar in content, differing only in that they generally relate to different time periods. The bulk dates of the first are 1890s to 1930s and the second set are 1930s to 1970s, but there is overlap. The third set also summarizes contracts, but appears to be oriented more to royalties and other payments related to reprintings, with notes on actual payments.</field>
