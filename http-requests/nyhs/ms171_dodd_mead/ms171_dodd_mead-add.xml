    <field name="abstract_teim">The records of book publishers Dodd, Mead &amp; Company consist of the administrative, financial, publicity, and publication records of the organization, with some family photographs and biographical material. The collection is especially rich in author contract summaries, profit/loss calculations for individual titles, printing histories and inventories of titles, and book catalogues. Although books in the collection extend back to 1720 and through the 1800s, the bulk of the collection are business records and these date primarily from the 1890s and into the 1970s, with a few earlier and later.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Dodd, Mead &amp; Company collection consists of administrative records, financial records, publicity materials, and publication records. The administrative records include operating files such as board minutes, insurance policies, and salaries. The financial records include mostly stock books, financial reports, and analyses of profits, losses, and operating costs. Publicity materials include catalogues, brochures, and photographs of authors. Publication records consist mostly of copyright cards and other internal documentation related to the company's published works. These records expose the points of expansion within the company and reveal the reorganization and restructuring the company underwent as they evolved and technology progressed. The documents also include many family photographs and miscellaneous clippings and other documents that provide insight into the style and accomplishments of Dodd, Mead's leadership over time. There are also many books from the 19th century (and a few from the 18th century), mostly religious books Dodd, Mead published.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">This collection includes some of the records of Dodd, Mead &amp; Company. The company was founded in 1839 by Moses Woodruff Dodd and John S. Taylor as a publisher of mostly religiously focused texts, commentaries, and sermons. Over time the partners of the Dodd family shifted and the company was reorganized twice before becoming Dodd, Mead &amp; Company in 1876 under Frank Howard Dodd, Edward S. Mead (Dodd's cousin), and Bleeker Van Wagenen. The breadth of their publications also expanded to include contemporary fiction, how to books, encyclopedias (The International Encyclopedia Company was a subsidiary), poetry, historical nonfiction, and many international titles among others. In the 1920s-30s Dodd, Mead expanded, buying several smaller publishing companies. The company was bought as a subsidiary by Thomas Nelson Inc. in 1981, bought again by Gamut Publishing Company in 1986, and finally ceased operations in 1990.</field>
