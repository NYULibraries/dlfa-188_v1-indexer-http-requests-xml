    <field name="abstract_teim">A small collection of photographs documenting historic houses, bridges, trees, and natural features in then-rural Bronx and Upper Manhattan at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Many have been lost to time; some, like the Valentine-Varian and Dyckman Houses, survive as official New York City landmarks. The photographs were taken by lawyer and amateur historian Randall Comfort (1871-1959), who included many in his 1906 book "History of Bronx Borough, City of New York." The prints were likely made from Comfort's negatives by Beecher Ogden (1873-1963), a fellow photographer of New York City subjects.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Randall Comfort Photographs of Historic Sites in The Bronx and Upper Manhattan document notable residences, trees, bridges, and monuments between 1889 and 1911, a time when urban development was just beginning to reach the northern portions of New York City. While many of the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century houses Comfort photographed have since been lost (like the Lorillard Mansion in Bronx Park and the Century [or Nagle] House in Inwood), a handful survive, either as officially designated New York City landmarks (such as the Hadley House in Fieldston, The Bronx, and the Hamilton Grange in St. Nicholas Park, Manhattan), or by having been repurposed (like the Dennison-White Mansion, incorporated into a housing project at 745 Fox Street, Bronx). Comfort included many of these photographs or descriptions of their sites in his History of Bronx Borough, City of New York; Compiled for the North Side News . . . with Collaboration of Charles D. Steurer, A. D. Meyerhoff (New York: North Side News Press, 1906). Further descriptions appeared in the Historical Guide to the City of New York, compiled by Frank Bergen Kelley, second edition (New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1913), for which Comfort supplied the Bronx portion based on a 1906 excursion he mapped out for the City History Club of New York.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lawyer Randall Comfort (1871-1959) was an amateur historian and photographer whose focus was The Bronx. Over the course of his career he produced a number of papers and publications on New York City's northernmost borough, chief among them the History of Bronx Borough, City of New York; Compiled for the North Side News . . . with Collaboration of Charles D. Steurer, A. D. Meyerhoff (New York: North Side News Press, 1906). Many of the photographs in the present collection appear in this work. Comfort was also responsible for the Bronx portion of the Historical Guide to the City of New York, compiled by Frank Bergen Kelley, second edition (New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company, 1913), which incorporated and expanded on the 1906 excursion he planned for the City History Club of New York.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beecher Ogden (1873-1963), an associate of Comfort's, was a photographer who specialized in recording historic New York City views, which he sought to make publicly accessible by placing them in libraries and museums. His images can be found in the collections of the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, the Museum of the City of New York, and the New-York Historical Society. On April 22, 1956, a Daily News profile of Ogden, who was then 83, stated that he was "engaged on a special project of reproducing the famous Randall Comfort photos, which were made in connection with a history of the Bronx published in 1906." The backs of most of the photographs in the present collection carry Ogden's stamp along with an "RC" number ("RC" standing for Randall Comfort), suggesting the prints were made for this project, whatever it might have been.</field>
