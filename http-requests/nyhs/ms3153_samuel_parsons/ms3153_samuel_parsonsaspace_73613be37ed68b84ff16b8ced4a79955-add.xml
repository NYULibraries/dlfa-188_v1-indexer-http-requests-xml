    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Typescript of approximately 146 pages that is likely a manuscript of the book published by Mabel Parsons in 1924. It is missing the first two pages and an unknown number at the end (missing pages were not in the papers when they were donated to N-YHS). The subject matter primarily concerns Central Park and Parsons's memoirs of his involvement with the Park beginning about 1880 as Superintendent of Planting and later Superintendent of Parks. He describes his relationship with and favorable impressions of Calvert Vaux; his opinions of the various successful and unsuccessful attempts to add sculpture and other ornamentation and facilities to Central Park (e.g., racetrack, Metropolitan Museum of Art, zoo/menagerie, a bid for a World's Fair, etc.); observations and disagreements about landscaping and his efforts to improve the Park; the contributions of Mrs. Russell Sage, Andrew Green, and others to the Park; placement of the St. Gaudens statue of General Sherman; and the efforts to remove him from office. There is also a chapter on Morningside Park and on Parsons's observations of parks during a European tour.</field>
