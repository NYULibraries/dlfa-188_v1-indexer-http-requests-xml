    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1805-1908</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Correspondence, 1805-1908 series contains chronological files of communications directed to and from New-York Historical Society and its officers, ranging from its founding through the Fall 1908 relocation into its current building on Central Park West. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of correspondence is incoming, but some notes, responses, and copies of letters produced by New-York Historical Society appear (see also: Series II. Letterpress copybooks of outgoing correspondence, 1876-1911). Librarian William Kelby (1893-1898) frequently annotated letters in red pen, while his successor Robert Kelby (1898-1921) often wrote short notes or instructions on N-YHS responses to letters received. Internally produced correspondence includes memoranda such as excerpts of meeting minutes, acceptances of election to an N-YHS office and resignations, drafts and notes for deceased member memorials, presentation and resolution drafts, and informal reports on relevant legislation, commissions, funding, acquisitions, and other aspects and issues of operations. The recurring presence of N-YHS presidential and intra-officer correspondence commences with the tenure of Luther Bradish (1850-1863), and continues more predominantly with Frederic De Peyster (1864-1866; 1873-1882) and John A. King (1877-1900). Until president Samuel Verplanck Hoffman (1903-1912), the officials' correspondence tone and content remains relatively formal, chiefly concerned with facilities, fundraising, and meeting and committee logistics. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Five incomplete registers of correspondence dating between 1805 and 1847 open the series, chronologically listing select letters by date and corresponding parties. Beginning in 1876, N-YHS officers regularly maintained registers recording the senders of letters received, which may be used as guides to the files. The registers appear fairly accurate, but should not be regarded as comprehensive. Notes on the most frequent and/or notable correspondents -- excluding N-YHS officers at the time, whom are implied -- appear accompanying each register in the container list. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files are predominated by letters of acknowledgment or decline for N-YHS membership, committee, and officer election; reference inquiries and research requests; and proposals of materials for donation, sale, or transfer to the institution. The latter may be accompanied by sketches, inventories, and further description; these trace the trends, conditions, costs, and context of N-YHS collection development during this period. A small amount of the submitted materials themselves are present and noted. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence from the first twenty five years of the institution is minimal but by 1840 grows more comprehensive, prolific, and varied, with an increase in lecture proposals and arrangements, publications planning, research reports and funding requests, submissions for presentation before the Society, and general discussion of the services, operations, and activities of the institution. Library staff began to receive a growing number of reference inquiries (commonly relating to family genealogy and military, specifically Revolutionary War, history), space rental requests, and letters of introduction for researchers and potential members. The files also contain event and ticket requests (including election to special committees or delegations), personal information updates such as changes of address and deaths, dues payments and related membership inquiries, news clippings, bills for service, and corrections and commentary on N-YHS published material. These trends continue throughout the series. A select amount of personal correspondence with N-YHS officers appears, with Librarians George H. Moore (1849-1876), a scholar of the history of slavery in New England, and Robert Kelby often addressed on a more intimate and collegial basis.   </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The early to mid-19th-century correspondence files depict the institution as a sounding board for amateur and professional historians and genealogists, who share their investigations with N-YHS both formally and informally, solicited and unsolicited. Many other core correspondents are peers affiliated with related institutions, such as libraries and other historical societies, who often seek advice and material exchanges. The files represent a cross-section of prominent N-YHS members and officers (DeWitt Clinton, Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, Egbert Benson, Gouverneur Morris, Frederic De Peyster, James Beekman, and Hamilton Fish); historians (John Farmer, Jared Sparks, John Russell Bartlett, Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, George Bancroft, John Law, Frederick Kapp, Samuel Osgood); writers and lecturers (Lindley Murray, Horatio Gates Spaffords, Prosper Montgomery Wetmore, John Watts De Peyster, Pliny Miles); theologians (Samuel Miller, William Bentley); scientists (Henry R. Schoolcraft);  genealogists (Robert Dodge, Henry Cruger Van Schaack); printers and booksellers (Isaac Collins, John W. Taylor, Joel Munsell, John H. Hickcox); publishers (George Palmer Putnam, William Henry Appleton); and antiquarians (Samuel Gardner Drake). International repositories and individuals, many of whom are honorary N-YHS members, correspond from distant locations including China, France, Portugal, Brazil, and Denmark. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">By 1840, N-YHS began efforts to systematize its acquisition of materials, reaching out to state and federal government agencies and other repositories to seek publications and documentation. Around this time printed matter begins to appear and is thereafter interspersed throughout the files. These materials include membership certificates and dues receipts, meeting invitations, deeds of gift, formal acknowledgments of receipt and shipment notices from other repositories, and distribution materials or "circulars" produced by both New-York Historical Society and other institutions, such as the Smithsonian Institute, Maryland Historical Society, Mercantile Library, American Antiquarian Society, and American Philosophy Society. The Society's collecting habits also expand around mid-century to more substantially incorporate painting, sculpture, and other artworks, with the Correspondence files including documentation of these acquisitions and commissions. The Abbott Collection of Egyptian antiquities, acquired by N-YHS in 1860, also incites great interest and inquiry. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Over the next several decades, the field of librarianship further professionalizes and libraries, historical societies, government agencies, and other organizations, continue to proliferate and representatives regularly contact N-YHS for exchanges and other professional discourse, data collection, consultation, and collaboration. Colleagues in regular communication include A.R. Spofford, M.M. Bagg, F.D. Stone, Harriet Tenney, Lyman C. Draper, Charles Sprague Smith, Emma Toedteberg, Worthington C. Ford, John Shaw Billings, Isaac F. Wood, Melville Dewey, George C. McWhorter, Brantz Mayer, and other representatives from institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Columbia University, Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institute, Long Island Historical Society, New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, American Bible Society, American Museum of Natural History, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, United States Department of the Interior, New York State Historical Association, Wisconsin Historical Society, New York City History Club, Maryland Historical Society, the Lenox and Astor Libraries, and their successor, the New York Public Library. Founder of the Sons of the Revolution and former N-YHS librarian (1876-1878) John Austin Stevens is a regular correspondent during the tenures of George H. Moore and Robert Kelby.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Printed matter and circulars further increase as well, including press kits for travelling lecturers, auctions, and publications and business cards, postcards, and other advertisements, of which many highlight new developments in conservation, photography, and other technology. Solicitations for services, employment, research and organization funding, and real estate sales increase, particularly in the late 1880s as public awareness rises of the organization's attempts to raise money for a new building, and its subsequent purchase of land uptown.  Further materials relate to the N-YHS Publication Fund, including inquiries on purchase, transfer, order, withdrawal, and other shareholder matters. These materials begin appearing around 1885.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">By the 1890s, the files reflect the growing anxiety over N-YHS leadership and facilities, exclusionary policies, and conflicts over public access to the collections. The early 20th-century finds N-YHS staff preparing for the institution's centennial celebration while continually refusing acquisition offers in the face of funding demands for the continually stalled building construction and relocation; some Building Fund, Building Committee, and other fundraising related correspondence appears, including that of substantial donors the De Peyster family, Henry Dexter, and Mary Rhinelander King. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Prominent historians of the time regularly feature in the files dating from the mid-19th-century through the end of the series: Orasmus Holmes Marshall, Benson John Lossing, Martha J. Lamb, Evert Augustus Duyckinck, Anna Matilda Woodhull, Joseph W. Moulton, James Riker, George Washington Greene, Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan, J. Franklin Jameson, Reginald Pelham Bolton, Jane Meade Welch, Woodbury Lowery, Mary Stoughton Locke, and Mary V. Worstell. Other frequent and notable correspondents from this time period include writers and lecturers (William Cullen Bryant, Henry Steel Olcott, Henry B. Dawson, and Gherardi Davis ); politicians (William H. Seward, John V.L. Pruyn, Smith E. Lane, Asa Bird Gardiner, John Winthrop Chanler, John Bigelow, John Harper Trumbull, and Frederick C. Cook); educators (James C. Welling and John Howard Van Amringe); theologians (Charles Washington Baird, William Reed Huntington, and Horatio Gates Jones); artists (John G. Chapman, George Catlin, Louis Lang, and H.A. McArdle); architects (Edward Lippincott Tilton); scientists (Henry William Ravenel, John William Draper, and Samuel W. Francis);  genealogists (Joseph Jackson Howard and Morris P. Ferris); printers and booksellers (Charles Burr Todd, Robert Clarke, John F. Trow, Walter Aldrich, and U.P. James); publishers (G.P. Putnam, A.W. Elson); art dealers (Samuel Putnam Avery); antiquarians (James Carson Brevoort); and contractors of N-YHS (photographers Edward Bierstadt and George C. Dodd, art conservator H.A. Hammond Smith, and fundraiser Frank G. Tilford). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also documents the many lectures , special meetings, and memorial events hosted by N-YHS, containing print invitations, announcements, RSVPs, delegate and special committee election responses, and arrangements with special guests and speakers (including proposals and direct invitation responses, updates on research and presentation topics, accompaniments such as lantern slides, and subsequent publication of lectures). The files contain considerable amounts of ephemera relating to other institutions and events: tickets and invitations for important events such as the opening of Niagara Falls state reservation and the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, and circulars for Worlds Fairs and other expositions, often accompanying letters of recruitment for N-YHS participation. Late-19th century materials in particular portray N-YHS, its members and its brethren's advocacy, fundraising, and other participation in movements to commemorate important historical events, figures, and locales through monuments and celebrations.  Also included is a series of documentation relating to N-YHS's advocacy and petition to the state legislature to take firmer action in the preservation of public records, for which a Record Preservation Committee was formed. </field>
