    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Letterpress Copybooks series is comprised of five bound volumes containing copies of the New-York Historical Society's outgoing mail between the years of 1876 and 1913, chiefly written by the Librarian as well as other N-YHS officers; two additional volumes contain the correspondence of Magazine of American History editor and founder John Austin Stevens for the full year of 1878 and November-December of 1879. 
The letters are recorded in chronological order, with individual pages containing one to two letters. Registers in the front of the letter books offer accurate lists of recipients recorded alphabetically by last name, alongside the page numbers of relevant correspondence. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The general materials appear relatively comprehensive for the 1870s and 1880s, which also frequently feature formal correspondence directed between N-YHS officers, and the 1900s; copies of outgoing mail were less consistently maintained in other years. Series content commonly mirrors the General Correspondence files of Series III, consisting of answers to research, library operations, and membership inquiries; responses to acquisitions proposals and suggestions; acknowledgments of receipt of materials; arrangements for events and publications; and notifications of elections, appointments, resolutions, meetings, lectures, and other N-YHS committee activity. The Stevens copybooks concern various facets of magazine production such as contributor solicitation, research, and more.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notes for each volume identify frequent and/or notable correspondents, as applicable, and break down the page ranges by year for general correspondence copybooks, to provide researchers with a sense of scope for time periods of interest. The letter book registers may serve as a potential guide to  the General Correspondence files for researchers interested in specific correspondents, as they may suggest time frames in which people were in communication with N-YHS.</field>
