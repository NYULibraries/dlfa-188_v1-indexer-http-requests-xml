    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes records related to the restoration work on the church and rectory, including Preservation Youth Project (PYP) administrative records, correspondence and other documents regarding suppliers and other service providers, proposals, and the like. There are extensive records related to the funding for these projects, including grant proposals, budgets, financial reports, fundraising solicitations, and the like. Governance and administration of the St. Mark's Historic Landmark Fund is well documented with Fund trustee minutes, audit/financial reports, IRS Form 990s, investment account statements, and some detailed transactional accounting records. There are many photographs, including slides and albums, documenting the fire damage, Preservation Youth Project restoration efforts from the 1970s and forward, and events in the 1980s, such as the visit of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">This series includes records related to the late 20th century preservation of the St. Mark's church building and, after devastating fires, the restoration of the church and rectory into the early 21st century. Following is a sketch of this history as it relates to the content of the series:</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The series generally starts in the late 1960s with the formation of the Preservation Youth Project (PYP) in 1968, initially as a summer jobs program and then an after-school work program for neighborhood youth. The project initially completed the restoration of the east and west graveyards before turning in 1975 to a long-range restoration of the interior and exterior of the church building itself. The Friends of St. Mark's was organized to financially support PYP, which in 1975 became a full-time work training program to work on the major renovation project, overseen by artisans and master craftspeople. This project was almost complete when on July 27, 1978, a fire broke out in the church, causing massive damage.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Immediately after the fire, the Friends of St. Mark's re-organized as the Citizen's Committee to Save St. Mark's in order to raise funds towards the Church's restoration. The following year, in 1979, the structure for the receipt and disbursement of monies was formalized as the St. Mark's Historic Landmark Fund thanks to a seed gift from LuEsther T. Mertz. Nevertheless the Citizen's Committee name was in common use on solicitations until the work was eventually completed in the mid-1980s. With the work again done by members of the Preservation Youth Project, the church was rededicated in 1983 and the  work was fully completed in 1987.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Landmark Fund that was formed in 1979 had three goals: to restore the historic buildings and grounds of St. Mark's; to generate an endowment for its future care and preservation; and to strengthen the public use of St. Mark's by fostering its innovative arts and community projects. Not long after the completion of the church restoration, another fire ravaged the historic rectory in 1988. This building was a landmark, designed by architect Ernest Flagg in 1900. Again, the Landmark Fund and the PYP were engaged in the restoration. Work was completed on the exterior, but funding could not be obtained to restore the interior for its former use as a rectory.  In 1997, the Landmark Fund secured a commitment from the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust to fund the interior restoration provided that the Fund could develop an appropriate, mission-related and financially sustainable adaptive re-use for the building. This resulted in the formation of the Neighborhood Preservation Center (NPC), which opened in 1999. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The NPC provided office space for the Landmark Fund, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, and the Historic Districts Council, as well as offering public meeting spaces, temporary office space to community organizations, and research resources for preservation efforts. The NPC was managed by the Landmark Fund under a 20 year agreement with St. Mark's. With the expiration of that agreement in 2019, management of the former rectory reverted to St. Mark's and the Landmark Fund closed down, turning its records over to the church. The NPC continues to exist, now as a standalone 501(c)3 organization.</field>
