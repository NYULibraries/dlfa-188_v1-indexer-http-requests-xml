    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes office files and photographs primarily related to the Preservation Youth Project (PYP) from its earliest formation in the late 1960s through its restoration work into the 1990s. These files include grant proposals, work plans and budgets, fundraising efforts, and participant records. There are also publicity materials about the PYP and its work, as well as the major fires that led to continued restoration work by the PYP. Supplier and contractor estimates and proposals for various aspects of the churchyard and later church work are in these files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These files also hold various other photographs from the 1970s-2004, related both to some events at St. Mark's and the renovation of the rectory and re-opening as the Neighborhood Preservation Center, as well as some files related to the Landmark Fund's efforts, though these are principally in the following subseries.</field>
