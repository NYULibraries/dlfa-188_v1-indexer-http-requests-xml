    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I: Church Designs also Residence and College Buildings by Arthur B. Jennings, F.A.I.A.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I consists of three slightly different copies of a book manuscript with mounted photographs, postcards, correspondence and commentary by Edward A. Jennings about the buildings and career of Arthur B. Jennings. The three copies are nearly identical, but a few differences exist; volume two holds more original correspondence than the other volumes, and building coverage differs slightly in each of the volumes as noted in the box listing. The book was never published. A list of buildings depicted is available in the box listing under the first copy; only the differences from copy one have been noted under copies two and three. Three folders of duplicate prints from the volumes are available at the end of the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs are arranged in book manuscripts in their original order. They are listed here alphabetically by state, city and building name. The volume in box 1 includes a page index at the end of the volume. Dates indicate date of each building's erection, not the date the photograph was taken.</field>
