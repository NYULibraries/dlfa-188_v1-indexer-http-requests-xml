    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III. Manhattan Architecture and History consists primarily of unpublished book manuscripts with mounted photographs and clippings compiled and written by Dr. Edward A. Jennings on the history and architecture of Manhattanville, but also includes photographs and other materials relating to the Manhattan neighborhoods of Morningside Heights, Washington Heights, and the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The Manhattanville volumes were written by Dr. Jennings around 1940, incorporating research he did at the New York City Department of Records and his collection of historical photographs of the area straddling Manhattan Street (which was renamed West 125th Street in 1920). Included are descriptions of the history and landscape of the area along with depictions of local residences, including the Jennings family home, and such neighborhood institutions as Manhattan College, St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, the D.F. Tiemann &amp; Co. Color Works, the Dolly Varden Railroad Manhattanville Station, Knickerbocker Hospital, and St. Mary's Church. Copy photographs of lithographs, drawings, and maps are included in the volumes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The remaining materials in this series depict buildings in Morningside Heights, including Columbia University, in Washington Heights near Dr. Jennings' home at the time of his death at 2 Pinehurst Avenue, and a few buildings on the Upper West Side. Also included are notes for a slide lecture on the history of Harsenville and Bloomingdale, the current Upper West Side of Manhattan.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials are arranged by Manhattan neighborhood and thereunder alphabetically by subject.</field>
