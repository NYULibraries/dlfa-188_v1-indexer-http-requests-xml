    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV. consists one scrapbook including a few clippings, maps, and photographs relating to Short Hills and nearby Summit, New Jersey where the Jennings family lived on Highland Avenue between 1881 and 1886 in a house of Arthur B. Jennings' design. Jennings also designed many of the houses in this planned suburban area, including a few belonging to family members in Summit. Several photographs of the Jennings home with the family gathered on the porch are present, along with a simple street map and an obituary concerning the death of the suburb's founder and planner, Stewart Hartshorn. Two original A. B. Jennings sketches of Short Hills houses he designed are included with the folder of Short Hills residences. Loose photographs from the collection depicting architecture in Short Hills and Summit are included in folders following the scrapbook.</field>
