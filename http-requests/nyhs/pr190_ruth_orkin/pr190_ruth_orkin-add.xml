    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs in this collection are part of a series taken from the window of Orkin's fifteenth floor apartment at 65 Central Park West, between 66th and 67th Streets in Manhattan; most were published at her books "A World through my Window," and "More Pictures from my Window." They take as their focus Central Park, particularly the Sheep Meadow, and the bordering skylines of Central Park South and Fifth Avenue. The color photographs show the park and its surroundings in various dramatic light, weather, and seasonal conditions, from the Tavern on the Green decorated with Christmas lights in a night view, to a distant shot of sunbathers and roller skaters gathered in the meadow in the heat of a summer day. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the photographs in this collection were included in the exhibit "Manhattan Observed: Fourteen Photographers look at New York, 1972-1981," at the New-York Historical Society, from July 1981 through April 1982. The photographs, which were printed by G.W. Color Lab, New York, are signed, captioned, and in most cases dated by Orkin on both the front and the verso.</field>
