    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes prints dating from 1828 to 1840, that is, from the election of Andrew Jackson as U.S. President through the administration of Jackson's  successor, Martin Van Buren.  There are well over 250 prints in the series.  Most of the series relates to Jacksonian era politics, such as the dissolution of Jackson's "kitchen cabinet" over the Petticoat affair, his veto of the renewal of the Second Bank of the United States, imagery of Jackson's imperiousness, and Van Buren's proposal for an independent Treasury (known as a sub-treasury). The presidential campaigns during this period are extensively represented, and many of the prints refer to the Loco-Focos, a faction of the Democratic Party from 1835 into the 1840s. The nullification crisis and abolitionism appear in some prints, either as a principal theme or as a sub-theme. Although images of Jackson and Van Buren predominate, others include John Calhoun, Henry Clay, Winfield Scott, Thomas Hart Benton, William Marcy, and William Henry Harrison, among others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to politics, several prints in this series concern social satire and class-based depictions. The series opens in 1828 with an extensive number of the "Life in Philadelphia" caricatures, with racist imagery of emancipated African-Americans in social settings. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among the caricaturists that are particularly well-represented in the series are: H.R. Robinson, J. Childs, E.W. (Edward Williams) Clay, N. Sarony, A. Imbert, and Zek Downing.</field>
