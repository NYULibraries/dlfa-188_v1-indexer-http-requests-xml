    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1869-1899</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes prints dating from 1869 to 1899, that is, from the beginning of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant's administration to the close of the 19th century. There are about 530 prints in the series. About 270 of these, or about half the series, concern the Spanish-American War, with images from Puck, The Judge, The Bee, The Verdict, and other publications by Eugene Zimmerman, Victor Gillam, Grant E. Hamilton, Louis Dalrymple, Joseph Keppler, J.S. Pughe, Rose O'Neill Latham, Samuel Ehrhart, Horace Taylor, George Luks, MIRS, E. Noble, and others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes many prints from the "Darktown" series of the 1880s drawn by Thomas Worth, James Cameron, and others and published by Currier &amp; Ives. These prints presented racist images of African-Americans in various before-and-after scenes; "before" scenes included African-Americans engaging in some social, leisure or other such activity, with the resulting "after" scene one of ineptitude and mayhem.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As with the earlier series, presidential elections are represented here, especially that of 1872. The 1872 election prints include Ulysses Grant as a do-nothing president surrounded by corruption against Horace Greeley as na√Øve, inexperienced and a front for the return of the Confederacy. Some of these 1872 election prints include appeals to African-Americans to switch their allegiance from the Republican Party. The elections of 1876 (Hayes/Tilden), 1880 (Garfield/Hancock), 1884 (Cleveland/Blaine), 1888 and 1892 (Cleveland/Harrison), and 1896 (McKinley/Bryan) are all represented to at least some degree. The politician and former Civil War general Benjamin F. Butler makes many appearances in the prints.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Financial themes run throughout the series, including images of railroad barons, financial dealings (gold panic of '69), taxation, the  economic power of monopolists/industrialists, and  tariff reform in the 1880s-90s. Political corruption, especially in the form of Tammany, is a common theme. Social caricatures are also found in the series, including images of women asserting rights/new roles at expense of men/masculinity and  sets of "men on the street" caricatures of well-known political, religious, business and other figures.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Caricaturists not mentioned above but represented in the series include Thomas Nast, Frank Bellew, Vincent Brooks, Day &amp; Son, D.E. Cronin, and others.</field>
