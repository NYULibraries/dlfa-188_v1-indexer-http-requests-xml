    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes about 238 caricatures dating from the two decades (1841-1959) prior to the Civil War. Most of the caricatures relate to the Presidential election campaigns of 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856. Candidates featured include Henry Clay and James Polk (1844); Zachary Taylor, Lewis Cass, and Martin Van Buren (1848); Franklin Pierce and Winfield Scott (1852); and James Buchanan, John C. Fr√©mont, and Millard Fillmore (1856). In addition to the principals, the vice-president candidates and major politicians affiliated with the candidate's parties or positions appear in the caricatures. The aging Andrew Jackson appears frequently in the caricatures of the early 1840s in association with Martin Van Buren and the Democratic Party. Similarly, Martin ("Matty") Van Buren also appears frequently during this period either as a principal in a presidential election or in the background connecting him to the Democratic Party. Among other individuals appearing are John Tyler, John Calhoun, Horace Greeley, and P.T. Barnum.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The themes of the caricatures touch on the major national issues of the 1840s-1850s, primarily in the context of presidential campaigns and party platforms, though also as standalone images. Images concerning slavery and abolition are found throughout the series, especially in the context of the Texas annexation, the dispute over whether to admit Kansas as a free or slave state ("Bleeding Kansas"), the possible acquisition of Cuba, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and others. One image portrays the emergence of escapee Henry "Box" Brown from his box.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other themes represented with at least a few caricatures are the War with Mexico (1846), the Wilmot Proviso (1846), the Oregon Territory border dispute (1846), the California Gold Rush (1849), and the Panic of 1857. Social caricatures include those related to the increasing role of women outside the domestic sphere and the working class men known as "b'hoys."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among the caricaturists that are particularly well-represented in the series are: H.R. Robinson, J. Childs, E.W. (Edward Williams) Clay, James S. Baillie, H. Buoholzer (H. Bucholzer), Nathaniel Currier (beginning 1844), Sarony &amp; Major, F. &amp; S. Palmer, and John L. Magee.</field>
