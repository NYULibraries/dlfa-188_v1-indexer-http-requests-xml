    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes 375 bound and shelved volumes. Most of these are financial and transactional in nature ranging from the 1830s into the early 20th century, including captain's returns (cash collected by steamboat captains and turned over to the company agent), ledgers, cash books, journals, expense/revenue recapitulations, check books, outstanding (unpaid) bills, towing bills, bills of lading, and the like. There are several volumes of reports of passengers "landed and received," primarily from the 20th century. There are many volumes of letter books and letterpress copybooks. There are also various scrapbooks of clippings and of publicity material.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list includes an inventory of all volumes. However, when the inventory was taken, all volumes had been shrinkwrapped for off-site storage. Consequently, for the most part the inventory is not based on a review of the volume content but was based on any labeling visible on the spines, inventories taken at the time of donation, inferences, and other observations short of unwrapping all but a few of the volumes. Inaccuracies, especially in date ranges, are likely. The absence of a date range in the container list means that no dates were observed on the exterior of the shrinkwrapped volume.</field>
