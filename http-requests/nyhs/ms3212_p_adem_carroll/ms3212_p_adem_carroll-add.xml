    <field name="bioghist_teim">Paul Adem Carroll (often referred to as P. Adem Carroll) is a New York City-based Irish-American Muslim, who has performed extensive advocacy for other Muslims domestically and internationally. Carroll graduated from Fiorello LaGuardia High School in 1975, after which he attended Bard College. After graduating in 1979, Carroll joined the Peace Corps, living in Marrakesh, Morocco, between 1980 and 1982. After returning to the United States, Carroll received his Masters' degree in Near and Middle Eastern Studies from New York University in 1987. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Carroll's work has largely focused on human rights advocacy, largely through non-governmental organizations. In the 1990s, Carroll worked for both Amnesty International and the Church Avenue Merchants Block Association, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit through Americorps. In 2001, Carroll joined the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA) Relief, a Muslim grassroots organization that "seeks to alleviate human suffering by providing caring and compassionate service to victims of adversities and survivors of disasters." In his role as 9/11 Disaster Response Coordinator, Carroll provided emergency legal and financial assistance to over 800 detainees and their families in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Additionally, Carroll secured funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled his work to encompass so many detainees from across the United States. He left ICNA Relief in 2006. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 2003, Carroll founded the Muslim Consultative Network (MCN; today the Muslim Community Network), a nonprofit organization that provided community education and leadership development opportunities to Muslim and immigrant communities. As Executive Director, Carroll oversaw a series of programs to meet the needs of New York City's Muslim community, such as with the Nafis Salaam anti-smoking program.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Although he left MCN formally in 2010, Carroll continued to perform important advocacy work for immigrants, refugees, and Muslims worldwide in various forms. Between 2004 and 2015, Carroll produced the "War on Immigrants Report," a monthly program that investigated American immigration policy and its effect on immigrants. He also published editorials in various Muslim publications, such as Muslims Weekly, Weekly Mirror, The Tri-State Muslim, and Islamic Monthly. Since 2013, Carroll worked as the Director of the Burma Task Force, a non-profit that advocates in close collaboration with the United Nations for the rights of the Rohingya Muslims and the end to genocide in Myanmar. </field>
