    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection holds 28 scrapbooks compiled by the Hotel Association of New York City from 1916 to 1944, with gaps in coverage. 19 of these scrapbooks hold documents, primarily clippings, concerning the Association's activities; organizational matters; positions on state and city legislation, regulations and other public policy issues; and matters of relevance to New York's hotel industry. The other 9 scrapbooks include documents on particular topics relevant to the Hotel Association. Clippings from newspapers and trade journals and newsletters are the dominant format in the scrapbooks, yet there are also press releases and other publicity materials in them.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Beginning in 1915, the Association held a trade show, the National Hotel Exposition, in New York. These shows are particularly well-represented in the scrapbooks. References to specific exhibits and featured products, Women's Day events, the concurrent New York State Hotel Association convention, and other matters related to the trade show are found here. Other events held by the Association, such as golf tournaments, dinners, charity benefits, etc. are documented in the scrapbooks.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list inventory attempts to identify some of the more significant themes that appear in the scrapbooks of general subjects. These include the hotel industry's relationship with the 1924 Democratic National Convention, the 1939 World's Fair, the impact of World War I and World War II, enforcement of liquor prohibition laws, and others. Organizational administrative matters also are a subject of the scrapbooks, such as elections of officers. The New York Association's deep involvement in the administration and financial management of the American Hotel Association around 1924-25 can be seen in the scrapbooks.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">9 scrapbooks center on particular topics, including labor strikes (4 volumes), attempted criminal mob infiltration of union leadership (1937), a 1926 compilation of menus, the American Hotel Association trip to Europe in 1926, creation of a hotel engineering course at New York University (1923), and a volume of various hotel-related issues compiled for the Association by W. Johnson Quinn in 1925-28.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Hotel Association of New York City was founded in 1878 as an advocate for the city's hotel industry and as a resource for the professionalization of hotel management. In 1915, the Association inaugurated an annual trade show, the National Hotel Exposition (also referred to as the National Hotel Show); the exposition was held at Manhattan's Grand Central Palace throughout the period covered by this collection. In 1924, the Association established a Publicity and Press Bureau that generated press releases about the Association and hotel interests, and engaged clipping services to monitor the press for related articles; several of the scrapbooks in this collection are a product of the organization's publicity activities. The Hotel Association of New York City still exists and remains active.</field>
