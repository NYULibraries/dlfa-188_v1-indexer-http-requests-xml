    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries 1: Annual Reports of the LCU, 1859-2001</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The annual reports of the Ladies' Christian Union provide a thorough overview of the LCU's activities for the years 1859-2001. They include the treasurer's report, the names of subscribers and members, a report on the devotional work for the year, and the constitution and bylaws of the organization. Annual Reports after 1895 include reports from the Annual Meetings. The annual reports also provide dated descriptions of the buildings used for boarders. They often describe the layout, decorations, and repairs or modernizations made to the buildings, such as additions of electricity or steam heat. They also list forms of entertainment provided for the girls such as sewing machines and a library and, eventually, televisions, stereos, and computers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The annual reports also contain some general information on the boarders that the LCU served. They contain examples of the boarders' professions and their subjects of study and also include the number of girls who married or who suffered illnesses that year. Despite the fact that deaths were common, the Annual Reports from the nineteenth and early twentieth century focus on the healthfulness of their facilities. The Annual Reports also consistently reaffirm why affordable Christian housing is imperative to the young women of the age.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There were no annual reports created for 1999 and 2000.</field>
