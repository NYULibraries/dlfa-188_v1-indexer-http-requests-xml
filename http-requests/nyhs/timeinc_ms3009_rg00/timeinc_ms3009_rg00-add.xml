    <field name="abstract_teim">The Time Inc. Records document the history of the company from its incorporation in 1922 through the early twenty-first century. The record groups Subject Files, Bio Files, Reference Files, and Annex Files are collections assembled by the Time Inc. Archives that document the history of Time Inc., its departments, and its staff. Other record groups contain files directly from corporate offices and the offices of the editorial and publishing sides of the various publications and other departments at Time Inc. along with smaller collections assembled by the Time Inc. Archives and Library. Because departments frequently collaborated on projects and events or received the same updates via group memoranda or reports, records on the same topic may be found in several record groups or series. These records will generally reflect different viewpoints on the same topic. This Guide is an overview of the portion of the archive that is processed and open to researchers.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Time Inc. Records document the history of the company from its incorporation in 1922 through the early twenty-first century.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">HISTORY OF TIME INC.For a comprehensive history of Time Inc. and its founders, see the authorized histories of Time Inc. listed in the citations at the end.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Henry Robinson Luce and Briton Hadden met while classmates at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. They became friends while working on rival school publications. Both went on to Yale University and joined the Yale Daily News as freshmen. After graduation in 1920, Luce and Hadden went their separate ways. Luce traveled, briefly studied at Oxford, and worked at The Chicago Daily News. Hadden also traveled and worked at The New York World. Ultimately both ended up working at The Baltimore News in 1922.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">There they conceived of the magazine that became Time, with the working title Facts, before forming Time, Incorporated on November 28, 1922 in New York. They published the first issue on March 3, 1923 with a circulation of around 9,000. Luce and Hadden alternated as the president of the company, but shared the masthead as managing editors. Hadden died suddenly in 1929. Luce died in 1967.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Besides the flagship magazine, Time Inc. also launched Fortune, Life, Sports Illustrated, and People, along with the radio news program March of Time. Time Inc. created divisions for wider entertainment offerings such as Time-Life Books and the cable television channel Home Box Office, later known as HBO, and subsidiaries to handle the technical side of printing such as Printing Developments, Inc. Time Inc. also acquired companies such as publisher Little, Brown and Company, and lumber company Temple Industries; and publications such as Architectural Forum and the Washington Star. In 1990, Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications Inc. resulting in Time Warner. Time Inc., the magazine publishing branch, separated from Time Warner in 2014.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CORPORATE ARCHIVES.The earliest documentation regarding the establishment of the Time Inc. Archives dates from 1941, when a proposal was sent to one of the company's top executives, stating, "We are in favor of starting a confidential file of Archives, which can be kept up to date and which, as time goes on, should prove invaluable for...a comprehensive history of the company...Things we'd like to save:  original dummies, prospectuses, and first copies of all the magazines, complete sets of annual reports, complete and up to date material on H.R.L. and his writings, a complete set of all company bulletins, pictures, diaries and personal accounts of all early employees, etc...But there is at present, so far as I know, no systematic effort to keep track of all documents which have long range value to the company...Main thing I am anxious to establish is the habit of saving valuable material.  If you approve the project, we can start delving almost at once." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1950, after passing through the hands of several long time employees, the Archives Department was formally established, reporting up to the company's Central Services division.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">REASON FOR ESTABLISHING ARCHIVES.One of the guiding reasons for establishing the Archive was, as noted above, that as early as 1941, Time Inc. was considering a "comprehensive history of the company."  A memo in an Archives folder in the Reference Files, from April 1950, expresses the desire for a "definitive, scholarly history of Time Inc."  Three authorized histories have been published so far:</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Elson, Robert T. 1968. Time, Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1923-1941. New York: Atheneum.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Elson, Robert T., and Duncan Norton-Taylor. 1973. The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1941-1960. New York: Atheneum.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Prendergast, Curtis, and Geoffrey Colvin. 1986. The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise, 1960-1980. New York: Atheneum.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to Robert T. Elson, "Luce had a very strong sense of history, and a feeling that Time Inc. was a unique institution.  What he wanted was a record of the men and women who worked there."</field>
