      Cablegrams
    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Cablegrams A 813-A 2099 (boxes II.1-2) are cablegrams received by Harbord which primarily relate to personnel concerns. Earlier cablegrams mostly center around logistics (shipments, production, training, payments, replies to queries) while later cablegrams are mostly concerned with discharge, messages to soldiers, and verification of soldier status (location, health, condition, rank, citizenship).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These cables are organized topically by individual date and labeled with alphanumerical code, typically ranging 1-2 pages in length per topic group. Each cable is subgrouped into numbered paragraphs which represent separate messages. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each of these cables is signed by Kerr, McCain, or Harris; several messages from March, Marcorps, Baker; others include Williams, Garfield, Goethals, Keppel, Dockery, Pershing, Crowell, Biddle, Wheeler, Marks. The messages are addressed to "Pershing Amexforce" General Headquarters A.E.F.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A significant number of cablegrams are absent, noted only by alphanumeric code on otherwise blank sheets, noting that there were "no copies made." Most of these cablegrams refer to "casuals" or "casualties," though others are simply marked "confidential."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of cablegrams are seeking/relaying orders about personnel; procedure; release of and communication with prisoners; requests for money and/or goods; discharge of soldiers; aid for military families of fallen soldiers; notifications sent to soldiers while abroad (mostly related to death of family members); foreign infantrymen &amp; U.S. naturalization/citizenship (Mexican, Cuban, Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish; Panamanian, Danish, Russian, Colombian, Netherlands, Brazilian, Portuguese, Bulgarian); officers available to work different positions (veterinarian, ophthalmologist, flight surgeon); delays in mail; hospital organization; service award and rank
 announcements; requests for more officers; expense reports; machinery requests; shipments of Christmas presents; deaths from disease; epidemic in France; transportation authorization (including of military wives and children); funds transferred to Commanding General trust in Paris; prevention of disease spread upon reentry to U.S.; new system for baggage records (in response to lost baggage complaints); reassignments/moving of officers; statements to be read to soldiers; missing cabled money to soldier; verification
 of status of health and/or causes of death; Christmas greetings from Baker and March; service records; issues with notifying family of death/illness; uniform regulations; employment of soldiers; YMCA and other welfare organizations; suitable soldiers; special assignments for soldiers continuing military service (ex: American propaganda balloons); hiring of artists overseas for lack of camera coverage; "handling soldiers of enemy-alien birth."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Cablegrams with prefixes CA and CP (end of box II.2-II.3) include three alternate types of cablegrams different from the above type, though they still follow the chronological and alphanumeric code system. CA  and CP cablegrams are sent via courier rather than cable, and both sets are addressed to the Commander in Chief or Commanding General from the Adjutant General and copied to Harbord in his capacity as Chief of Staff to Pershing. The CP cablegrams are drafts to be reviewed and sent out. Most of the CP cablegrams are in letter-form with much more detailed explanation or requests. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The first folder in box II.3 is comprised of cablegrams from Pershing to Harbord. These are often denoted as "extract cablegrams" and are also in longer, letter-format. These cablegrams are primarily concerned with logistics about troops and supplies. There are also multiple requests for more men of specific positions and at least one request for women stenographers, typists, and clerks.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The last three folders in box 3 are comprised of cablegrams received and sent about urgent need either for supplies or conditions of living (primarily in prison or aboard ships). Urgent supply needs include medical, artillery, clothing, uniform, beds, horses, lithographs, and cameras among other materials. Most of the messages are complaints or concerns about morale and/or health risks, but most of these claims are decided to be unfounded.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">SOS (Services of Supply) cablegrams in boxes II.4-II.5 are sent and received directly by Harbord, addressed and signed by him and the Adjutant General. These are primarily concerned with logistics of supplies, specifically artillery, machine, animals.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">
      Reports
    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Reports and memorandums were generally authored by Harbord and cover a variety of military topics as indicated by the titles in the Box and Folder list.</field>
