    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series primarily includes records concerning the various legal matters handled by W. Stebbins Smith. The series has not been processed and so this description is based on a quick survey of the content of each box. Perhaps half of the series remains in its original condition of tri-folded documents tied together in bundles, often several inches in depth. The rest of the documents are loose and so their relationship, if any, to surrounding documents is unclear.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Overall, the legal matters appear to center, perhaps exclusively so, on real estate property transactions and general estate matters (i.e., administration of wills). These appear to principally concern Bronx communities such as Morrisania, Melrose, Olinville, Highbridgeville, West Farms, and Wakefield, and others not noted. Property in areas outside the Bronx, such as White Plains, are also represented in the series. Transactions include purchases, sales, and leases of property, as well as claims related to property ownership, such as tax liens, assessments for improvements, damage claims against or on behalf of owners, and the like. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Generally, it appears that Smith represented individuals, not corporate/institutional interests. One major exception to this is that he seems to have often represented local Methodist Episcopal churches, including the Centreville African Methodist Episcopal Church, in their real estate matters, as reflected in the series. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Documents in the series include title abstracts, deeds, insurance policies, contracts/agreements, wills, mortgages, assessments, damage claims, property maps, tax bills, and other real estate transaction-related documents. Print matter is found throughout, such as newspaper clippings of real estate auctions and other related matters, auction broadsides, tax lien and other property-related lists, etc. There is extensive, though scattered, correspondence. Much of this relates to legal matters, but much also relates to other matters as reflected in the correspondence of Series I. Some of this appears to have formerly been in letterboxes such as those represented in Series I, while other letters are loose.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of the documents, dating from the 1880s-1930s, relate to the activities of W. Stebbins Smith. The series also includes many documents from the 1840s-1870s that relate to Smith's father, Chauncey Smith, who was also a lawyer. There is some overlap in the 1870s and perhaps in the early 1880s as the father and son partnered for a brief time. Some documents relate to Smith's handling of Chauncey's estate. It is also likely that some of the early documents do not relate to Chauncey's activities, but were compiled by W. Stebbins Smith as part of his file on matters of a later date.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the container list, the phrase "Holds typical mix of tri-folded bundles and loose documents on various matters" is used to indicate that the above-described broad mix of documents is present in the box. In some instances, particular document types or legal matters could be readily discerned on a quick survey and those were also noted in the container list, but should not be taken as encompassing a box's entire content. None of the tri-folded bundles were unbound during the survey so the survey could only perceive the content based on the description from the outermost document (which was often the title abstract with the name of the matter). Date ranges are rough and based on the (relatively few) viewed documents. </field>
