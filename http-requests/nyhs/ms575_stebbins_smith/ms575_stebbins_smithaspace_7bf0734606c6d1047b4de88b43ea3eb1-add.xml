    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1899-1935</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series holds the content of about 52 letterboxes in the collection, dating from about 1899 to about 1935. The boxes had deteriorated so the contents were removed into archival folders and rehoused in October 2021, but the arrangement of the folders retained that of the letterboxes. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series primarily includes incoming letters, and also holds drafts or copies of outgoing letters and various forms of print matter and ephemera (e.g., newspaper clippings, advertisements, pamphlets, political handbills, programs, business cards, solicitations for donations, etc.).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence was only skimmed for subject matter content by the archivist. It appears that there is some correspondence here related to Smith's clients/legal matters, but these seem to be mostly of a transactional nature (e.g., arrangements for title searches, inquiries about potential matters, etc.); more client-related correspondence is likely found with the legal files in Series III.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">More extensive here is Smith's correspondence on personal affairs and on matters that lie on the blurry boundary between personal and professional interests. These include documents related to elections and politics (filed under "P") and to Smith's apparent support for the Republican Club of the City of New York (under "R"). A consistently sizable amount of material over the years is found filed under "C" for various churches, most especially those of the Methodist Episcopal denomination in the Bronx and New York City generally, and for various Christian charitable causes, such as the YMCA. Under "T" can be found extensive material from the North Side Board of Trade in the City of New York (renamed in 1914 as the Bronx Board of Trade in the City of New York). While some of this material is of a general solicitation nature, some is specific to Smith and reflects his deeper support of some of these institutions and activities.</field>
