    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection includes the papers of Bronx, New York-based lawyer, W. Stebbins Smith, who practiced from the 1870s to the early 1930s. To a much lesser extent, the collection also includes the papers of Smith's father, Chauncey Smith, who was also a lawyer practicing from perhaps the 1840s to the 1880s. Smith's practice primarily encompassed real estate and general estate matters in the Bronx and Westchester County, and the collection reflects that. In addition to the many individuals represented by Smith, the collection includes records related to the real estate transactions of various Methodist Episcopal churches which engaged Smith. As a member of the Bronx community himself, Smith's papers also include a sizable amount of correspondence and other documents related to local politics, trade, transit, and charitable causes. The legal papers have not been processed and access restrictions apply to them.</field>

Centered principally on the Bronx real estate market, the collection includes title abstracts, maps, deeds, mortgages, lease and other agreements, tax and other assessments, damage claims, client-related correspondence, etc. There is print matter related to auctions, tax liens, foreclosure sales, and the like.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">W. (William) Stebbins Smith was born about 1846. He attended Columbia Law School, graduating in the 1870s. By 1881, he had joined his father, Chauncey Smith, who was also a lawyer, in practice in the Bronx, New York. Smith's practice seems to have centered principally on real estate property transactions and general estate administration. He lived in the Bronx and practiced law there for about 65 years, retiring in the mid-1930s. He seems to have worked out of the same office at 462 East 167th Street for most, and perhaps all, of his career (though the city changed the building number at least once during his ownership). Smith was active in various civic, professional, and religious organizations. As one example, he served a two-year term in 1903-04 as the first president of the Bronx County Bar Association. Smith died in Kingston, NY, in 1937 at age 91.</field>
