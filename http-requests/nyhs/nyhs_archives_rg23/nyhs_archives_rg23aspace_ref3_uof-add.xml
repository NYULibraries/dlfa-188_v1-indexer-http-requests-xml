    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Program Files series includes records related to the creation, publicity, outreach, funding, and implementation of N-YHS's public programs, principally for the years 1984-1992. Regular programming included, among other things, panel discussions, lectures, concerts, films, and gallery tours. The programs also included school age education programs, such as tours for schoolchildren and teacher/educator workshops, as well as special collaborations such as arts-in-education classes or programs for at-risk students. See the Historical Note above for further description of some of the specific programs well-represented in the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series appears to be, in general, a compilation of records from at least seven individuals: Directors of Public Programs Carole Slatkin (1984-1989) and Rae Alexander-Minter (1989-1993), Associates for Public Programs Stephanie Starr (until about 1989) and Erika Sanger (about 1989-1993), Associate for School Programs Judith M. Giuriceo (started about 1990), and docent/volunteer coordinators Jane Lattes (until about 1989) and Marion Galison (1989-1993). The series includes program descriptions, planning documents, correspondence and memos, publicity, attendance counts, logistical records (e.g., group reservation forms, docent schedules), program evaluations, curriculum or presentation materials for school groups, background texts and some training or informational content for docents. The specific programs covered are wide-ranging and further detail on scope and content at the box level is given below in the container list.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although the bulk of the series includes documents from 1984-1992, there is a small amount of earlier program material, principally publicity-related; this is noted in the container list. For later periods, there are also publicity brochures from the early 2000s.</field>
