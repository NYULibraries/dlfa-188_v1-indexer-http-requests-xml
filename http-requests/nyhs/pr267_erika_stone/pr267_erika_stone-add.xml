    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Erika Stone Photograph Collection spans the period from the 1940s to the 1990s and primarily contains images of life in New York City. The collection, containing forty-four gelatin silver prints, is divided into the following subjects:</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born in Germany in 1924, Erika Stone came to New York in 1936 at age 12. She joined the Photo League in 1940 and, by the age of 17, she created the Bowery series, one of her first bodies of work. While she considers herself self-taught, Stone studied with Berenice Abbott and George Tice at the New School for Social Research.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Stone spent part of her career as a freelance photojournalist as well as being a stringer for both Time and Der Spiegel magazines, until 1960. After the birth of her two sons, she made photographing her family and children her specialty. She has published several books, including: Pro Techniques of Photographing Children and Mostly People: Photographs by a German Immigrant in New York.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Forty photographs were donated by Erika Stone and four photographs were purchased by the New-York Historical Society in 2007.</field>
