    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Ephemera Collection (formerly referred to as the Ephemera File) spans the period from approximately mid-19th century to the present, and contains a variety of printed ephemera, including advertisements, flyers, calendars, event announcements and programs, greeting cards, and other disposable or everyday items.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is divided into 5 series. Series I, Ephemera, includes material relating to products (food, clothing, household items, etc.); establishments such as hotels and restaurants, charitable and other organizations; and cultural and political events, primarily in New York City. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II, Prohibition-related ephemera, includes speakeasy cards (advertising illicit bars that operated during the years of Prohibition), cartoons and caricatures, and other Prohibition and temperance related ephemera. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III, Advertising postcards, includes 510 postcards from the 1990s, which would have been found in bars, clubs, restaurants and other venues. The majority of these cards advertise New York businesses.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV, Ephemera albums, consists of two albums of pasted-in ephemera, including scraps and diecuts, advertisements and trade cards.  Notable items include images promoting racial and ethnic stereotypes and images of Santa Claus.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series V, Erotic advertising cards, includes loose paper cards advertising phone sex hotlines, adult establishments and the like. This material is extremely graphic.  Most of these were donated by photographer Andreas Feininger.  N-YHS staff collected several others during the late 1980s and early 1990s.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The Ephemera Collection was compiled by New-York Historical Society from various sources. 510 advertising postcards were donated by Bert Hansen in 2000.  Erotic advertising cards were donated by photographer Andreas Feininger in the 1990's, and the Schreyer family in the early 2000's.  The remaining items were acquired through staff or individual donations.  It is anticipated that items will continue to be added.</field>
