    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes an autograph collection, souvenirs of social and cultural events, calling cards received at home while the Foxes lived in Washington, drawings, photographs, and the illustrated manuscript of a satirical account of life aboard a steam battleship. The autographed letters include some addressed to President Andrew Jackson and then referred to the Secretary of the Navy, and show signatures of author Washington Irving, President Martin Van Buren, and politicians Robert Livingston and Thurlow Weed. The invitations include those to Lincoln's second inauguration in March, 1865; dinners with visiting Russian officers; and a ceremony marking the raising of the American flag over Fort Sumter after its recapture in 1865. Among the undated cards announcing an "at home" is one for the White House from President and Mrs. Lincoln.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The drawings include some by Admiral David Porter, who is probably the author and illustrator of the satirical volume. The photographs include one of a woman, perhaps Virginia Woodbury Fox, alone, and with members of her family; as well as an unidentified older African-American woman.</field>
