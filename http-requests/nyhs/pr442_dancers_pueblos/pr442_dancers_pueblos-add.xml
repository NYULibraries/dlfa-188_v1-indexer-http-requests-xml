    <field name="bioghist_teim">David Michael Kennedy is a professional photographer now living in El Rito, New Mexico. From 1972-1987, he was based in New York City, owning and operating a freelance studio from 1975. In 1987, he moved to Santa Fe where he did extensive work with the palladium printing process, with a focus on landscapes and Native American culture as principal subject matter. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1989, he photographed the American Indian activist Leonard Peltier in Leavenworth Penitentiary. Deeply touched by this encounter, Kennedy became engaged with American Indian causes, which led him to a 1991 visit to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota where he met Severt Young Bear. Young Bear guided Kennedy deeper into the culture, including inviting Kennedy to take photographs of Dancers. Recognizing the sensitivity, even potential sacrilege, of photographing Dancers, Kennedy works within certain guidelines, including only with the specific approval of the Tribal People, among other essential elements before proceeding.</field>
