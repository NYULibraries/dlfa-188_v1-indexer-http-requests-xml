    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The John J. Vrooman Photograph Collection contains photographs of historically significant sites in New York State. These images show pre-Revolutionary War era landmarks throughout the Mohawk Valley and surrounding countryside. The images were used to illustrate Vrooman's book Forts and Firesides of the Mohawk Country, New York, first published in 1943.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains 56 silver gelatin prints taken by John J. Vrooman. They are all matted; most with notes regarding the image, which appear to have been written by someone other than Vrooman. During processing, the images and notes were compared to the images in Forts and Firesides of Mohawk Country, New York, and several differences were found. In those cases, the book was deemed to carry the correct information, and that information is recorded here, with the handwritten notes recorded in brackets. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs have been organized alphabetically by town/site shown. The date each photograph was taken is given when available. Over time, some of the location names have changed. Current location names, as well as alternative names for sites, are listed in parentheses. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">John J. Vrooman was an author and historian, born in 1882 in Schenectady, New York, a town founded by his ancestors. He graduated from the University of Arizona, attended Union College and received an honorary PhD from Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York. Although Vrooman traveled throughout the country, working at a variety of jobs, such as managing a ranch in Iowa, taking part in an investment business in Missouri and operating a real estate business in Mississippi, he eventually returned to Schenectady. In 1944, he accepted the position of Supervisor of Historic Sites for the New York State Education Department, a job he held until 1951. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">John Vrooman's continued interest in New York State is evident in his photographs and writing. He wrote several works of fiction and non-fiction; his books all deal with historic locations and events in upstate New York. His photographs of historic sites illustrate many of his books, and were also used to illustrate material produced for the New York State Education Department. After his retirement from the Education Department, John Vrooman lectured about historic New York State, including a talk given at the New-York Historical Society in 1956 and remained active in historic studies until his death in 1960, at age 78.</field>
