    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection is an artificial collection created over the course of many years in the
Department of Prints, Photographs, and Architectural Collections. Small donations of prints or photographs
of views of geographic locations have been filed here. The collection contains, in addition to prints and
photographs, some newspaper clippings, some reproductions of paintings and other items in the N-YHS
Museum collection, and some ephemera. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is divided into seven series: </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: New York City Views - Manhattan;</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: New York City Views - the Bronx;</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III: New York City Views - Brooklyn;</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV: New York City Views - Queens;</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series V: New York City Views - Staten Island;</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VI: American Views;</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VII: Foreign Views</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Within each series, material is separately housed by size. Boxes hold material smaller than
approximately 12 x 14 inches. Larger material is housed flat in folders in drawers. Oversize material is
generally larger than 30 x 40 inches. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Boxed material is described to the folder level. Some larger material has
been described to the item level. Oversize material is all described to the item level, to facilitate use and
reduce unnecessary handling. See individual series descriptions for more cataloging information.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">
Series I- through Series V, New York City Views is arranged in an organizational structure first by borough, and then by topic of the view.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">AERIAL views are those taken from airplanes or from the top of a tall building or birds-eye views (generally 19th-century prints). Aerial views of lower Manhattan include views of the World Trade Center. Aerial views of midtown include views of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building.
Aerial views of uptown include images of Central Park, Grant's Tomb, Riverside Drive and Riverside Park.
Harbor views are those which show the shore and skyline from the water, or from across some
body of water. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">RIVERS, ISLANDS, and BRIDGES are arranged alphabetically.  Most buildings on islands (for example, asylums on Roosevelt Island) are filed under general Buildings
headings. It behooves researchers to look under both headings to be sure of complete coverage.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">STREET SCENES are views along streets and avenues. Some show a small portion of one block,
some show several blocks. For views that specifically spotlight one building, search under BUILDINGS.
However, researchers should also search the street scenes for other images of a specific building, especially
those which may also show surrounding buildings and street and sidewalk traffic. Street scenes are arranged
alphabetically or numerically. A few named squares have their own folder (i.e. Herald Square and Times
Square). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">PARKS and GARDENS include images of parks and gardens, some now defunct, throughout New York City. A few gardens run as commercial enterprises, such as Elgin's Botanic Garden can be found here.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">BUILDINGS are prints or photographs that spotlight a specific building. Churches, synagogues and other houses of worship are filed
alphabetically by name following the organization provided in David Dunlap's encyclopedic work From
Abyssinian to Zion, which is available for reference. Government buildings include police and fire stations.
Residences are filed alphabetically by the last name of the owner, or by their own name, if applicable. Cross-
references have been provided in those cases. Named apartment complexes are filed in alphabetically with
residences, and unnamed apartment buildings can be found at the end of the run.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">TRANSPORTATION includes images of all sorts of transportation found within the boundaries of
New York City. For more general transportation (i.e. generic railroad images), look in the Subject File (PR
068). This category mainly includes images of buses, carriages, elevated railroads and subway images. Images
of shipping boats can sometimes be found in Harbor Views, and also in the Maritime History File (PR 100).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">EVENTS include views of special events, such as parades, funeral processions, and celebrations.
Researchers looking for parade images should also check street scenes for those streets that are often parade
routes, such as Broadway and Fifth Avenue. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Material housed in boxes includes many photos by Beecher Ogden, and also a great many images
(most copy photographs) collected, and donated, by George Bagoe.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Material housed flat has been separated into two categories based on format: Prints and Photographs.
Within each format, material has been arranged into the above categories. Each image filed under the Buildings
categories is separately listed in the finding aid below. In other categories, attempts have been made to
provide more specific information about images in each folder, to reduce browsing and encourage more
specific use.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VI. American Views is arranged alphabetically by state. Within states, views of cities are also
arranged alphabetically. In the boxed views, if five or more views of a city exist, that city received its own
folder. Within each city, additional folders were also created for buildings, etc. with five or more views.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VII. Foreign Views is arranged alphabetically by country. Current (as of 2006), and not
contemporaneous, names of countries were used. Each country for which there is a view is listed. In the
boxed views, if five or more views of a city within a country exist, that city received its own folder.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Material is a combination of gifts and purchases. Individual dates or information can be found on the
verso of most items.</field>
