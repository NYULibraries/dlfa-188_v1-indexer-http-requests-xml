    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Time-Life Travel Club Files document the short-lived attempt by Time-Life Books to run a travel service. Records include the proposal, finances, trip ideas, correspondence and contracts with associated vendors, and the master report summarizing the venture.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Time-Life Travel Club (TLTC) started in March 1971 as a pilot program with 1000 members from the United States east coast. It was headed by Time-Life Books assistant to the publisher Ralph Gallagher as the director and Frank Farrell as the associate director. A January 1971 memorandum from Gallagher describes the TLTC as a service that would "evaluate all existing packaged travel opportunities" and deliver to members a monthly newsletter along with travel recommendations that "match their individual tastes, desires, and pocketbooks." The TLTC cited the cables sent in by Time Inc. news correspondents as prime sources for destination information. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The TLTC registered as a travel agent with several airlines. Members on recommended trips would receive news briefings for their area. The TLTC folded around 1973.</field>
