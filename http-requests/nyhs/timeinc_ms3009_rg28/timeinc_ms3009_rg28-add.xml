    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Books Group Records include office files from the executive level the group vice president documenting oversight of and major changes and decisions for all departments, offices, and subsidiaries within the Books Groups; newsletters and financial records from the Books and Arts Associates, the group created to monitor investments in foreign publishing companies; samples of the series sent out by the music subscription service Time-Life Records, later renamed Time-Life Music; files on the special project undertaken by Time Inc. to assist in the set up of a educational publisher in Iran; and files from the short-lived club offering travel services.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Books were published by the various magazines prior to the formation of the Books division. According to The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise, 1960-1980, Life's book projects were the most successful, and the Life books division is what became the separate Book Division in 1961.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Book Division formed with Jerome Hardy as publisher and Norman Ross as editor. Time Inc. announced this new division in a January 9, 1961 press release stating it already had fourteen books projects underway. The group is called the Book Division until Time Inc. names it Time-Life Books in the 1963 corporate annual report. There was never an official announcement of the name change. The group was still referred to as the books division (in lowercase) interchangeably with Time-Life Books. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1968 an executive oversight group called "Books, Arts and Recordings" was created led by vice presidents Rhett Austell and Charles Bear. According to an August 1968 staff memorandum, the group's primary function was to coordinate the activities of the Book Division with the related activities of the book publishing subsidiaries Little, Brown and Company and New York Graphic Society; and to work with executives from partially-owned subsidiary General Learning Corporation and the foreign publishers in which Time Inc. owned minority interests.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The 1969 annual report has the first mention of the Books and Arts Associates (BAA), a new advisory management group for book publishing foreign investments. Austell is now the executive vice president overseeing Books, Broadcast, Films, Records, and the BAA. The BAA also briefly oversaw the domestic publishing subsidiaries Little, Brown and Company and the New York Graphic Society. By 1975 BAA's oversight diminished, and its responsibilities were slowly taken over by the Books Group executive office. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1989 a new unit called Books Direct formed and included Time-Life Books and the subsidiary Book-of-the-Month Club. A press release announcing this new unit describes Time-Life Books as the "Largest direct marketer of continuity book, music and video products." In 1990 Time-Life Books was renamed Time Life Inc.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to the 1974 annual report, Time-Life Books primarily published book series on broad topics and marketed them by direct mail. It occasionally published single-subject volumes. Internationally Time-Life books were printed in 26 languages. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">DEPARTMENTS AND SUBSIDIARIES</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While Time-Life Books was Time Inc.'s main publishing unit, the Books Group oversaw several other book publishing, subscription, or direct marketing ventures and companies acquired by Time Inc. The major subsidiaries were the textbook publisher Silver Burdett, acquired in 1962; the Boston-based publishing house Little, Brown and Company acquired in 1968; and the Book-of-the-Month Club officially acquired in 1977 although it worked with Time-Life Books prior to that. In November 1965, Time Inc. and General Electric (GE) create the General Learning Corporation (GLC) consisting of Silver Burdett and capital from GE. Scott Foresman and Company purchased GLC in July 1974. </field>
