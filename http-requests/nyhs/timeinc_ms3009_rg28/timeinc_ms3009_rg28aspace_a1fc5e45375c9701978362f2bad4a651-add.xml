    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Iran Publishing Project Files include records on this contract project undertaken by Time Inc. and staffed by Time-Life Books employees. The majority of files looks like they came from the supervising Time-Life Books executive Robert Ellis. Records include the initial studies, invoices submitted by Time Inc. to Danesheh Now, correspondence with on-site project director Iradj Bagherzade, and court records from the claim filed by Time Inc. with the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sherkate Chap va Nashreh Danesheh Now (Danesheh Now, sometimes called Daneshe Now) formed in 1976, but did not start operations until 1978. The idea for the educational publishing venture originated with the Empress Farah and her Special Bureau and was funded by the Industrial and Mining Development Bank of Iran. The venture contracted Time Inc. to perform initial studies as early as 1971 to determine if there was enough demand in Iran for a new publishing company. Time Inc. was also to provide book licensing, expert assistance and staff training staff. According to The World of Time Inc., Time Inc. was chosen because of president James Linen's long acquaintance with the Shah. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">From the records, it looks like Washington-based Time-Life Books executive Robert Ellis was in charge of this project with Iradj Bagherzade, previously of Time-Life Books Europe, as the on-site project director. Danesheh Now published thirteen books in 1978. In November 1978, because of the unrest in Iran, the remaining Time Inc. employees left the country. Time Inc. later filed a claim with the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal regarding payment for services. White and Case was the legal representative.
