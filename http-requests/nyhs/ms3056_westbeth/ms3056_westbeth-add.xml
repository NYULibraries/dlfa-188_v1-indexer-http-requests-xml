    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although the Westbeth Playwrights' Feminist Collective Records contain scattered materials dating from as recently as 2015, the bulk of the collection stems from the period of the organization's existence, 1971–1975. It includes foundational documents (certificate of incorporation; petition for dissolution; see box 1, folder 2), information on grants received from the New York State Council on the Arts (box 1, folder 4), correspondence (box 1, folder 3), and photographs of members and select productions (box 1, folder 5). Most of the other items document WPFC productions through small-format posters, flyers, and programs (box 1, folder 6; box 3, folder 6), press releases (box 3, folder 4), and articles and reviews (box 1, folder 1). Production-specific materials include scripts, box office reports, and, in two cases, tape recordings of music for the performances (box 2, folders 6 and 10). [Note that until these tapes have been preservation reformatted, they may not be played.] Many of the WPFC productions were multi-authored revues, or series of short sketches; some scripts are lacking, and these have been noted by the donor (see the container list, box 2, folders 5–9).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Westbeth Playwrights' Feminist Collective (WPFC)—named for its headquarters in the Westbeth Artists' Housing  (in the historic Bell Telephone Laboratories Complex at 445-465 West Street, Manhattan)—was one of the earliest feminist theater groups in the United States. Incorporated on 19 October 1972, its founding members included the multitalented playwrights Helen Duberstein, Hélène Dworzan, Patricia Horan, Gwendolyn Gunn, Christina (a.k.a. Chryse) Maile, Sally Ordway, Dolores Deane Walker, and Susan Yankowitz. Its board of sponsors, a who's who of American feminism of the day, included theatre critic Margaret Croyden, activist Florynce Kennedy, poet Muriel Rukeyser, and Ms. magazine cofounder Gloria Steinem.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The plays of the WPFC focused on issues at the core of the women's movement like sexual harassment, workplace inequality, dominance and submission, and the exclusion of female celebrants by the religious patriarchy. Productions were staged in several Manhattan venues, among them the Theatre for the New City, Joseph Jefferson Company, and—at Westbeth—the Westbeth Cabaret and Gallery Theater. Titles include "Rape-In" (May 1971), "Up! An Uppity Revue" (February 1972), "Wicked Women Revue" (January 1973), "? ! A Revue" (May 1973), "We Can Feed Everybody Here" (January 1974), "What Time of Night It Is" (May 1974), "Medea" (January 1975), and "Jumpin' Salty" (April 1975). As publicity for "Jumpin' Salty"—which showcased the lives of notable women in American history like birth control advocate Margaret Sanger and the largely female victims of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire—the WPFC organized a march through Greenwich Village, with stops to hear speakers at sites connected to the women and events.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The WPFC staged a production of the Gertrude Stein-Virgil Thomson opera based on the life of Susan B. Anthony, "The Mother of Us All" (April-May 1976). They also sponsored readings by poets like Judy Grahn and Honor Moore, and hosted screenings of the work of women filmmakers. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The WPFC disbanded in 1976. Its members went on to pursue individual careers. Some continued (and continue) to write for the stage. Others became lawyers, bishops, printmakers, and landscape architects. </field>
