    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists primarily of Hannah Campbell's personal correspondence with family members, spanning the years from the late 1950's to the early 1980's.  Campbell's frequent letters include vivid descriptions of her personal and professional life and paint an interesting portrait of her daily life as a single professional woman in New York City during this time period.  Of equal interest is Campbell's southern perspective on her experiences. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A smaller amount of business correspondence is also included, along with copies of Campbell's published articles and a copy of her book.  Items of special interest include an article about an African-American-owned grocery store chain in Greesborok, NC. and correspondence regarding a proposed book on the subject of beauty for African-American women.</field>

She worked as a professional stenographer and legal secretary from the late 1940's through 1957. In 1958, she moved to New York City to pursue a career as a writer. She worked for various publications, including Cosmopolitan (1958-1961), Field  &amp; Stream (1963-ca. 1967), and Reader's Digest (ca. 1967-1982).
