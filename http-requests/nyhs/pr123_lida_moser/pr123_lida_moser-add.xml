    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Lida Moser Photograph Collection contains thirteen gelatin silver photographic prints, taken in 1971 and 1978 of the former Washington Market area of lower Manhattan, prior to and during the construction of the World Trade Center.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs include views of demolition sites, individual streets, tenements and commercial buildings in the Washington Market district that were affected or demolished during the course of construction. A number of images include views of Greenwich, Washington, Harrison, and other streets, with the World Trade Center towers in various stages of construction in the background. Also included is a single photograph taken by Moser in 1978 from the top of the World Trade Center towers, facing northeast towards Brooklyn and Long Island. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After working in a motion picture studio, doing camera work, sound and film editing, Lida Moser was convinced by a colleague to try still photography. She immediately took to it, enjoying the total control she had over the process.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1947, Moser became an assistant in Berenice Abbott's studio, helping to organize a collection of Eugene Atget prints and negatives. After leaving Abbott's studio, Moser photographed for various magazines including Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Look. She worked as staff photographer for Playwright's Inc., a Broadway theatre production company, for two years. She worked with realist painter John Koch, photographing him, his work, exhibits and events, from 1954 to 1974. She also wrote several books on photography, created images for book cover art, and worked as photojournalist in several countries, taking photographs for over 60 years.</field>
