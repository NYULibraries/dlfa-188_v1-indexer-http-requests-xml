    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Negatives series includes the negatives for many of the photographic prints found in the other series of the Pictorial Archive record group. It also likely includes some images for which there are not prints. Images  include those of exhibitions, buildings (interior and exterior), programs and events, objects, and staff. Formats are both glass and film of various sizes (8x10, 5x7, 4x5, and 35 mm strips). Further information on the subject matter of negatives and the approximate number of related negatives for each subject is included in the container list below. Each negative  is  individually enclosed in an envelope that often  includes descriptive information that is not always noted on the prints , such as date, event, and names of people in the image.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Negatives included in this series are only those that were held in the N-YHS Print Room's negative files. Other negatives were found in some of the folders of prints and were left in those folders; see the above series descriptions for those negatives.</field>
