    <field name="abstract_teim">The Montauk Division was a regional branch, founded in 1844, of the Sons of Temperance, a fraternal order that assisted its members, both in remaining temperate, and as a mutual aid society. The records reflect the practical operation of a nineteenth-century fraternal organization and are composed of meeting minutes, committee reports, bills and receipts, printed circulars, letters, membership applications, inventories, proposed amendments, records of visitations to sick brothers and investigations of brothers.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records offer insight into the practical operation of a nineteenth-century fraternal organization. They cover aspects such as finances, the activities of the local division and wider organization, upkeep of the meeting hall, the management of its membership -- including investigations into allegations of transgressions of the group's rules and visitations, and payments to qualifying members. The records are composed of meeting minutes, committee reports, bills and receipts, printed circulars, letters, membership applications, inventories, proposed amendments, records of visitations to sick brothers and investigations of brothers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Sons of Temperance, a total abstinence society, was founded in New York in 1842. The fraternal order provided assistance for its members, both in remaining temperate, and as a mutual aid society. More broadly, they promoted the societal benefit of abstinence and temperance. The Montauk Division, a regional branch of the Sons of Temperance, was founded in Sag Harbor, in 1844.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In contrast to its immediate predecessor, the Washington Movement, the Sons recruited members from among those already well affected to their cause. Though they refrained from taking public stances on religious and political matters, they did advocate ending the temptation by stopping the production and sale of alcohol.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">As a mutual aid society, the Sons of Temperance doled out sickness and disability benefits and allotted money to assist with the burial of fellow brothers and their wives. The attractiveness of its benefits led the organization to operate as a secret society, with stringent rules and a highly restricted membership. Allegations of intemperance and other transgressions were routinely investigated and often led to expulsion from the organization.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Though the Sons of Temperance survived through the Civil War, the Montauk Division ceased operation in 1865, replaced by the Agawam Division in 1867. </field>
