    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of approximately 35 letters written between 1945 and 1947 by Annette Dyar to her family at home in Eureka, Illinois (810 South Main Street). During this time, Annette's father, Wilmer Merit Dyar (1884–1974), was assistant superintendent of the Woodford County Schools. Her mother, Emma Grace (Fish) Dyar (1886–1959), was a homemaker. Annette's younger brothers, Paul Edwin Dyar (1922–2004) and John Richard "Jack" Dyar (1924–1991), had just completed their wartime service with the U.S. Army Air Corps and U.S. Army Special Services Division. An older brother, Wilmer Eugene "Gene" Dyar (1916–1942), a bombardier with the Army Air Corps, was shot down and reported missing in action in 1942.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Immediately after her employment as a cryptanalytic aide with the U.S. Army Signal Corps ended, Annette moved from Washington, D.C. to New York City in early 1946. A graduate of the University of Illinois with a degree in library science, she found work at the St. Agnes Branch of the New York Public Library. Her letters chronicle her busy activities there, dinners with friends, church services she attended, excursions back to Washington, and her moves from one Manhattan apartment to the next. During this period (1945–1947) she lived at four addresses: 138 East 38th Street (Tatham House, Y.W.C.A.); 126 Riverside Drive; 40 Sherman Avenue (where she roomed with a Mrs. Hoskins or Haskins); and 147 East 60th Street. The last address she would soon share with her first husband, fellow librarian William James "Bill" Elliott, who appears as one of several young men Annette dated towards the end of the series, and whom she married on January 31, 1947. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Annette Dyar, a native of Eureka, Illinois, was born on October 23, 1919 to Wilmer Merit and Emma Grace (Fish) Dyar. Her father served as assistant superintendent of the Woodford County Schools. Her mother was a homemaker. Annette obtained a bachelor's degree from Eureka College in 1941, and a degree in library science from the University of Illinois in 1942. After graduate school she was employed as a cryptanalytic aide by the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II; even late in life she refused to reveal details of her classified war work. In 1946 she moved to Manhattan, where she began working as a librarian in the New York Public Library system. During the period covered by the present collection, she worked at NYPL's St. Agnes Branch on the Upper West Side. Employed by NYPL until 1970, she next worked for the Miami-Dade Public Library System until 1986. She retired to Marietta, Georgia, in 1991, and returned to her birthplace in 2002. Annette Dyar married fellow librarian William James Elliott in New York in 1947. She married her second husband, Forman Sherman, in 1995. Annette Dyar Sherman died in Eureka, age 100, on August 30, 2020.</field>
