    <field name="bioghist_teim">Samuel Kuklin, Margaret Tomlinson, and Virginia Vonne were residents of the Imperial Court Hotel (307 West 79th Street), on Manhattan's Upper West Side, during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.

Samuel L. Kuklin (1887–1956) was a wholesale dealer of furniture, whose many contacts in the trade are reflected in the business cards in Box 3, Folder 8.

Margaret Matilda Tomlinson (1888–1963?) was a Canadian-born, naturalized U.S. citizen who worked as a maid and nurse in New York City. A portion of her correspondence in Box 3, Folder 9 deals with her attempts to secure personal health care.

Virginia Vonne (born in Missouri about 1917) was a singer known to have performed in at least two Broadway musicals: "Hooray For What!" at the Winter Garden Theatre (December 1, 1937–May 21, 1938) and "Blossom Time" at the 46th Street Theatre (December 26, 1938–January 7, 1939).</field>
