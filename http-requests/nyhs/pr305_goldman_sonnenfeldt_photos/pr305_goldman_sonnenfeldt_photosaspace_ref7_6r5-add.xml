    <field name="bioghist_teim">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), advertised as the stable of "more stars than there are in Heaven," dominated the American movie industry in the 1930s. Its profits equalled three-quarters the total of the remaining Big Eight studios combined. Under the leadership of Louis B. Meyer and head of production Irving Thalberg, MGM enraptured Depression-era audiences with its dependable product of escapist glamour and sophistication.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">A central figure in the development of the MGM brand was Clarence Sinclair Bull (1886-1979), head of the stills department for over three decades, whose work comprises the majority of this subseries. As described by Hedda Hopper, actress and later gossip columnist who appears in the collection, Bull was "as much of a Metro institution as Leo the Lion." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The son of a Montana cattle rancher, Bull initially sold his images as postcards out of the film printing and development studio he operated from his family's general store. Impressed customer Mrs. Frank Lloyd, wife of the famous film director, arranged for Bull's hiring as an assistant cameraman in  Hollywood in 1917.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Following work for several studios and a shift in concentration to still photography, Bull settled at Goldwyn Studios, which was amalgamated into MGM in 1924. Bull estimated that he photographed over 10,000 separate subjects in his career, and over 4,000 individual studies of Greta Garbo, in the collaboration for which he is most well-regarded. Garbo, notoriously shy and publicity-adverse, elected Bull as her sole personal photographer from 1929 onwards. Bull was also responsible  for enhancing the image of all of MGM's stars, including favorite subjects Jean Harlow, Clark Gable, Gloria Swanson, Lon Chaney, the Barrymores, and later Katharine Hepburn, Robert Mitchum, and Elizabeth Taylor.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the mid-1950s, Bull was sent by the studio on his own publicity campaign, making television and radio appearances and speaking before camera clubs. Before his death in 1979, Bull was able to see his work commemorated and exhibited, and was bestowed the degree of Honorary Master by the Professional Photographers of America. "In portraits, " he said, "I have tried to capture a moment  or mood unattainable with the motion picture camera."</field>
