    <field name="bioghist_teim">Photojournalist Ken Regan (d. 2012) worked for over five decades prolifically documenting pop culture, sports, foreign conflicts, and other current events. Credited with over 200 magazine covers, Regan was most well-known for a discretion and professionalism which earned him intimate shooting access to famous politicians, musicians, and other celebrities.   </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born in the Bronx, Regan received a camera for his 12th birthday and began shooting sports and musical events as the Mount Saint Michael Academy school photographer. He studied journalism at Columbia and attended New York University Film School. His first paid assignment, from the New York Times Sunday Magazine, was to cover the famous Thanksgiving rock concert at the Fillmore East featuring Jefferson Airplane and Johnny Winter; his work ultimately resulted in a three-page spread. Regan sent self-made prints of his work along with a thank you note to the concert promoter Bill Graham. This unusual practice, which he continued throughout his career, inaugurated a symbiotic relationship with Graham, who later established Regan as house photographer to The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Regan also covered major sports events for magazines Time, Sports Illustrated, Life, and Newsweek.  
In the 1970s he founded Camera 5, an agency of 15 photographers who covered wars, riots and demonstrations, and other national and international hard news and human interest stories. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition, Regan served as the self-proclaimed "unofficial Kennedy family photographer" for thirty years, amassing one of the largest bodies of photographs of the Camelot political dynasty in both public and private settings. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Regan's work continually appeared in a wide range of major publications including Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone, and People, who often called upon Regan to capture unguarded moments from camera weary celebrities. "We trust him," musician James Taylor wrote of Regan in his 2011 publication of rock and roll photography All Access, "We can be ourselves around him. He is one of us." Regan additionally published Knockout: The Art of Boxing in 2007.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Of his photography goals, Regan said "I think that if you're able to capture an image that nobody else has then that's what makes the image important; that's what people are interested in." Increased publicist control over celebrity access and the advent of digital photography reduced magazine travel assignments, prompting Regan's turn towards corporate film and television work in the 90s. He developed continuing working relationships with directors Jonathan Demme and Clint Eastwood, among others, for whom he shot on-set production photography. Regan died on November 25, 2012.</field>
