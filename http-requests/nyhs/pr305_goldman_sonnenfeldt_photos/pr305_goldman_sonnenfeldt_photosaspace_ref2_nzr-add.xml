    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Hollywood Film series represents the American film industry's publicity output from the late silent period into what is generally regarded as the "Golden Era" (between 1920 and 1960). In  this period, the studios meticulously and rigorously controlled the image of their contracted stars, generating and distributing photographs to fans and publications. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Special photography units were established at each studio to create publicity images of performers away from production sets and costumes. A majority of materials in this series represent this output; many are studio portraits but also present are candid and staged shots depicting subjects at home, with their families and friends, engaging in physical and outdoor activities, and performing beauty regimens. Photographs are variously labelled or stamped with sitter, production, original collection, date, studio, credit lines, and photographer; in some cases, original annotations and publicity captions are present. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The work of the pioneer film portraitists depicted in the collection helped define careers and created a resonating iconography of Hollywood.  Legendary and established stars appear in the collection alongside character actors, ingenues, and animal performers. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Output from Clarence S. Bull and other in-house photographers of preeminent studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer comprises the first subseries. Recurring performers depicted in this subseries (1929-1943) are Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Walter Huston, Adolpe Menjou, Robert Montgomery, Maureen O'Sullivan, Mickey Rooney, Walter Pigeon, Rosalind Russell, Jimmy Stewart, and Robert Young. Select writers, directors (Rouben Mamoulian), and other crew are also present, as are the homes of Huston and Myrna Loy.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The second subseries features work outside of Metro-Goldwyn Mayer and therefore comprises a wider range of image subjects, sitters, photographers, dates, and sources. All the major studios -- Warner Bros, Universal, Paramount, RKO, Fox Corporation, and Columbia Pictures -- as well as independents Republic Pictures and Selznick International are represented. Earlier subjects include silent stars Betty Compson, Hoot Gibson, Lew Cody, Wallace Reid, and Florence Vidor. Later iconic stars of the talkies Henry Fonda and Ginger Rogers appear recurrently in the collection, as do Jean Hersholt, Henry Hull, and the producer Joan Harrison. The work of Polish photographer Roman Freulich (1898-1974), of Universal and later Republic, is well represented. Other photographers featured include John Miehle (RKO, Selznick International), George Hurrell, George Hommel, and Gene Robert Richee.</field>
