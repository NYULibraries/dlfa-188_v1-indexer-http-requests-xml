    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists of letters received by John Rutherfurd, and responses drafted by him or on his behalf. The subseries is arranged chronologically.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For the most part, the letters concern John Rutherfurd's landholdings in New York and New Jersey. Specific matters relating to John Rutherfurd's landholdings include tenants, sale and lease of lands, collection of rents, and legal matters relating to land titles. Other general subjects include the raising of sheep and the quality of wool, and proposals for the construction of roads and bridges in New Jersey, particularly the Paterson - Hamburg Turnpike. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are very few items in the collection that would indicate that a given correspondent wrote frequently to John Rutherfurd. John and Richard Duncan occasionally wrote to John Rutherfurd regarding a debt owed by John Duncan to Rutherfurd and others, and other creditors of Duncan sometimes wrote to Rutherfurd. Several letters of Robert Boggs address the sale of sheep's wool, Elias van Arsdale wrote periodically on legal matters, and Margaret White wrote about legal and business matters that John Rutherfurd managed for her family. In several letters dated 1786, the Rev. John Frederick Ernst inquired about an advertisement for settlers in the Chenango Tract, offering his congregation as candidates. Another cluster of letters, from 1827, consists of several letters that Eliza M. Evans wrote to John Rutherfurd concerning a land dispute between Rutherfurd and her family. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also in the series are drafts of letters sent to various persons, including Rev. Ernst, Mrs. Evans (presumably Eliza M. Evans), and Richard Duncan. Other subjects in the drafts include the estate of Gen. John Reid, and his shares in the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal. </field>
