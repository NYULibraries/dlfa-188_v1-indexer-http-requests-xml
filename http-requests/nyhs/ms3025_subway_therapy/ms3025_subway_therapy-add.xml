    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection includes about 5,600 of the approximately 20,000 sticky notes from artist Matthew "Levee" Chavez's work Subway Therapy. The work was initiated by Chavez on 9 November 2016 and it ended on 16 December 2016. The work consisted of notes posted by individuals to the wall of the New York City subway station at Sixth Avenue and 14th Street, expressing their emotions in response to the U.S. presidential election held on 8 November 2016, won by Donald J. Trump.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Subway Therapy collection includes about 5,600 of the approximately 20,000 sticky notes posted in the Sixth Avenue at 14th Street subway station between 9 November and 16 December 2016 in connection with artist Matthew "Levee" Chavez's work Subway Therapy. The bulk of the notes came from one section of the wall, which the artist identified to the N-YHS conservator removing the slips as one of the earliest sections to be posted. A small number of other notes along the wall were individually selected for inclusion by a N-YHS museum curator.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On Tuesday, 8 November 2016, Americans elected the Republican Party candidate, Donald J. Trump, to succeed Barack Obama as President of the United States. Trump's victory over Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton was a surprise, even a severe disappointment, for many Americans, including for residents of New York City who had voted heavily in favor of Clinton. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On the day after the election, artist Matthew "Levee" Chavez initiated a project by which New Yorkers could express their emotions about the election result. He took sticky notes (e.g., Post-its) and pens into the Metropolitan Transit Authority's subway station at Sixth Avenue and 14th Street, and posted the invitation to"Express Yourself" on the tiled walls. On that day and for weeks after, thousands of people did express themselves on the small sticky notes, eventually filling long ranges of the subway station wall, stretching to Union Square. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By mid-December, the initial impulse for the project had run its course and the size of the constantly growing work had made it unsustainable at a major transportation point. Consequently, the artist chose to end the project, removing about 20,000 notes on 16 December 2016. In doing so, by prior arrangement he worked with New-York Historical Society conservator Alan Balicki to preserve about 5,000 of the notes for donation to N-YHS.</field>
