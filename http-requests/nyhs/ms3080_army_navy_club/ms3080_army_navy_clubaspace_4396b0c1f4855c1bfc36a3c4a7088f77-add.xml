    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Membership files include applications of former, deceased, and rejected members.  There are no membership files for those members who were active in the Club at the time the collection was donated, which was likely in the mid 1970s.  Nearly all members who are listed as dropped were marked as such for the failure to pay their yearly dues.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Membership applications became more detailed throughout time, but include information such as the name, date, and place of birth of the applicant, the names of the applicant's parents, the applicant's religion, occupation, educational history, military service, and character references.  There is usually correspondence to and from the applicant attached to the application.  </field>
