    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection documents the life and work of Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, a landscape architect and parks advocate. Rogers published several monographs on New York environmental history and landscape design, as well as multiple articles on urban renewal and history. She was appointed Central Park Administrator by Mayor Ed Koch in 1979 and was a founding member and president of the Central Park Conservancy in 1980; she retired from both positions in 1995. Her papers illustrate the breadth of her career and public life as well as the physical, economic, and social changes that New York underwent since the 1970s. Materials include manuscripts, published materials, photos and audiovisual material, and correspondence.</field>

    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1906-2020 (bulk 1960s-2010s)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection includes a wide array of oversized, photographic, audiovisual, and ephemeral material. The bulk of the papers are Rogers' manuscripts and writing materials, both published and unpublished. Her monographs such as Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2001) and The Forests and Wetlands of New York City (New York: Little, Brown, 1971) appear in finished form, surrounded by drafts, research, and correspondence that sketch the writing process from start to finish. The related correspondence, publicity, and press present a full picture of her writing career and research achievements. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rogers' personal life is not well documented in the collection. She was born in San Antonio, Texas to C. L. and Elizabeth Browning. Her husband, Theodore C. Rogers, and her children appear in photographs at special events. There are some written materials from her two brothers and parents, especially related to her early work as a research aide to New York State Senator, Whitney North Seymour Jr. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also houses important documents, photographs, and publications around Rogers' career in the NYC Parks Department and her founding of the Central Park Conservancy (CPC). Materials include reports, outreach, and correspondence with collaborators in city government, New York society, and the global parks administration community. Her public life is well documented through speeches, photographs, correspondence, press, and awards. Many notable civic and artistic individuals appear in Rogers' photographs and correspondence including Robert Moses, Ed Koch, George H.W. Bush, Yoko Ono, and Brooke Astor. She was part of civic movements across New York City that responded to the fiscal crisis of the 1970s and the ensuing revitalization and urban renewal efforts of public-private partnerships. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Another key aspect of the collection is Rogers' teaching materials, which often have a global focus that expands the research scope of the collection to outside New York. Rogers taught courses on landscape design and architecture, garden history, and New York environmental history at institutions such as Columbia University, the Cooper Union, Bard Graduate Center, and the New York Botanical Garden. She also established programs of study in Landscape Studies at Bard Graduate Center and founded the Center for Landscape Studies. In addition to coursework, lecture notes, and planning materials, there is a notable spread of clippings and periodicals that mention Rogers or her institutional affiliations. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many items in the collection have been labeled by the donor prior to gifting the material to N-YHS. There are multiple instances where Rogers has annotated documents and objects with notes that describe their context or relevance to her life and work. These have always been preserved with the material and are also reflected in the arrangement and description of the collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are also 3 CDs, 5 DVDs, and 9 VHS tapes across the collection that hold documentaries, interviews, and recordings from Rogers' events and speeches. Finally, there are oversized materials that include architectural designs and blueprints for Central Park projects, large photographs, and printed ephemera.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Elizabeth Barlow Rogers (born 1936) is a prominent architectural and landscape historian, conservationist, and urban advocate. She is a former administrator of Central Park (1979-1995) and is a lifetime trustee of the Central Park Conservancy (CPC), which she helped establish in 1980. She also founded the Central Park Taskforce in 1975. Rogers served as the President of the CPC from 1980-1995. The goals of the Central Park Conservancy include revitalizing the physical infrastructure of the park, reorienting its goals and management, and expanding the role of the park in New York City civic life. The CPC is a public-private partnership which brings private philanthropic funds into the service of maintaining and providing a public good or service; it was one of the first forms of public-private partnership established by then-Mayor Ed Koch in 1980. Since then, public-private partnerships like the CPC have been replicated throughout New York City. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rogers was selected for the dual role of Central Park Administrator and CPC President due to her history of advocacy and passion for civic engagement. Further, she was an accomplished writer and expert on parks, landscape design, and New York environmental history. Her publishing career includes titles such as The Forests and Wetlands of New York City (New York: Little, Brown, 1971), for which she won a John Burroughs Medal, Frederick Law Olmsted's New York (New York: Whitney Museum/Praeger, 1972), The Central Park Book (Central Park Task Force, 1977), Rebuilding Central Park: A Management and Restoration Plan (MIT Press, 1987), and her self-described magnum opus Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History (New York: Abrams, 2001). All of her book projects in the collection are surrounded by contextual research, manuscripts in various stages, feedback from experts in the field, and correspondence with publishers and advocates. Her expertise on New York and Central Park is contextualized in a wider philosophical and historical framework of space and place and the relationship between humans and their built environments; this theme undergirds her civic and professional work as well as her personal papers. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rogers also taught courses on landscape design and history at several institutions in New York. Her teaching materials are similarly robust and help illustrate her academic achievements as well as her passion for sharing landscape history beyond the park. Her teaching materials are geographically diverse, demonstrating her wide range of knowledge. She collaborated with multiple parks officials and scholars within the United States and abroad in Europe and Asia. She has continued to advocate for landscape studies; her Foundation of Landscape Studies was integrated into the  University of Virginia's Landscape Studies Initiative in 2017. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In her early life, Rogers wrote poetry and speculative historical fiction based on her enjoyment of the New York environment and her interest in New York history. She attended Wellesley College and maintains a close relationship with the institution; she assisted the College in developing plans for the renewal of their campus grounds and has received awards and recognition as an outstanding alumna. She received her Masters degree from Yale University in city planning in 1964 and moved permanently to New York City shortly after. Her social circle includes other members of New York civil society. She maintained close ties with public figures and has been celebrated by numerous organizations for her contributions to New York City. </field>
