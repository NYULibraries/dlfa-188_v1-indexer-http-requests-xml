    <field name="abstract_teim">Approximately 819 black-and-white photographic negatives (18 of which are glass plates) by celebrity and society photographer Bert Morgan (1904–1986) and his son/assistant, Richard Morgan (1936–2012), documenting charity balls, weddings, the annual dog show of the Westminster Kennel Club, and the opening of the National Horse Show, at Manhattan venues such as the Waldorf-Astoria, Madison Square Garden, and Lüchow's restaurant.</field>
    <field name="abstract_ssm">Approximately 819 black-and-white photographic negatives (18 of which are glass plates) by celebrity and society photographer Bert Morgan (1904–1986) and his son/assistant, Richard Morgan (1936–2012), documenting charity balls, weddings, the annual dog show of the Westminster Kennel Club, and the opening of the National Horse Show, at Manhattan venues such as the Waldorf-Astoria, Madison Square Garden, and Lüchow's restaurant.</field>
    <field name="unitdate_teim">circa 1932-1963, 1981 (bulk, 1960-1961)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains approximately 563 sleeves, each holding one or more 4-by-5-inch black-and-white photographic negatives, for an approximate total of 801. A handful of strip film negatives are in color (see the envelope in the back of box 3). And eighteen are 4-by-5-inch glass plate, black-and-white negatives (see box 4).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each sleeve (or envelope) carries typed or handwritten information supplied by the photographer, usually the event, the location, the date, and the names of his subjects. A very few sleeves hold prints of negatives, and some include typed captions, business cards, and the occasional newsclipping.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although Bert Morgan photographed celebrities and socialites at their far-flung haunts, the venues in the current collection are limited to locations in Manhattan: the ballrooms of the Americana, Astor, Plaza, Sheraton-East, and Waldorf-Astoria hotels; the churches of St. Bartholomew, St. Ignatius Loyola, and Fifth Avenue Presbyterian; famous eateries like Lüchow's and the Four Seasons; Madison Square Garden; the Museum of the City of New York; and Bloomingdale's department store.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A majority of the events depicted were charity balls. Besides raising money for some worthy cause, the gatherings provided luminaries with a platform to be seen—and photographed. Morgan's record of his subjects on his negative sleeves (see the container list) reads like a "Who's Who" of late 1950s- early 1960s society, and includes actresses (Eva Gabor), designers (Oleg Cassini), diplomats (Porfirio Rubirosa), foreign dignitaries (Pratap Singh Rao Gaekwad, Maharajah of Baroda), minor royalty (Princess Stephanie of Windisch-Graetz), and the fabulously wealthy (Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney). As many of these charity balls took place during the early 1960s, it is not surprising that "the Twist" makes several appearances in the collection. Morgan notes several couples "doing the Twist." The dance craze was so widespread that at least one fundraiser at the staid Four Seasons was billed as a "twist party" (see box 3, folder 2).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Earlier in his career Morgan documented the dog shows of the Westminster Kennel Club at Madison Square Garden (see box 1, folders 4, 5, and 12), and the annual openings of the National Horse Show (box 1, folder 8; box 2, folder 5; box 3, folder 1), considered to be the start of the social calendar.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By most accounts Bert Morgan (1904–1986) was the dean of society photographers. Between the 1930s and 1980s, wherever the wealthy and notable gathered—New York, Southampton, Newport, or Palm Beach—Morgan was there to photograph them at charity balls, banquets, horse shows, and weddings.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born Bernard Stanley Morgan in England in 1904, "Bert" emigrated with his family to the United States in 1911 and settled in Brooklyn, New York. With a seven-dollar pawn shop camera he began working as a syndicate news photographer in 1919. For a decade Morgan supplied northeastern papers like the New York Daily News with images of the common man. In 1930 he became the official photographer for the Social Spectator. The paper sent Morgan to Palm Springs that winter to capture New York celebrities at play, launching his fifty-year career of documenting their progress from the "Four Hundred" to "Café Society" to the "Jet Set." His son, Richard Morgan (1936–2012), also a photographer, eventually assisted.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Morgan's modus operandi was to position his camera and tripod at some heavily-trafficked hotspot, be it nightclub or racetrack (he was the official photographer for the New York Racing Association) to shoot luminaries as they went by. His gentlemanly demeanor and encyclopedic memory endeared him to his subjects: he could identify thousands of them by name and residence simply by looking at their pictures. At his death Morgan left 1.5-million negatives. Some 500,000 of them make up the Bert Morgan Archive, administered by Archive Farms, Inc.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">[This note is drawn from Morgan's obituary in the Palm Beach Daily News, Sunday 21 September 1986, and from information in South Hampton Blue Book 1930 to 1960: Photographs by Bert Morgan (Shelter Island, N.Y.: Archive Farms, Inc., 2014).]</field>
