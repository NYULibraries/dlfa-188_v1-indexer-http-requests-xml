    <field name="abstract_teim">157 photographs, most taken by John Illo (b. 1926), of passenger ships, tugboats, and warships in New York Harbor. Twelve (not taken by Illo) show the wrecked ocean liner Morro Castle near Asbury Park, New Jersey, around 1934. The collection includes views of well-known Manhattan sites such as the Chrysler Building and McSorley's Old Ale House, and "characters" Illo encountered around New York City, such as men riding the subway, a three-card monte dealer, a man fishing treasure from a sidewalk grate, and men experiencing homelessness. Also present are twenty images of people thought to have been in Vaudeville; two show John Illo's father, Frank Illo (1886-1976), who worked as a stage carpenter in addition to performing.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The John Illo Photograph Collection exhibits three themes:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Ships and waterfront.
Vessels, especially tugboats, in and around New York Harbor, some with visible names, others unidentified (see the container list for specifics), and general views of Manhattan docks and infrastructure. Only two prints are dated (1949 and 1950). Includes twelve snapshots of the wrecked Morro Castle, an ill-fated ocean liner which burned en route from Havana to New York on 8 September 1934, killing 137 passengers and crew members. The  Morro Castle remained beached near Asbury Park, New Jersey, for several months until it was towed away and scrapped. (Illo was 8 years old at the time and did not take these photographs.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">New York City scenes.
Views of some well-known Manhattan sites (see container list for details), with a number of general street scenes. Only one photograph in this set, of the shelves in an antique shop, is dated: 1947.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">People.
Random "characters" Illo encountered on the streets of Manhattan (see the container list for descriptions), and a group of twenty prints thought to show Vaudeville performers who appeared on stage with Frank Illo (1886-1976), who is identified in two photographs. None of these prints are dated.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">New York City native and World War II veteran John Peter Illo (b. 1926) is a graduate of Fordham University and Columbia University (MA and PhD). Now retired, Illo was a professor of English at Shippensburg University in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania.</field>
