    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Accountants Club of America  (ACA) records are comprised of four lists of officers, governors, advisors, and members from years 1989, 1995, 2001, and 2009; minutes of Board of Governors and Advisory Board meetings from 1985-2005, 2007, and 2010; event publicity flyers from 1984 to about 2017; original correspondence and draft constitutions from 1906 related to ACA's predecessor organization, Public Accountants Club; and photocopies of various state filings and by-laws. The filings date primarily from 1973, though there is a photocopy of Accountants Foundation Inc's filing for incorporation from 1927-28. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The minutes primarily concern programming, financial matters, and membership. Minutes of the early 1990s also include reference to long term planning concerning the mission of the organization and foundation funding. Most of the minutes are those of Accountants Club of America Board meetings; but a small number are those of Accountants Forum.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Accountants Club of America (ACA) traces its roots to about 1897 when accountants Charles Waldo Haskins and Elijah Watt Sells (of the firm Haskins and Sells, which later became part of the firm known by 2018 as Deloitte) advocated for informal gatherings of professional accountants. Such meetings were held in the ensuing decades culminating in 1927 with the incorporation of the ACA to provide an ongoing  vehicle for organizing the meetings. Although centered in New York City, "of America" was included in the name to give it national stature. The purpose of the Club, as stated in its by-laws, is "to provide an environment in which professional colleagues in the accounting profession and related fields can meet in a comfortable social setting to exchange ideas, thoughts and information of interest on topics of personal, business, social and professional issues." The organization runs various programs for its members, including speakers, roundtable discussions and social gatherings for networking.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Accountants Forum, Inc. (AFI) was formed in 1941 and is an affiliate of ACA. It is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization that provides financial support for ACA's programs. ACA and AFI share by-laws, officers, and other governance matters.</field>
