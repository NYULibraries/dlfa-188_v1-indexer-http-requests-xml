    <field name="scopecontent_teim">At the heart of Harriet Oxman's papers are the nine notebooks she kept as principal of Erasmus Hall High School between 1972 and 1980, in which she recorded daily happenings—not all of them pleasant—of the school and its community. Correspondence from alumni (1986–2005) recalls happier experiences. These are reflected by the various publications in the collection: school guides, commencement programs, clippings from The Dutchman, the school's official newspaper, and Oxman's own The Rise and Fall, Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn, New York (self-published, 2017). Early twentieth-century postcards issued for the school's 125th anniversary, and photographs of its participation in the U.S. Bicentennial (1975-1976) and its own bicentennial celebrations (1987), round out the collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Harriet Morel Oxman (1927-2019) was a career educator who served the New York City school system from 1954 to 1982. A graduate of Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations and New York University's School of Education, Oxman was hired in 1957 to teach social studies at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, where she would rise to grade advisor, guidance counselor, assistant principal in 1964, and principal in 1972, a position she held for a decade. Oxman was the fifth and only female principal in the long history of Erasmus.

Erasmus Hall High School (899-925 Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, New York), descends from Erasmus Hall Academy, a private institution named for Dutch scholar and theologian Desiderius Erasmus (1466–1536). Erasmus Hall was founded in 1786 to educate the sons of the Dutch-speaking settlers of Flatbush, then an independent town of Kings County. It was the first secondary school to be chartered by the New York Board of Regents. The Academy building, constructed in 1787 in the Georgian and Federal styles, still stands and is an official New York City landmark. Flatbush was annexed by the City of Brooklyn in 1894, and Erasmus Hall was absorbed by the Brooklyn Board of Education. When Brooklyn joined Greater New York City in 1898, control of Erasmus Hall next went to the New York City Board of Education, which, between 1905 and 1940, constructed the current Collegiate Gothic buildings around the 1787 structure.

Harriet Oxman's tenure as principal (1972–1982) coincided with a period of decline in New York City's schools. Erasmus Hall, in the heart of then crime-ridden Flatbush, saw frequent violence and generally poor academic performance. In 1994, Erasmus was split internally in three separate schools: Humanities, Science and Mathematics, and Business and Technology. 2004 and 2006 saw the additions of the High School for Service and Learning and the Academy for Hospitality and Tourism.</field>
