    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes correspondence with architecture firm Delano &amp; Aldrich, developers Starrett Brothers, and others; specifications; leases; design samples; and other information pertinent to the development, construction, and decoration of the "new" 59-61 Wall Street building. The 1895 materials appear to have originated from the files of partner Howard Potter. The bulk of the records date from 1925-1929.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">By 1926, the land under Brown Brothers &amp; Co.'s New York headquarters at 59 Wall Street was owned by Wall &amp; Hanover Realty Co., which had been created to capitalize the property for the benefit of James Brown's heirs (see Subseries I.B. "Property" files).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Brown Brothers &amp; Co. sold the building (by selling the stock in Wall &amp; Hanover Realty Co.) to developer Starrett Brothers to build a new, larger structure to the firm's specifications, which opened in May, 1929. Brown Brothers &amp; Co., along with other tenants, became lessees of office space in the new building, and the firm brought with it paneling and other details from the original building. It occupied the basement, ground, first, mezzanine, and second floors of the new building. At the firm's behest, Starrett employed the architecture firm of Delano &amp; Aldrich (see Subseries V.C.i., Biographical Note, for an explanation of William Adams Delano's  relationship to the Brown family); 59 Wall Street was the architects' only skyscraper design.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The new building expanded on the previous property to include parts of the building at 61 Wall Street, but was oriented to retain the historical address and unique diagonal doorway design of the original structure. While construction on the new building was underway, Brown Brothers &amp; Co. leased space at 37 Wall Street previously occupied by the Equitable Trust Company.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These materials were housed separately from the "Property" files in Subseries I.B. Subject Files, and were marked as originating from partner Robert A. Lovett's files. A 1964 typed note with annotations in Kouwenhoven's hand indicates that they may have been destined to be included with the former materials. To retain their original provenance, they have been included here; researchers interested in the 59-61 Wall Street building and its history should consult materials in both series for more complete information on this subject.</field>
