    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries B. John Crosby Brown Papers (1859-1918)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes some of John Crosby Brown's transcribed letters, account books, as well as three journals and account books of his wife, Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The scrapbook of botanical specimens (Volume 36) includes pressed leaves and flowers, each identified with its name and location, from Brown's trip to Europe and the Middle East in 1859-1860. Two unmounted stereograph images in various exposures found loose in this volume have been removed to Subseries VIII.A. Assorted Visual Materials. The volume was donated to the Historical Files in 1966 by John Crosby Brown's grandson, John Crosby Brown Moore.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The letters in Volume 37 are typed transcripts, organized by the writer's last name and  bound with a table of contents and some photographs pasted in. It is annotated in pencil in John Kouwenhoven's hand, indicating in some places where the original of a transcribed letter can be found in the Historical Files. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volumes 38-40 show labels from a stationer in Liverpool, where Brown worked at Brown Shipley &amp; Co. before returning to join Brown Brothers &amp; Co. in New York as a partner in 1864. Inserted in Volume 40 is a note in Kouwenhoven's hand listing important references to be picked up from the volume's contents.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volumes 44 and 54 appear to be from the family's home Brighthurst, in Orange, New Jersey: they include expenditures for livestock and feed, as well as a gardener's wages.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volumes 45, 47, 48, 50, and 59 include details of Mrs. Adams' assets (including stocks and real estate holdings) and income, and show some of her expenditures for musical instruments in what would  be donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1899 as the Crosby Brown Collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">John Crosby Brown died in 1909; the notebooks that extend beyond that date show entries in a different hand.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">John Crosby Brown (1838-1909) became a partner of Brown Brothers &amp; Co. in New York in 1864, after having worked in the Liverpool offices of Brown Shipley &amp; Co. He had planned a career as a minister, but following the early deaths of his brothers James Alexander (killed, age 23, in a shooting accident) and William Benedict (drowned, age 29, aboard Arctic) he instead pursued a career in the family business. He served on the boards of many insurance companies and, like his father James Brown and father-in-law Dr. William Adams, was a lifelong supporter of Union Theological Seminary whose Adams Chapel he endowed with his wife Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown.</field>
