    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries C. Thatcher M. Brown Papers (1890-1966)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes correspondence and records to do with Thatcher Brown's extended family, including his executorship for various of their wills; business records from his lifelong work for Brown Brothers &amp; Co. and Brown Brothers Harriman; and personal financial records, including checkbooks and tax returns for him and his wife Caro Noyes Brown.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As well as serving as a senior member of Brown Brothers &amp; Co. and the first senior partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, Thatcher Brown was active in a variety of business and charitable organizations. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">He served on Union Theological Seminary's Board of Directors starting in 1908, and was its president from 1936 to 1947; and as director of Yale University's Alumni Fund and its chairman in 1919-1920. From 1907-1946 he was a member of Presbyterian Hospital's Board of Managers, for which in 1925 he chaired a campaign committee for the hospital's contributions to the $10 million fund for Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was also an elder of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among his corporate director- and trusteeships were Commercial Union Group, Prudential Insurance Company of London, Sun Insurance Company, Skandia Insurance Company of Stockholm, and Bank of Savings of New York. The precursor of Royal Insurance Company, The Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, held its first meeting in January 1851 in the offices of Brown Brothers &amp; Co., of which Thatcher Brown's grandfather James was a partner who served as a director of the insurance company. Thatcher Brown and his father, James Brown's son John Crosby Brown, likewise served as directors of the firm.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials were originally organized into personal correspondence, business correspondence, financial/tax documents, and a box of culled correspondence individually labeled in an unidentified hand. That order has been preserved, except where changes were necessary for clarity, with division into three subseries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries C.i. Personal and Family Materials includes personal correspondence of both Thatcher and Caro Noyes Brown, as well as to do with their apartment at 139 east 79th street, Thatcher Brown's estate work for family members including his wife Caro and his brother James Crosby Brown, club memberships, and charitable work for various institutions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries C.ii. Business Records includes records related to Thatcher Brown's nonfamily business interests, including estates work, and correspondence with Brown Brothers &amp; Co. and Brown Brothers Harriman. Financial records related only to Thatcher Brown's business interests are included here.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries C.iii. Financial Records includes personal checks and checkbooks of Thatcher and Caro Noyes Brown (mostly from accounts used to pay charitable contributions), tax preparation documents and returns, and financial records related to the estate and trusts under the will of Caro Noyes Brown.</field>
