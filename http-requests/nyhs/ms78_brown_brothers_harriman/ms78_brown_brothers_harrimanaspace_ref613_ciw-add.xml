    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series V. Partners' Papers (1859-1966)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes material generated by five Brown Brothers partners who were also interrelated (see Biographical Note). Some of these individuals are also represented in Subseries I.C.vi. Partners.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">James Brown and Robert A. Lovett's materials in this series are exclusively business-related; material from the other partners in this series documents mostly personal and some business-related activities. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">John Crosby Brown (1838-1909) was the son of Brown Brothers &amp; Co. founder and partner James Brown (1791-1877). Among John Crosby Brown's six children was partner Thatcher M. Brown (1876-1954).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">James Brown (1863-1935) was the son of George Hunter Brown (1835-1900), the older brother of John Crosby Brown. James Brown's daughter, Adele Quartley Brown (1899-1986), married Robert A. Lovett (1895-1986) in 1919. James Brown was John Crosby Brown's nephew and a cousin of both Moreau Delano and Thatcher M. Brown.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">John Crosby Brown's wife, Mary Elizabeth Adams Brown (1842-1918), was the sister of Sarah Magoun Adams (b. 1847), who married Brown Brothers partner Eugene Delano (1844-1920) in 1872. Their son, partner Moreau Delano (1877-1936), was therefore a nephew of John Crosby Brown and a first cousin of Thatcher M. Brown.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series is arranged in four subseries in alphabetical order by partners' names. Some of the items were marked with Kouwenhoven's People or Subject designations but are included in this series to be grouped with other similar materials. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The James Brown and Robert A. Lovett diaries were originally housed in ring binders. Materials have been removed and foldered in acid-free boxes: any relevant information from the binders was photocopied onto acid-free paper and precedes the material it describes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Robert A. Lovett's 1947-1949 diary is available on microfilm and will be presented in that format.</field>
