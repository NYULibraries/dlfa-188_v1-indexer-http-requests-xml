    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of individual narrative and tabular descriptions from Brown Brothers' various departments detailing their progress and shortcomings over the previous year. The first report, submitted to the Executive Committee in 1897 by James Brown, he characterized as "somewhat of an experiment." Beginning in 1900, the reports were submitted by individual departments' managers and compiled for presentation.  Some are annotated in pencil by partner Thatcher M. Brown and others by an unidentified hand. They end in 1930, the year before Brown Brothers merged with the Harriman interests. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 1912 report includes memoranda for its preparation: notes, calculations, adding machine tape. A note on the 1914 report reads "Mr. T. M. Brown would like some more convenient way of putting the various reports together." The 1926 report has a cover letter addressed to "Mr. Lovett": probably partner Robert A. Lovett.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each report provides a snapshot of contemporary business practices as reflected in  staffing decisions and expenditures; areas identified for improvement; levels of  funding for a variety of activities; and contact with overseas branches, correspondent banks, and customers. They provide internal documentation, at the departmental level, of financial transactions, trends, and decisions reflected in Series III. Financial and Business Records and Series IV. Business Transaction Records.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Because the firm was a partnership, the Annual Reports are private and confidential, not the published documents required for a publicly held company answerable to shareholders. The Statements of Condition, however, were both printed and submitted to newspapers and summarize the firm's assets and liabilities. These include final printed versions, newspaper clippings from the scrapbooks of Miss Catherine Barrett (see Series VI. Scrapbooks and Collected Material), and annotated working versions showing required changes. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Statements of Condition were donated to the Historical Files Library by Deputy Manager Clarence F. von Glahn in 1969.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Annual Reports are arranged chronologically, followed by the Statements of Condition in chronological order. The latter were originally housed individually by year in annotated folders. Information from the folders has been photocopied onto acid-free paper and precedes the materials described.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Two copies each of two advertisements that were the first Brown Brothers Harriman had ever placed in newspapers, which were included with these materials, have been  moved to Series VII. Promotional and Press Material.</field>
