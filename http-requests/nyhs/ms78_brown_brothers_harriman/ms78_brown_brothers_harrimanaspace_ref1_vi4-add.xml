    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes original, photocopied, and secondary materials consisting of correspondence, photographs, ledgers, account books, clippings, and brochures. They document many aspects of the founding, management, and evolution of Brown Brothers Harriman and its constituent preceding organizations including Brown Brothers &amp; Co., Brown Shipley &amp; Co., and W.A. Harriman &amp; Co., as well as biographical information about partners, staff members, and other relevant individuals. They also include records of all aspects of the preparation, publication, and publicity for Partners in Banking. Because the Files were specifically compiled as research for this book, they form a consciously chosen, or artificial, collection rather than a true archive of the companies' naturally occurring records over time. Material continued to be added to the Historical Files sporadically until 1975.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As well as documenting the company's history, the Files provide details about the business processes of financial firms over a period of 200 years, including changes in long-distance communications, financial instruments, image creation and distribution, and staffing decisions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Because the Historical Files were compiled as an aid to research, they include significant repetition and overlap of materials. For example, Subseries D. Historical Files Director's Files, complements information on the firm's 150th anniversary celebrations also documented in the 1968 files of Subseries A. Chronological Files, and the "150th anniversary" and "Sesquicentennial" files in Subseries B. Subject Files. There is extensive and detailed cross-referencing of documents in Subseries I.A. Chronological, I.B. Subjects, and I.C. People, documented in the "cross-reference sheets" in each of those. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographic prints in this series include those reproduced in Partners in Banking, sometimes with their accompanying negatives. These provide information on sources, permissions, and the images' placement in the book's final layout. Many are not original to the collection but were sourced from other places for use in the book.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included with the Records, and available for researchers' use in the Reading Room,  is an index to the Historical Files compiled by Kouwenhoven and  Brown, in the form of a six-drawer card catalog organized into two sections: one alphabetical and one chronological. Its level of detail and cross-referencing is greater than the container lists below and complements the word-searchable capabilities of this Finding Aid.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In compiling the Historical Files, Kouwenhoven and Brown consulted existing published and archival records, visited Brown ancestral properties and company facilities, and interviewed current and past Brown Brothers Harriman partners, managers, and employees. From these many sources they accessioned original material, photocopies, and transcripts to add to the Historical Files based on the information's usefulness to the research and writing of the company's history. Original material was not necessarily preferred over secondary versions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Historical Files were arranged by Kouwenhoven in three series (Chronological Files, Subject Files, People Files), which form Subseries I.A., I.B., and I.C, respectively. These have been rehoused from their original storage in five three-drawer filing cabinets. Subseries I.D. Historical Files Director's Files contains materials found separately in the Records relating to the formation and running of the Historical Files, including making and answering research requests; and the preparation, publication, and promotion of Partners in Banking. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series was originally housed in oversized cardboard folders containing items often in individual folders or envelopes that were heavily annotated on the outside. (Some samples are included at the end of Subseries I.D.) Information available only on the annotations has been photocopied onto acid-free paper and precedes the original item in the files. Users are advised to consult the card catalog in the repository for cross-references to these annotations, since this detailed, item-level information is not reflected in the container list. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials found elsewhere in the collection that were marked for inclusion in the Historical Files but were not yet filed there have been added as appropriate: a notebook of information about guests from Switzerland and the United Kingdom attending the Pacific Northwest 150th anniversary festivities is now included in the "1968" section of the Chronological files (Subseries I.A). Boston office forms, Brown Brothers &amp; Co. correspondence, Tax Department files, and co-partnership records have been added to the Subject files (Subseries I.B.). Clippings about the activities of partner and sometime State Department appointee Robert A. Lovett are now included in the Partners files (Subseries I.C.vi.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The dates on folders denote the period for which the material would be relevant to the writing of Partners in Banking, not the date of the material's creation or receipt, which may have been decades or centuries later. For example, information on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1831 is filed under that date, even though the document itself is dated 1966. Original order has been retained within folders; some materials are now housed in separate oversized (OS) boxes of various sizes, noted in the container lists. Material in the OS boxes is listed here chronologically; there is variation in box numbers within that listing based on the various sizes of oversized materials.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Volumes 1-12 were originally foldered in the Historical Files; they have been removed and are described together at the end of their respective subseries. </field>
