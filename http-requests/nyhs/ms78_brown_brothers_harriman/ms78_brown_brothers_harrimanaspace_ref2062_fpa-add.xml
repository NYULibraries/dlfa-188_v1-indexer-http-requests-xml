    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The mounted prints were prepared for Kouwenhoven as aids to editing Evans's portfolio for publication in Partners in Banking. A sample card provided by Evans, with a handwritten and signed explanation, appears to be the prototype. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each mount is stamped with the Historical Files' stamp and dated. Many are accompanied by separate captions in Sarah B. Brown's hand (some edited in another hand); photocopies of her originals; and/or typed captions on adhesive-backed paper, some adhered to the mount and some loose. Some of the Philadelphia office photographs are captioned on the back in pencil, in Evans's hand. Images used in the book ("P.I.B") are marked on the back with their respective page numbers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">His biographer, Jeff Rosenheim, has described Evans's business-environment photographs as documenting "the office as cultural artifact." These images of wealthy and powerful men, in their work and home environments and with the tools and possessions that define them, can easily be compared with Evans's images of farmers and migrant workers who are likewise defined by their bereft environment and paltry possessions. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials were originally stored in three large record center cartons. They have been rehoused in acid-free folders in archival document boxes. The accompanying captions, originally paper-clipped to the mounted prints, have been preservation photocopied and precede the prints that they describe. The prints are ordered as they were in the original boxes, using the descriptions on the dividers that identified groups of images. There is significant repetition of images in some of the groups. The numbering of these boxes is out of order because of their different sizes.</field>
