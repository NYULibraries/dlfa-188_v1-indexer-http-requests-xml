    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series VII. Promotional and Press Material (1944-1993)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes materials providing publicity about the firm and its partners and produced for public distribution; articles mentioning Brown Brothers Harriman or its employees' and partners' activities inside and outside the firm; and two copies of "The Fifty-Niner," published during World World II for employees in the armed services to keep them apprised of activities and news in the New York office.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials produced by the firm marked its 150th and 175th anniversaries. Because it remains a partnership rather than a corporation with public reporting requirements, the firm has not consistently produced annual reports or other corporate publications for public consumption.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The items in this series appear to have been collected from various sources for use by the Historical Files, but were not included with other promotional materials found in Subseries I.A. Chronological Files or Subseries I.B. Subject Files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The three copies of the New York Times containing  society columnist Charlotte Curtis's article on the 150th anniversary party are extremely brittle and difficult to handle. Reproductions of the article are available in the "1968" folders of Subseries I.A. Chronological Files, and in the "Sesquicentennial" folders of Subseries I.B. Subject Files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 1968 newspaper ads were found with the annual reports in Series II. Annual Reports and Statements of Condition and were moved here for consistency.</field>
