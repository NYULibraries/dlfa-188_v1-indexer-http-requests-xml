    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The diaries document the range of contacts Brown had with other bankers (including J.P. Morgan partner Edward Stettinius), business executives, and elected officials during the 1910s and 1920s, through negotiations and loans in Nicaragua, the course of World War I and postwar financing and reconstruction in Europe, and the 1920s economic boom. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 1917-1919 diary ends with list of "prominent personages met by Mr. James Brown during 1919," detailing treasury and finance officials of European and North and South American businesses and governments whom he met while traveling to Paris, Belgium, Germany, Spain, and London.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The early 1920s entries include frequent references to the Mercantile Bank of the Americas, which was chartered in Connecticut to carry on banking activities outside the United States including in Nicaragua; and to meetings with government officials and journalists regarding the Congressional inquiry into the Nicaraguan loans.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 1929 diary begins in April, after Brown had spent the first months of the year in Florida.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">James Brown (1863-1935) was senior partner of Brown Brothers &amp; Co. when it negotiated  a loan to the Republic of Nicaragua in 1912, at the request of the United States government. The objective was to effect currency reform, overhaul the Pacific Railway, and establish a national bank, of which Brown served as president from 1912 to 1914. Congress later opened inquiries into the loans and their dissemination as part of a general review of so-called Dollar Diplomacy. He was instrumental in arranging the first dollar (rather than sterling) denominated commercial export syndicate credits through the Bank of France in 1915. During World War I he represented American bankers at negotiations with European governments regarding wartime financing, conferring with Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George,  Bank of England governor Lord Cunliffe, and representatives of European banking concerns.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 1910 to 1917 diaries are handwritten (some in pencil that is difficult to decipher), interspersed with typed minutes and proceedings from meetings of Brown Brothers &amp; Co.'s Policy Committee until 1912, and paginated to page 68. A note in the diary after this page in Brown's hand reads "In November 1913 there being but three active partners it was decided to meet every day at 10.30 - in other words to resume the Policy Committee meetings that had fallen into disuse since Mr. Duanes death [in 1912]./ I began the practice of noting the subjects discussed without attempting to record the discussion in detail."  These entries were indexed by Patricia Hoban for the Historical Files, by page number through 1913 and by date for the unpaginated entries through 1917.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The succeeding diaries are typewritten, paginated consecutively from year to year, and indexed; the index precedes each diary as it did in the original ring binders.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"Odd notes from J.B's diaries" is in an unidentified hand and was found with the original binders; it has been added preceding the run of diaries.</field>
