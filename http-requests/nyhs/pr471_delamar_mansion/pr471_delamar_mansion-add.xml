    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Following one exterior view, the other twenty-seven photographs in this collection depict the various interiors of the Joseph Raphael De Lamar House at 233 Madison Avenue, designed in the Beaux-Arts style by "mansion architect" C. P. H. Gilbert and constructed in 1902–1905. A supplemental imprint sheet indicates the photographs were taken by "DE W. C. WARD" of New York. This was DeWitt Clinton Ward (d. 1933), noted photographer of the work of famous artists and sculptors. Ward likely took these views of the De Lamar Mansion shortly after its completion in 1905, and definitely before the sale of its contents in 1919.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While none of the photographs are identified, they depict the mansion's entrance vestibule, staircase, gallery, library, ballroom, dining room, breakfast rooms, and assorted bedrooms with their adjacent sitting rooms. A few photographs highlight individual furnishings that were also depicted in the Illustrated catalogue of the extremely costly furnishings, embellishments and interior decorations of the residence of the late Captain J.R. De Lamar, No. 233 Madison Avenue, New York City (1919), such as the "French inlaid kingwood and cuivre doré bed in the Louis XV style" (second sale, no. 376), the "Richly carved and gilded Vernis Martin grand piano in the Louis XV style by Steinway &amp; Sons" (second sale, no. 475), and the "Grand salon vitrine in the Louis XV style by Linke" (second sale, no. 485).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dutch-born financier Joseph Raphael De Lamar (1843–1918) made his primary fortune from mines he owned in Canada and the American west. He amassed an estate valued at $32 million (upwards of $700 million today). In 1902 he purchased for $250,000 a plot on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and East 37th Street, in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan, and commissioned "mansion architect" C. P. H. Gilbert (1861–1952) to design there a house costing $500,000. The house, with an address of 233 Madsion Avenue, was completed in 1905. As befitted De Lamar's wealth, it contained lavishly decorated interiors spread out over six floors, as well as a rooftop dog run and a basement garage accessed by an elevator that raised and lowered vehicles from the street. De Lamar occupied his mansion for little more than a decade: he died in 1918. He bequeathed one third of his estate to his sole child, Alice (1895–1983). Her share did not include 233 Madison Avenue, which she vacated soon after her father's death. The remainder of De Lamar's estate went to the medical schools of Harvard, Columbia, and Johns Hopkins. In 1923 the schools sold the house to the National Democratic Club. In 1973 it was purchased by the Polish government, and since then has housed the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in New York. The house was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1975.</field>
