    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes an almost complete set of minutes of Board of Directors meetings (generally held monthly) from December, 1917 through 1979; there are no minutes for 1930 through March, 1931, or for the years 1970-1972. The minutes contain discussions of the current business of the TAS (including financial statements), reports of various committees, and descriptions of casework and efforts to adapt to changing social conditions and travelers needs. These transcripts also provide details about the death of Board members and employees, issues at the various ports and stations, relations with the national organization, staffing issues, publicity and fundraising efforts, and particulars regarding the purchase and maintenance of TAS offices and guesthouse properties. Also included are minutes of meetings of the Travelers Aid Society of Northern New Jersey, which was taken over by the Travelers Aid Society of New York in 1965. Researchers should note that these minutes, though removed from their original binders, have been organized into folders in their original order (often reverse chronological order). An example of the original binders has been retained.</field>
