    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Because most members of the Williams family were active participants in the French and Indian War, military documents make up a significant portion of this collection. Box 1, Folder 9, for example, contains 57 enlistment papers from March and April of 1756, all slated for the Crown Point expedition. Mentioned among the leadership of the expedition are Thomas Williams, Elijah Williams, William Williams and Joseph Dwight. The enlistment papers are in good condition and have been arranged in alphabetic order by last name of enlistee.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In Box 1, Folder 10 are more materials from the Crown Point action. They include items such as Thomas Williams' commission as Lt. Col. and Captain of "a Regiment of Foot" in the British army of Massachusetts Bay province, dated September 9, 1755. Also contained in the folder are troop rosters, muster rolls, pay receipts, calculation sheets, lists of accounts and a variety of notes. The items are arranged in chronological order. Many are not dated; they have been placed last in the folder.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Military papers in Box 1, Folder 12 include such items as pay documents for the troops of Capt. Ephraim Williams (1749-1750); a list of sick and wounded (October 12, 1755); a list of "articles of plunder" (October 14, 1755); and a copy of Montcalm's Articles of Capitulation, allowing for the retreat of Monroe's troops and their dependents from Fort William Henry to Fort Edward (September 9, 1757). Items are arranged chronologically.</field>
