    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV is composed of wills and related estate papers. In Box 1, Folder 15 are an unsigned version and a copy of the will of Col. Ephraim Williams written on July 22, 1755, as he awaited major military action. He died less than two months later, on September 8. After bequests to members of his family, he left the remainder of his estate to support and maintain "a free school in the township west of Fort Massachusetts." This area later became Williamstown and the school, Williams College.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other wills, those of Thomas Williams and William Williams, are contained in Box 1, Folder 16, along with estate inventory lists, an official appointment by the probate judge to inventory Thomas Williams' estate, and a transfer of land out of Thomas Williams' estate by Esther Williams.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hinsdale family estate documents are found in Box 1, Folder 17. They primarily involve two sons of Mehuman Hinsdale (1673-1736) and his wife, Mary (1680-1763). The sons, John Hinsdale (1713-1746) and Ebenezer Hinsdale (1706-1763), both had significant estates and, since John's death preceded Ebenezer's, portions of John's estate became involved in the estate of Ebenezer. The Hinsdale and Williams families were joined through the marriage of Ebenezer to Abigail Williams, daughter of Rev. John Williams (1664-1729). Another family member whose estate is included in this series is Abigail Norton (1745-1806), daughter of John Hinsdale and a favorite niece of Abigail Williams Hinsdale.</field>
