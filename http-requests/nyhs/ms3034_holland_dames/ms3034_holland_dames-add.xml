    <field name="abstract_teim">Records of the still-active Society of Daughters of Holland Dames, Descendants of the Ancient and Honorable Families of New Netherland, a lineage organization open to qualified women who descend from Dutch settlers present in New Netherlands 1674 and earlier. The Daughters of Holland Dames' objectives are to perpetuate the memory and promote the virtues of the Dutch settlers by collecting and preserving historical and genealogical documents, encouraging historical research and erecting durable memorials in lasting tribute to the early Dutch settlers. Examples are: stained glass windows to Peter Stuyvesant at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery (1903), and to Henry Hudson at the New-York Historical Society (1908). Includes board minutes, financial records, correspondence, ephemera, and membership applications.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames, Descendants of the Ancient and Honorable Families of New Netherland span from 1895, the year of the organization's founding, through 2019. Within the Society, each officer kept her own records, and reported the activities in her purview monthly or annually. As a result, and because the Society's records were never maintained in a central location, there are decided gaps in coverage. Despite this, the minutes of board and annual meetings provide the best documentation of the DHD's activities and projects, some of which are further detailed in dedicated folders. See, for instance, the papers generated by the 1903 installation of a stained glass window to Peter Stuyvesant in St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery (box 9, folder 18), or the memorial to Society's communal Dutch ancestors proposed for Battery Park, and the ensuing litigation brought by its designer, sculptor Robert Aitken, who sued for payment (box 8, folder 12).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes applications for membership in the DHD, which document the lineage of each member back to her qualifying ancestor(s). Supplemental applications provide similar information for additional ancestors from whom members descend. Restrictions apply to this portion of the collection; see the note at "Subseries IV.B. Membership Applications and Genealogical Proofs, 1895-2019," in the container list, below.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Society of Daughters of Holland Dames, Descendants of the Ancient and Honorable Families of New Netherland (DHD), was organized on 8 May 1895 and incorporated 9 December 1895 "to perpetuate the memory and promote the principles and virtues of the Dutch ancestors of its members" by collecting and preserving "genealogical and historical documents relating to the Dutch in America," encouraging "excellence in historical research," and establishing "commemorative and durable memorials in lasting tribute to the early Dutch settlers." Similar in aim to the males-only Holland Society of New York (established 1885), the DHD is open solely to women over the age of eighteen who can prove descent from an ancestor, male or female, who was born in the Netherlands or New Netherland prior to the 1674 Treaty of Westminster (when the Dutch ceded control of the region to the English), or whose ancestor resided in New Netherland prior to the Treaty of Westminster, or whose ancestor held some official capacity in New Netherland (e.g., a Director General; a member of the Director General's council; a member of a governmental or religious body; a patroon or freeholder; a commissioner of Indian Affairs, boundaries, or treaties; or a commissioned officer, soldier, or sailor who served in defense of New Netherland).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In fulfillment of its goals the DHD has placed Dutch-specific monuments around New York City, most notably at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery, where a stained glass window to Peter Stuyvesant (1610-1672), last Director General of New Netherland, was installed above his burial vault in 1903, and at the New-York Historical Society, where a stained glass window entitled "Memorial to Henry Hudson: The Arrival of the Halve Maen, 1609," was installed in the library in 1908. (The DHD later funded the restoration of both windows.)</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">From 1915 through the 1990s the DHD provided partial scholarships to American college students of Dutch ancestry. They have supported Dutch historic sites in New York City, such as the 18th-century Hendrick I. Lott House in Marine Park, Brooklyn, and the Brinckerhoff Cemetery, a colonial-era burial ground in Fresh Meadows, Queens. The DHD has hosted visits of the Dutch royal family (by tradition its female members have been honorary Holland Dames), and participated in anniversary celebrations, such as the 2009 Henry Hudson Quadricentennial/NY400, in recognition of their Dutch ancestors.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Society of Daughters of Holland Dames, Descendants of the Ancient and Honorable Families of New Netherland governing board is headed by its Directress General. The following women have held that position through 2020 (their membership numbers appear after their names):</field>
