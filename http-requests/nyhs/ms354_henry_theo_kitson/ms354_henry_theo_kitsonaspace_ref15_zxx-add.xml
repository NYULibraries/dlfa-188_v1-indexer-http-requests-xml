    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series 1: Correspondence, 1892-1934</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes letters to, and from, Henry or Theo Kitson, as well as letters between other correspondents.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence received by Henry Kitson is arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent, then chronologically. Correspondents with five or more letters in the collection have a folder of their own. The correspondence received by Theo Kitson is foldered separately from the letters received by Henry Kitson. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For the most part, envelopes are housed with their enclosed letters. Bulky envelopes were removed to the Envelopes folder, and either a photocopy of the envelope or a separation sheet was inserted in its stead. Envelopes for which no corresponding letter could be determined were placed in the Envelopes folder. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The letters to Henry Kitson are primarily from individuals and organizations who commissioned work from him. These letters often contain commentary by the correspondents regarding the pace of work and their level of satisfaction, as well as their specifications or suggestions for the works-in-progress. Certain correspondents are found much more frequently than others in the collection and, therefore, the related subject projects are more strongly represented. Among these correspondents are Blewett Lee (re: the Lt. Gen. Lee memorial), Thomas Bradley (re: the H Company sculpture), L. L. Conant, Wendell Endicott, and officers of the National Society of New England Women (re: the Pilgrim Maiden statue). Also in this series is considerable correspondence with Mead, Mason &amp; Co. (re: the Iowa Memorial), Roman Bronze Works and other providers of materials and services for Kitson's projects. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is little correspondence in the collection from the Kitsons, numbering only five pieces, all of which appear to be written by Henry Kitson. These are foldered separately from correspondence received. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also included are a few items between people other than the Kitsons (a librarian, a merchant) that are related to sculptures and memorials, and letters to unidentified recipients. Two pieces of correspondence are in French. </field>
