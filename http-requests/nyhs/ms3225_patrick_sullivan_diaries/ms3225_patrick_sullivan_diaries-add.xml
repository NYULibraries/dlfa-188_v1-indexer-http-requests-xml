    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of small bound volumes used as diaries by Patrick Joseph Sullivan (1874-1944). Sullivan, the son of Irish immigrants, worked as a fuel inspector for the New York City Department of Education in the early 20th century, and lived in Corona, Queens with his wife and their 9 children. Diary entries begin on February 24, 1905, and end on February 23, 1944, the date of his death. In brief daily entries, Sullivan records the bare facts of his activities at work and at home.  At the beginning and end of many of the diaries are records of household accounts, as well as phone numbers of co-workers, relatives and friends.</field>
