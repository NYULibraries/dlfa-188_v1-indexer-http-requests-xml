    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Wooden plank (measuring 99 inches long by 8 inches wide by 1 inch thick) inscribed "SUPREME COURT—STATE OF NEW YORK PART 81" and signed by the participants in the trial of the People v. Bernhard Goetz, including the defendant. Accompanied by the following description:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">========================================</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This is the actual remnant of the jury box in the courtroom at 111 Centre Street where the trial of People v Bernhard Goetz transpired. The jury box as originally constructed was too tall to permit the jurors to see exhibits displayed in the well of the court. As the trial proceeded this became evident (Transcript p. 5053). As a result, the clerk of the part, Robert Hamkalo, arranged with the New York City Department of General Services, as it then was called, to cut down the jury box overnight. He sought this unprecedented cooperation by informing the representatives of DGS that Judge Crane would praise the Department to the world press assembled in the courtroom if they accomplished this task; but if not the judge would have to inform the audience of the reason why the jury box continued to obstruct the view of the jurors. The next morning, May 1, 1987, a sign on the diminished jury box read "Don't Touch. Varnish Wet." Judge Crane, off the record, made the promised remarks to the audience and later, on the record (Transcript p. 5293–4) congratulated Bob Hamkalo and told the jurors that the diminished jury box should "enhance your abilities to discharge your obligations as the trial continues in being able to see the exhibits that are produced in the well of the court…and to be able to see the witnesses as they are on the witness stand." Following the day's proceedings, the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge for the Courts Within the City of New York, Milton Williams, called Judge Crane to ask how he accomplished the down-sizing of the jury box because he, Judge Williams, had been requesting this remedy for all the jury boxes at 111 Centre Street for the past 7 years!</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">It was also the idea of the clerk of the part to obtain the signatures of all the participants in the trial on each of the three boards that formed the excess height of the jury box. On the left in the positions in which they sat appear the signatures of the jurors: #1 James Hurley, Foreman; #2 Erniece Dix; #3 Catherine Brody; #4 D. Wirth Jackson; #5 Mark Lesly (who later wrote a book about the trial Subway Gunman: A Juror's Account of the Bernhard Goetz Trial with Charles Shuttleworth); #6 James P. Moseley; #7 Lyn (Carolyn) Perlmuth; #8 Diane Serpe; #9 Rober Leach; #10 Francisco Figuera; #11 Michael Axelrod; #12 Ralph Schreimpf; Alternate #1 Jon Patten; Alternate #2 Delphine McFadden; Alternate #3 Lou Mari Vereen; and Alternate #4 Augustine Ayala.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also signing: Justice Stephen G. Crane; Law Secretary, Leon Schechter; Court Clerk Robert Hamkalo; Assistant District Attorney Gregory Waples; Defense Team, Barry Slotnick; Mark M. Baker; Frank King; Gillian Coulter; and Bernhard Goetz; Court Officers Jim Lawler; Dan Dolger; Clifton Murphy; Stephen Cazilas; and Artie Coardes; and Court Reporters Stephen Cohen; Joel Machlis; Nina Koss; and Hilda J. Wall.</field>
