    <field name="abstract_teim">Trial docket books (1981–2000) and clipping and subject files (1982–1991) of New York Criminal Court and Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Crane, who presided over the sensational trial of Bernhard Goetz, the so-called "Subway Vigilante." Goetz, a white electronics engineer, shot four African American youths who asked him for money aboard the No. 2 train on December 22, 1984. He was acquitted of attempted murder, but found guilty only of illegal possession of a handgun. The collection includes a 9,505-page transcript of the proceedings of The People of the State of New York v. Bernhard Goetz (1986–1987), plus two artifacts signed by the trial participants—the judge, jurors, attorneys, court officers and reporters, and the defendant himself.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Aside from the trial docket books in Series I, which record proceedings heard by Justice Stephen G. Crane in the Criminal Court of the City of New York (1981–1983) and New York State Supreme Court (1984–2000), the bulk of this collection centers on the criminal trial of "Subway Vigilante" Bernhard Goetz (1985–1987). Series II includes subject files on various aspects of The People v. Goetz, containing such material as handwritten notes, photocopies of laws and precedents, court documents, and scattered correspondence. More focused correspondence—much of it from interested members of the public who offered Crane their opinions both for and against Goetz (in sometimes racially-tinged language)—may be found in Box 6, Folders 1–8. And extensive newspaper clippings on the Goetz case, trial, and sentencing, may be found in Box 5, Folders 8–47. A copy of the official 9,505-page trial transcript fills three record cartons and provides minute coverage of the proceedings; see Box 8, Folder 1 for a detailed table of contents and an index to witness testimony. The collection also includes two unusual, autographed mementos of the Goetz trial (see Series IV). One, a 108-inch-long computer printout, presents the jury's admonition or oath with an inscription "To Justice Stephen G. Crane with respect and admiration" and signatures of the jurors and alternates. The other, a remnant of the jury box from the courtroom at 111 Centre Street, Manhattan, where the Goetz trial took place, is a 99-inch-long wooden plank signed by all the participants (excluding the victims): the judge, the jurors, their alternates, the attorneys, court officers and reporters, and the defendant, Bernhard Goetz, himself. See the note at Series IV for a description of this item's creation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Cornell Law School graduate Stephen G. Crane (J.D., 1963) practiced law in New York City from 1963 until 1981, when he became a Judge for the Criminal Court of the City of New York. Crane was appointed Acting State Supreme Court Justice in 1984, and served in that position through 1989, during which time he presided over the controversial trial of so-called "Subway Vigilante" Bernhard H. Goetz. Crane became a Supreme Court Justice in 1990, and served as Administrative Judge of Supreme Court, Civil Branch for New York County from 1996 until 2001. That year, he was designated an Additional Justice for the Appellate Division, Second Department, and in 2005 was officially designated as an Associate Justice for that Court. He was promoted to Senior Associate Justice for the Appellate Division, Second Department in 2008, the year he retired.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On December 22, 1984, Bernhard Goetz, a white, 37-year-old electronics engineer riding the No. 2 subway, shot four African American youths—Barry Allen, Troy Canty, Darrell Cabey, and James Ramseur—who asked him for money. Goetz was indicted for attempted murder, and his subsequent trial brought intense debate to the subjects of self-defense and public safety. Some members of the public painted the shooter as a hero fighting the dangers of urban crime. Others viewed him as a depraved vigilante whose excessive force was racially motivated. Although Darrell Cabey was left paralyzed and brain-damaged by the shooting, Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder, and found guilty only of illegal possession of a handgun. He was sentenced to a year in prison (he served eight months at Riker's Island) and five years' probation.</field>
