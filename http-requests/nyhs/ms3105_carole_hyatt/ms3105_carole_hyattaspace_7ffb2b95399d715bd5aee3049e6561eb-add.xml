    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes approximately 670 audiocassette tapes, 457 of which have been digitized for access. None of the tapes were listened to during processing but the overall subject content is clear from the tape labels and overall collection context. The bulk of the tapes are of interviews that Carole Hyatt conducted in the 1980s and 1990s during her research for her books, both those realized and those contemplated but not realized or realized in a different form than originally planned. Most of these interviews were with individuals, but also included focus groups of men and/or women, couples, business partners, or other combinations. The bulk, reflecting the experiences of regular people, are with relatively unknown individuals, but some notable figures appear, such as newscaster Walter Cronkite, author William Shirer, boxer Gerry Cooney, former U.S. senator George McGovern, Vice-Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, entrepreneur and founder of Famous Amos cookies Wally Amos, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and New York University president and former Congressman John Brademas. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Generally, the tapes are well-labeled as to the name of the interviewee, but often lack a date or identification as to which project they pertain to. Indexes found in Series II (folder title "Miscellaneous Lists and Notes about Tapes," Box 9, folder 20) can provide guidance as to the context of some of the tapes and were used by the processing archivist in developing notes in the container list.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The tapes also include recordings of Hyatt appearances on radio and television talk shows, remarks at presentations and conferences,  and, judging from the labels, her dictation of book outlines and chapters (possibly "Shifting Gears" specifically). Other tapes include recordings made by Hyatt of talks given by others on topics of interest, as well as commercially produced tapes on time management, motivational techniques, and other topics of use to Hyatt in her research.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In 2016, 457 of the audiotapes were digitized for accessibility and use. These were chosen more or less randomly so there is no overall difference between the content of the digitized and non-digitized tapes. Different access restrictions apply to both and are further described at the subseries level.</field>
