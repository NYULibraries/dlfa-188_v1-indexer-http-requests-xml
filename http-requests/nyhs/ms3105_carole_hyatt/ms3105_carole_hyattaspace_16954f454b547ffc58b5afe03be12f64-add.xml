    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes Carole Hyatt's files concerning her various initiatives, both proposed and realized. The subseries includes the proposals for at least two of Hyatt's published books ("When Smart People Fail" and "Lifetime Employability"), along with book projects that did not come to fruition. There are interview logs and interview release forms and a few interview notes mixed into the files, but generally the interview transcripts and notes are found in subseries II.A. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Beyond Hyatt's books, the subseries holds files with Hyatt's remarks for workshops, panels, and the like; proposed partnerships with corporations and with other consultants; various notes and reference material informing her work; and two of Hyatt's reports from the mid-1970s during her years at her firm, Child Research Service. There is a rich set of files on her Japan-based initiatives, circa 1990, that she executed with Noriko Sakayori. And a set of files with proposals for television shows and segments, especially for a situation comedy (sitcom) to be named "Shirley." </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Because the content varies considerably among the topics represented in the subseries,the container list provides more detail on content, including identifying where a few interview notes can be found.</field>
