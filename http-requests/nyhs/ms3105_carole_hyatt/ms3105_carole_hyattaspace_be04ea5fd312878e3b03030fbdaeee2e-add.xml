    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries includes files of documents related to interviews conducted in the course of Hyatt's research for books published or for potential books and other initiatives. The files hold transcripts of the taped interviews or handwritten notes from the interview or both. Some files hold the cassette tape of the interview; those are noted in the container list. For the most, though, the related tapes were held apart from the document files and are found in Series III.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Especially well-represented in this subseries are transcripts related to two of Hyatt's books "When Smart People Fail" (1987) and "Shifting Gears" (1990). Related material in the subseries that did not explicitly lead to a book but are concerned with the workplace of the late twentieth century, men and women's relation to the workplace, and the shifting notions of personal success are interviews on the themes of "corporate survivors," acquiring wisdom, and handling success. The evolving role of women in society is considered in interviews on the topic of winning (i.e., successful) couples and the impact on women of gaining financial power as they enter the workforce.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A note on names: The form and spelling of names in the container list was taken from the documents. However, it is clear that variant forms and spellings of many of the names can be found in the overall collection, specifically between the transcripts and working documents (Series II) and the audiotape labels (Series III). The processing archivist noted some of these variant names, but surely not all, nor was any attempt made to reconcile them or determine a single "correct" name to use. Accordingly, users should keep in mind the potential for name variants and be cautious in relying exclusively on keyword searches.</field>
