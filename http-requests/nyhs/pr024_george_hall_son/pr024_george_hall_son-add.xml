    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The George P. Hall &amp; Son Photograph Collection spans the period from 1876 through 1914 and consists of vintage glass negatives, vintage photographic logbooks, and modern photographic contact prints printed from 1965 to 1975 from Hall &amp; Son's original oversize glass negatives. The collection is arranged into six series: Photographs of Manhattan; Photographs of Brooklyn, The Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island; Photographs Outside New York City; Photographs by Subject; Negatives; and Logbooks. Within each photographic subseries, photographs are divided into unmounted and mounted to accommodate preservation needs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The large-format views in this collection provide clear, extremely detailed and flattering depictions of a variety of subjects, including Manhattan's early skyscrapers, hotels and theater exteriors, harbor activity, and downtown streets, as well as Brooklyn's business areas and resorts. George P. Hall &amp; Son photographed the Battery skyline repeatedly from the 1880s to the 1910s, documenting the dramatic changes that occurred as New York progressed from a lowrise to a highrise city. Many of Hall &amp; Son's views are notable for their high-angle perspectives. Like many commercial photographers of the time, Hall &amp; Son focused on the highlights of New York; the newest skyscrapers, the record-breaking bridges, and the most popular theaters and attractions. Views in this collection also depict many of the United States Navy's new steel battleships of the 1890s. Also included are some views of the Hall's business premises and family members. Hall &amp; Son primarily documented building exteriors; when interior views are available, this has been noted in the finding aid.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographic prints in this collection were made between 1965 and 1975 from George P. Hall &amp; Son's original glass plate negatives ranging in size from 11 x 14 to 11 x 18 to 14 x 17 inches. The majority of the original negatives from which these prints were created have been destroyed. The prints produced between 1965 and 1970 by Klein Brothers are unmounted prints with a matte finish; these show a greater variety of tone than the later high-contrast, glossy prints produced by Compo Photocolor, The International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, and Wometco Photographic Services, which are mounted on paper board.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some photographs bear brief descriptive captions, dates and negative numbers handwritten in block lettering on the original negatives and printed into the photographs. The majority of the photographs have been captioned on the verso by N-YHS staff; some of these descriptions correspond to those from the original negative sleeves, but many have been assigned progressively as staff members have researched photographs over the years. Some photographs have been given more detailed descriptions than others, reflecting this individual research.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Researchers should be aware that oversize negatives from a variety of other collections belonging to The New-York Historical Society were once integrated into the Hall Collection. While efforts were made during processing to separate out all materials that could be readily attributed to other photographers, some unmarked photographs within this collection may not be the work of George P. Hall &amp; Son. Attributions of these photographs should be made with caution.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The commercial photography firm George P. Hall &amp; Son operated in Manhattan from 1886 through 1914. Working out of several studios, the firm documented the changing face of New York City at the turn of the 20th century. Hall &amp; Son's photographs were available for general sale, were published in their own calendars and souvenir viewbooks, and appeared as illustrations in such publications as King's Views of New York, Staley's Views of New York, and Harper's Weekly.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">George P. Hall (1832-1900) was born in 1832 in Troy, Ohio, and began his career in 1854 as a daguerreotypist in Dayton, Ohio. A year later he opened his first gallery in Indianapolis and then worked in St. Louis, before finally making his way to New York around 1872. He started his commercial photography business at 78 Fulton Street around 1875, and was officially joined by his son James S. Hall in 1886 when firm took the name George P. Hall &amp; Son. The father and son operated the company until 1900, when George P. Hall died. James S. Hall continued to run the business until about 1914. A brief note in the Business Troubles column of the New York Times for June 4, 1914 indicates that creditors were filing a petition against Hall, and that he admitted his insolvency. It is presumed that the firm closed in the wake of these financial difficulties.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Halls operated several studios in Manhattan. City directories published by Trow indicate that George P. Hall maintained a studio at 78 Fulton Street from 1876 to 1883. He moved his business to 157 Fulton Street in 1883, where he was joined by his son; that studio remained open until 1901. Later shops included those at 303 Broadway from 1890 to 1894, at 52 Water Street from 1897 to 1902, at 212 Broadway from 1901 to 1914, at 364 Bowery from 1902 to 1903, and at 230 Grand Street from 1903 to 1904. The Halls made their residences in Brooklyn, and often turned their cameras toward features of that city as well as Manhattan. They also worked as marine and engineering photographers.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Approximately 2000 vintage negatives from the collection of James S. Hall were purchased on June 20, 1945. The indexes are presumed to have been produced by the George P. Hall &amp; Son firm and were probably donated with the collection. Modern prints were produced between 1968 and 1975 by commercial studios under contract with the New-York Historical Society in an effort to reformat the oversize glass negatives within this collection. Between 1968 and 1972 contact prints were produced by Klein Brothers Studio, New York; between 1974 and 1975 photographic prints were produced by Wometco Photographic Services, Inc., New York, and in 1975, photographic prints were produced by Compo Photocolor, New York. After printing, most of the negatives were destroyed. An additional 103 photographic prints were provided by the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House in about 1977 from negatives donated to them by the New-York Historical Society.  In 2010, an additional 39 glass plate negatives were donated by Dolores Ballaster.</field>
