    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I: Photographs of Manhattan</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I is the largest of the photographic series, with approximately 850 modern silver gelatin prints. It is arranged into ten subseries by subject: Bridges and River Views; Churches and Temples; Cityscapes and Panoramas; Commercial Buildings; Hotels; Public Buildings and Institutions; Residences; Restaurants; Statues and Monuments; and Theaters. Each subseries is divided into mounted and unmounted. The views collectively document much of Manhattan, with a particular emphasis on major institutions, tourist attractions, waterfronts and bridges, and business districts. For convenience, this series includes photographs of popular tourist sites on the smaller, non-borough islands surrounding Manhattan; these include views of the Statue of Liberty, the Ellis Island Immigration Station, and Castle William on Governor's Island.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Halls sometimes worked as marine photographers, and more generally turned their cameras toward the rivers, harbors, and bridges surrounding New York City. The Bridges and River Views subseries includes flattering views of the waterways of New York, including everything from iconic images of foot traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge to views of the three southern East River bridges. Many views encompass the rapidly changing New York skyline taken from the surrounding waterways.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Churches and Temples subseries includes a variety exterior views of the oldest and most notable religious institutions in the city, including Trinity Church, St. Paul's Chapel, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine [Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine], and Temple Beth-El. Cityscapes and Panoramas includes views of the changing Manhattan skyline from a variety of vantage points. Hall &amp; Son frequented the roofs of tall buildings to capture the city from a dramatic overhead angle.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Commercial Buildings includes views of a variety of buildings, from banks to department stores, such as Saks &amp; Co. at its original Herald Square location, to such dramatic New York newcomers as the Flatiron (Fuller) Building during and after construction. Photographs in this subseries are mostly straightforward portraits of individual buildings; many of the same structures can be found within broader settings in the Street Scenes subseries. Photographs in the Hotels subseries are similar in nature to those of commercial buildings, primarily focusing on large elegant midtown hotels.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Public Buildings and Institutions contains views of many famous New York institutions, including a variety of views of Columbia University and Barnard College, City Hall, Federal Hall, and Tammany Hall. Photographs of the interior of Pennsylvania Station from the 1910s and of the excavation site before its construction are available in this series. Also included are views of several hospitals, museums (including The New-York Historical Society in 1907) and transportation centers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Residences depicted include the Jumel Mansion and the Tiffany Mansion, as well as unidentified brownstones and Gramercy Square residences. Restaurants holds only a few images, including Delmonico's and the Metropolitan Club's interior with a banquet set for Mayor Seth Low. Statues and Monuments includes such notables as Grant's Tomb, the Statue of Liberty, and Washington Arch as well as smaller statuary.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Street Scenes is the largest subseries and provides rich documentation of the city. Buildings, street life, and transportation means are depicted with great detail. The subseries is arranged into three categories: Named Streets, Numbered Avenues, and Numbered Streets. Within these categories, photographs are arranged alphabetically, then by ascending address (for example, note that Broadway and Fifth Avenue sections of street scenes are arranged from south to north). This series also includes views of several of the popular squares and smaller parks in the city, including many photographs of Union Square and City Hall Park. Views of Broadway from its southern extremity at Bowling Green to 145th Street are available, as are photographs of the maritime businesses along South Street. Views of many of George P. Hall &amp; Son's business premises are included within this series. A few photographs in this series show a slightly darker side of Manhattan living, such as the depiction of slum buildings along Chrystie Street. Occasional copy work is included, such as a copy of "Broadway, north from Bond Street," by Mathew Brady from 1867.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Theaters depicted include many of the popular venues of the first decade of the 1900s. Included within this category are views of Madison Square Garden (including a few interior views of exhibits), the Belasco Theatre, the Hippodrome, and the Harlem Opera House.</field>
