    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection primarily includes sermons, lectures, and other writings of Charles Edward Jefferson (1860-1937). Jefferson was pastor of Broadway Tabernacle Church in New York City from 1898 to 1929, and the bulk of the collection dates from his years at that church, though the audience for many of these writings range beyond the attendees at his church services. Many of these materials are in their published form, including those on pacifism and anti-militarism in the years leading to World War I, but there are also several sermons and lectures in their original typescript form. The collection also includes Jefferson's notes on biblical texts, letters of congratulations on his 25th anniversary at Broadway Tabernacle, some Broadway Tabernacle year books, and other documents.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection primarily includes sermons, lectures, and other writings of Charles Edward Jefferson (1860-1937). Jefferson was pastor of Broadway Tabernacle Church between 1898-1930, and the bulk of the collection dates from his years at that church. Many of these materials are in their published form, but there are also several sermons and lectures in their original typescript form. Among the materials are Jefferson's sermon at his installation as pastor, at a memorial service for assassinated U.S. president William McKinley, many of the sermons he delivered annually to the boys and girls of Broadway Tabernacle, his writings on pacifism and amti-militarism, and three essays on nature inspired by land he owned in New Hampshire. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also includes some of Jefferson's notes on biblical texts, a record of some marriages he performed, and letters of congratulations from parishioners and associates on his 25th anniversary at Broadway Tabernacle. There is also some print matter related to Broadway Tabernacle itself including, among other documents, some year books and an Endowment Fund appeal.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Charles Edward Jefferson (1860-1937) was born in Cambridge, Ohio. He attended Ohio Wesleyan University, graduating in 1882 and then taking the position of superintendent of public schools in Worthington, Ohio. He entered Boston University in 1884, briefly at its law school before moving to BU's School of Theology, from which he graduated in 1887. Shortly after graduating, he began work as pastor of the Central Congregational Church in Chelsea, Massachusetts. He remained there until early 1898 when he resigned to become the pastor of Broadway Tabernacle Church in New York City on 19 April. The materials in this collection date largely from Jefferson's years at Broadway Tabernacle.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Broadway Tabernacle was founded in 1840. Jefferson was the congregation's fifth pastor. At the time of his installation, the church was located at Broadway and 34th Street in Manhattan. It moved to Broadway and 56th Street in 1905 where it remained until 1969. The congregation is now known as the Broadway United Church of Christ and is located on West 86th Street in New York. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jefferson was pastor of Broadway Tabernacle for 31 years, resigning in 1929. He traveled and spoke widely, and was well known for his advocacy of pacifism, particularly in the years leading to America's involvement in World War I.</field>
