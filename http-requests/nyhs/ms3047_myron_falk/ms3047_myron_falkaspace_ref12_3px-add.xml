    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes material related to Myron S. Falk's travels, much of which was done for the company Wonham, Bates &amp; Goode for whom he was Chairman of the Board of Directors. Most documents are dated 1923 or after, excluding one travel diary written by Falk at 10 years old in 1888. There is also a diary that dates 1910-1934, in which Falk details some of the trips he went on, which also have material within this series. A set of snapshots from 1910-11 depict Myron and Milly on travels to Europe (primaily Italy) and to the Caribbean and Panama where they saw construction underway on the canal.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A significant amount of material in this series was obtained in his journeys with the American Silk Mission, which was a group of businessmen who traveled around East Asia visiting silk manufacturers and factories in order to discuss the silk trade. Included are newspaper clippings from regional newspapers in Asia that welcomed the Silk Mission and give context to their travels, as well as itineraries and ephemera from each factory visited. There are also many photographs, some taken by Falk, which are more candid and also larger, posed ones given to him by the factories. Of particular significance is the detailed correspondence of his journeys through China, Japan, and Korea through which he not only details his daily travels, but also comments on cultural customs of these countries through a Western perspective. Korea was occupied by Japan during this period and the impact of that occupation is noted at times by Falk. Also within this correspondence is a description of a brief meeting with Sun Yat Sen, the first provisional President of the Republic of China. </field>
