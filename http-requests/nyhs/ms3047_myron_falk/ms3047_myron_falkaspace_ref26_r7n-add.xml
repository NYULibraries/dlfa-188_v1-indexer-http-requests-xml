    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes film taken mostly by Myron Falk in the 1920s-1930s. Falk's travels to the Middle East, Egypt, Europe, Panama, Brazil, Caribbean, and Western United States are included, but there do not appear to be any images from the American Silk Mission or other Asian travel. Falk's films also include images of home and family in Greenwich, Connecticut (commonly referred to in the collection as Port Chester, New York) and elsewhere. Some moving images were made by Myron Falk Jr. (Johnny), including European travel in the 1930s and later family images. Much of the film was digitized by the family and digital copies were included with the collection and in the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">During processing, the film was not viewed. Subject content noted in the container list was derived from the various labeling found on the reels and their canisters. Various labels appear to have been added over time and the container list notes their references, to the extent they could be read. All but a few reels included a reference number and a "new" number; both numbers are included in the container list. </field>
