    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series brings together photographs that were not found with other documents or related correspondence in the collection. They include personal photographs of Falk and his family, friends, and associates. There are also three photograph albums, one from 1903 in Yellowstone with captions, one likely from circa 1880s-90s relating to the Einstein family, and a third which could not be placed.
Also included are oversize photos and drawings depicting a variety of subjects, such as dinners, a panorama of Myron Jr.'s Yale graduation, the Ordnance Department in Washington, D.C. during World War I, and Falk's parents.
There is also a book of pictures of buildings with their addresses, built by H.H. Oddie Inc of which Falk was Chief Engineer.</field>
