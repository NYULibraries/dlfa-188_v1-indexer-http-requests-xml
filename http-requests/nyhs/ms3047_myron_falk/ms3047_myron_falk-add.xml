    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Myron S. Falk papers include documents related to the personal and professional life of Myron S. Falk (1878-1945), an engineer from New York City. The collection spans from 1867-1947, although the bulk of the collection dates from the 20th century, after Falk graduated with a Civil Engineering degree from Columbia University (1899) and Mechanical Engineering degree from Stevens Institute of Technology (1900).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Falk's professional career is represented in this collection through his published works on engineering and his correspondence with companies he worked for, such as H.H. Oddie Inc, the American Bemberg Corporation, and the trading company Wonham, Bates, and Goode, for whom he would often travel.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A significant portion of travel correspondence, ephemera, and photographs derives from his journey in 1923 to China, Japan, and Korea with the American Silk Mission, which met with and discussed trade with silk manufacturers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Additionally, there is an abundance of financial and legal documents regarding Falk and his family, including wills, estate and trust accounts, tax documents, ledgers, appraisals of his homes, and general financial correspondence and bills, some of which touch upon his involvement with Mercury Theatre.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is also a scrapbook that contains information that commemorates important events involving Falk and his family, such as Columbia University Class of 1899 memorabilia, World War I and World War II clippings, clippings on their home Tophill Farm, and his children's wedding invitations and graduation pamphlets.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also included in the collection is correspondence from Falk's time in the Ordnance Department during World War I and World War II, where he worked designing and manufacturing ammunition plants. Correspondence and artifacts also represent the numerous associations he was involved in, such as the Harmonie Club, the Society of American Magicians, Mt. Sinai Hospital committees, and Congregation Emanu-El. There is also a significant amount of condolence notes from when Falk died in 1945.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also holds an assortment of photographs of his family and travels, some of which are in photo albums with captions or indexes, and others are loose with little identifying information.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also in the collection are reels of film. Many of these were taken by Falk on his travels during the 1920s and later and many are home movies of his family. Several of the reels are from the years after Falk's death and were taken by Myron Falk, Jr. The family had many of these digitized and the digital files are on a USB and a set of DVDs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Myron S. Falk was born in New York City on 13 September 1878. His parents were Arnold Falk (1843-1891) and Fannie Falk (1856-1920). Falk graduated as a Civil Engineer from Columbia University in 1899, and as a Mechanical Engineer from Stevens Institute in 1900. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia in 1904. He spent ten years at Columbia teaching in the Civil Engineering Department, where he wrote text books on the design of bridges with Professor of Civil Engineering, William A. Burr. While teaching, Falk was made head of the Testing Laboratory which resulted in his book "Cements, Mortars and Concretes." In 1904 he was appointed a member of the New York Bay Pollution Commission by Governor Benjamin B. Odell to investigate the pollution of New York Harbor. In 1905 he was appointed Consulting Engineer to the New York State Water Supply Commission, which had control and supervision of all water supplies in the state, including New York City. In 1905, he became Chief Engineer of the Godwin Construction Company. Two years later he became Chief Engineer of H.H. Oddie Inc, a New York construction firm. At the same time, he formed an association with Albert B. Hager, Civil Engineer, with whom he designed many steel building frames for architects. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1917 Falk was appointed Major in the Ordnance Department of the Army and was in charge of the production of raw materials for the Ammunition Division during World War I. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel before his retirement in July 1919. He became Chairman of the Board of Directors of Wonham, Bates &amp; Goode Trading Corporation in 1920, which was a branch of M. Samuel &amp; Co. Ltd, of London, an importing and exporting firm for whom he made trips to China, Japan, Brazil, Cuba, etc. In 1923, he traveled with the American Silk Mission to China, Japan, and Korea to discuss silk trade. He resigned his position at Wonham in 1927 to become Vice President and Chief Engineer of the American Bemberg Corporation, for which he built a large plant for the manufacture of rayon at Johnson City, Tennessee. He was also Consulting Engineer to many other projects, such as the construction of the Temple Emanu-El at 65th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City. He also served as an officer and director of the Mercury Theatre.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Falk retired from all active work in 1928 but in 1941, in the months leading to America's entry into World War II, he returned to the Ordnance Department as Consulting Engineer to the Ammunition Division. Based primarily in Washington, Falk was a special assistant to the chief of the division on matters concerning the construction and operation of about seventy powder, explosives and loading plants. In late 1942, Falk was commissioned into the Army and assigned to the St. Louis Ammunition Branch as Head Engineer, before transferring in 1943 to the New York District as Principal Engineer of Industrial Production.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Falk was also associated with various organizations, some referencing his Jewish heritage, such as the Hebrew Technical Institute, the Institute for the Deaf, the Home for Aged and Infirm Hebrews, chairman of the Lavanburg Foundation, and trustee and chairman of the Building and Laboratory Committees of Mt. Sinai Hospital. He was in Harmonie Club, Engineers Club, Columbia University Club, and the Army-Navy Club. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1903, Falk married Milly Judith Einstein (1883-1915) whose father was Henry L. Einstein, a wool manufacturer and owner of New York Press. The Falks had two daughters, Eleanor and Mildred, and a son, Myron Falk Jr., who was known as "Johnny." Falk purchased in 1913 Tophill Farm on King Street in Greenwich, Conn.; the property is commonly referred to in the documents as being in Port Chester, N.Y., which was the closest town center/train station. After Falk's death in 1945, the property was sold to the Thermix Corporation as their new headquarters. It was in the vicinity of what is now the Brunswick School's pre-and lower schools.</field>
