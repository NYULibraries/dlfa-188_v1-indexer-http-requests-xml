    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes material generated and assembled by Gramercy Neighborhood Associates, Inc. (known before 1966 as the Gramercy Park Association), such as organizational records (1911–2009), subject files (1831–2004), documentation of the annual Gramercy Park Flower Show (1947–1994), images (1828–2000), books, pamphlets, and periodicals (1894–2009), and maps (1831–1953).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The organizational records include scattered meeting minutes, annual reports, committee, secretary, and treasurer reports, correspondence, by-laws, notices, invitations, fliers, and blank stationery. The subject files cover Gramercy Park proper, the surrounding neighborhood, its architecture, notable residents, and businesses. The Gramercy Park Flower Show, first held in 1947 and running annually as late as 1994, is represented by advertisements, brochures, internal memos and correspondence, invitations, newspaper clippings, and posters. The collection's images—consisting of photographs (many are copy prints), stereoviews, and postcards—capture Gramercy Park and other areas of Manhattan, mainly south of 23rd Street. Of particular note is a set of color photographs documenting cleanup efforts by Consolidated Edison after a steam pipe explosion released a cloud of asbestos over the neighborhood on August 19, 1989. Books and pamphlets about the park and neighborhood—most factual, but some fictional, like Victoria Thompson's Murder on Gramercy Park: A Gaslight Mystery (2001)—are supplemented by runs of local periodicals, namely the Gramercy Graphic (1954–1967), Gramercy Herald (1970–1985), Gramercy Neighborhood News (1988–1990), Gramercy: The Newsletter for the Gramercy Neighborhood (1991–1993), Gramercy Neighborhood Associates (1997), Gramercy Gazette (1997–2009), and the New York Chronicle (1987–1999), which carried contributions by longtime Gramercy Neighborhood Associates archivist Stephen Garmey in its pages. A series of original and reproduction maps of the neighborhood completes the collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gramercy Park, an approximately two-acre green space and surrounding neighborhood of the same name in Manhattan, was developed beginning in 1831 by attorney and politician Samuel B. Ruggles (1799–1881). Ruggles bought the land from a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, drained the marsh formed by the "Krom Moerasje" brook (its name, in Dutch, which meant "crooked little swamp," was anglicized to "Gramercy"), and offered 66 building lots for sale. Lot holders enjoyed exclusive access to the park, which today remains one of only two private parks in New York City. Early residents included Valentine Mott (1785–1865), chief medical officer of the Union army during the Civil War and the founder of Bellevue Hospital; lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong (1820–1875); and James Harper (1795–1869), publisher and 65th mayor of the City of New York (1844–1845).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gramercy Park proper occupies a site between East 20th and East 21st Streets (a.k.a. Gramercy Park South and Gramercy Park North, respectively), midway between Third Avenue and Park Avenue South. A proposed bill to extend Lexington Avenue south through the park to join Irving Place prompted the formation in 1912 of the Gramercy Park Association (not to be confused with the older "Trustees of Gramercy Park," which first met in 1844 to oversee access to and maintenance of the park, or the "Gramercy Neighborhood Association," an anti-vice organization active circa 1913). The Gramercy Park Association successfully stopped the Lexington Avenue extension bill, thus maintaining the park's rectangular layout. That battle won, the association subsequently engaged in a variety of community service projects, such as the annual Gramercy Park Flower Show (1947–1994), and the replacement of the neighborhood's modern lampposts with historic reproductions of the bishop's crook design. In 1966, to qualify for tax exemption as a charitable organization under New York State law, the Gramercy Park Association incorporated as the Gramercy Neighborhood Associates, Inc. (GNA). The GNA remains "dedicated to enhancing the aesthetic qualities and historic character of the Gramercy neighborhood and to developing a sense of community" through partnerships with area schools and local businesses.
