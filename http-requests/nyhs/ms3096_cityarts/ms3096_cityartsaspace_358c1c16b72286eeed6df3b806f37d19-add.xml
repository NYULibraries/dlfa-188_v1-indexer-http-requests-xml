    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds about 130 binders documenting about 290 of CITYarts's projects from its earliest in 1969 to those of the early 2010s. The content is primarily photographic, with slides, snapshots and, later, digital formats comprising the bulk of the series. These images document the artwork itself as well as the creation process. Many binders also include related documents, such as "fact sheets" about the project, press clippings, press releases, flyers, artist statements, etc. The first box holds a master list of projects with data about artist, location, collaborators, sponsors, etc. that is useful for an overview. The bulk of the binders relate to one or more specific projects. A small set of the binders include select photographs and other materials that cut across the projects.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list below includes the titles from the binder covers. Especially for binders with multiple projects not necessarily listed in the binder cover, the notes include further identifying information taken from documents within the binder and/or from the master list in Box 1. The locations/addresses recorded here are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Almost all the binders include photographs, often in the form of slides. The container list does not repeat this fact for each binder; instead the container list indicates when photos are NOT present. Almost all the binders also have at least some identifying, publicity, or other documentation with the photographs, though this is not consistently noted in the container list.</field>
