    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Three photographers and studios are represented in the series:
Florence Vandamm, of Vandamm Studio (in operation in New York from 1924 to 1964), has been posited as the "inventor" of the commercial head shot and noted for her use of lighting, costume and movement.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leo Friedman and Joseph Abeles commenced their publicity photography parternship Friedman-Abeles in 1954 and produced documented the New York theatrical world using their handheld Rolleiflex camera. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Martha Swope, of Swope Associates, was a former dancer who also began her photographic career in the 1950s and, like Friedman-Abeles, shot backstage activities and the rehearsal process for publicity and documentary purposes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most productions depicted in the collection are from Broadway, though some national tours, international troupes such as France's Theatre National Populaire, and off-Broadway programming such as the Brooklyn Academy of Music Next Wave Festival appear. The collection documents the original runs of iconic musicals My Fair Lady,  A Little Night Music,  A Chorus Line,  Oklahoma!,  1776, and  Cats (the title most substantially represented in the collection), in addition to new plays, revivals, and multiple iterations of productions such as  Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Tennessee Williams's  The Night of the Iguana. Notable subjects include theatre stalwarts such as Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt (in  Quadrille) and a young Robert De Niro (in  Last Stand, with Diane Ladd, and later  Cuba and His Teddy Bear).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are also portraits of Judy Holliday, Helen Hayes, and others, and a small selection of Swope's ballet and dance photography, including the New York City Ballet and its star ballerina Patricia McBride. Additionally, this series contains  a small number of Playbill programs, press kit materials, clippings, and ticket stubs. </field>
