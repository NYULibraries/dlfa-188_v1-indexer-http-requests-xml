    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series is comprised of materials related to Edgar J. Nathan, Jr.'s position as delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1938. Much of the series constitutes documents regarding the 1937 election, including voting schedules and results, colorful district maps, candidate promotional materials and other ephemera, and correspondence in light of Nathan's victory. However, the series also includes correspondence about the convention itself, such as a letter from Nathan to his wife, Mabel, on the daily routine at the convention, fairly extensive records on amendments proposed in Albany, and a souvenir poster signed by the members of the Committee on the Judiciary (especially significant are the signatures of Al Smith and Robert Wagner). Post-convention correspondence, which is also included in the series, is primarily in regards to dinner reunion plans and two funerals for former delegates to the convention. Additionally, the series contains 11 of the original 12 volumes of reading material sent out to the delegates in preparation for their duties, which mainly concern foundational information on U.S. government and constitutional history.</field>
