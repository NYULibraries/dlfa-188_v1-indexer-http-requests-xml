    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series II: Henry Fairfield Osborn papers</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II, Henry Fairfield Osborn papers, is organized into five subseries. (Note that this Series does not include the family correspondence of Henry Fairfield Osborn, which is found in Series I, Family Papers.) </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II.1, Correspondence and related materials, includes HFO's non-family correspondence, primarily with professional colleagues and scientist friends.  The most frequent correspondent is HFO's Princeton classmate and fellow paleontologist William Berryman Scott. Their letters (foldered separately) discuss both personal news and professional matters. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The remaining correspondence is foldered chronologically, and includes frequent letters between HFO and British evolutionary biologist Sir Edward B. Poulton. Other notable correspondents include Howard Crosby Butler, Charles F. Dawes, Seth Low, John Muir, John Stewart Kingsley, and Edith Roosevelt.  Topics include professional research, publications and speaking engagements, and news about colleagues and friends.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II.2, Associations and honors, includes correspondence and other papers relating to HFO's numerous memberships in professional and social organizations and clubs, and his many honorary degrees, medals and decorations.  Notable memberships include several organizations that promoted eugenics and/or racial purity, including the American Eugenics Society, the American Genetic Association, the Aryan Society, and the Galton Society. HFO was also a member of the exclusive Zodiac Club, along with J.P. Morgan, and this subseries includes invitations to dinners and other Zodiac Club correspondence.  There are also several folders of correspondence relating to alumni events at Princeton.  In addition, there is material relating to tributes in honor of HFO's birthdays, his retirement from AMNH and various other occasions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II.3, Speaking engagements and publications, includes programs and announcements of some of HFO's lectures, and drafts of a talk ("What a Girl Can Do") and article on the topic of suitable occupations for women. Also included are articles by HFO on religion and evolution and on the history of the New York Zoological Society, which HFO founded (now known as the Wildlife Conservation Society, it manages the Bronx Zoo, Central Park Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo, Queens Zoo and the New York Aquarium). There are also several folders of notes and drafts, and several folders of correspondence with Charles Scribner's Sons, who published multiple books by HFO.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II.4, Professional appointments and biographical information, contains material relating to HFO's tenure as President of the American Museum of Natural History (1908-1933).  This includes correspondence and papers relating to the "Bumpus Affair" of 1910-1911, a conflict over exhibits between HFO and AMNH director Dr. H.C. Bumpus which resulted in the latter's resignation, and correspondence concerning the Roosevelt Memorial (cornerstone laid in 1931). Also included is one folder of material relating to HFO's appointment as a professor at Columbia University, and some biographical articles and notes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II.5, Journals, consists primarily of annual leather-bound datebooks kept by HFO between 1899 and 1935. These contain both professional and personal notations, regarding appointments, engagements, travel and scientific observations, birthdays of friends and families, and significant events.  Clippings, calling cards and similar materials were sometimes inserted next to related entries; to retain context, these have not been removed so researchers should be careful when handling. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are also a few more extensive travel and expedition journals: 1867-68, 1871 (Europe), 1879 (Coburg/London), 1885 (Germany), 1913 (Western United States), and 1922 (China/Mongolia).  </field>
