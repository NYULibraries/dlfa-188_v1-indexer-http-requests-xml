    <field name="abstract_teim">The Osborn Family Papers consist of personal correspondence between members of the family (including forebears) of Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857-1935), paleontologist and for many years the head of the Museum of Natural History, as well as some of his professional correspondence and papers.  Family correspondence spans the period from 1832 to 1936, and reflects the everyday affairs of several generations and branches of a prosperous New York family.

    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1832-1936</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Osborn Family Papers includes correspondence and journals from members of the Sturges, Osborn and Perry families, spanning the century from 1832 to 1936. The collection is primarily focused on Henry Fairfield Osborn, famed paleontologist and long-time director of the Museum of Natural History, but also includes correspondence of his grandparents (Jonathan Sturges and Mary Cady Sturges), parents (William Osborn and Virginia Sturges Osborn), wife (Lucretia Perry Osborn), children (Virginia, Perry, Fairfield Junior, and Josephine), and various other relatives and family friends.  These well-pedigreed families moved in New York's elite circles and the papers reflect the daily life and concerns of privileged members of New York's society in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is organized into the following three series:  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I, Family papers, consists primarily of correspondence between several generations of family members.  Letters relate news of family members and friends, discuss current events, and describe modes and incidents of travel, both domestic and abroad.  Health and religion are also frequent topics. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I also includes Henry Fairfield Osborn's family correspondence with his parents and siblings, and with his wife Lucretia Perry Osborn, as well as their correspondence with their four surviving children.  There are also several boxes of correspondence and clippings relating to Lulu Osborn's 1927 monograph Washington in His Own Words.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to correspondence, Series I includes deeds and leases for family property, genealogical and biographical information, several folders of family ephemera and photographs (including visas and passports), and a few journals or diaries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II, Henry Fairfield Osborn papers, includes his non-family correspondence with professional associates and organizations.  Frequent correspondents include fellow paleontologist and friend William Berryman Scott, and British evolutionary biologist Edward Bagnell Poulton.  Series II also includes Henry Fairfield Osborn's journals/datebooks from 1899 to 1921, as well as a few earlier journals. These consist primarily of calendar-type entries detailing Osborn's professional activities as well as events in his personal life; there are also a few journals containing more extensive accounts of his travels and expeditions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III, Transcriptions and oversize material, includes typed transcriptions of hand-written letters of Henry Fairfield Osborn to his father and brother, and to William Berryman Scott, along with transcriptions of a few diary excerpts.  This series also includes some oversize ephemera and biographical notes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">This collection includes personal papers and journals from Henry Fairfield Osborn ("HFO") and his family, forebears and descendants, encompassing several generations of the Sturges, Osborn and Perry families. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">HFO's maternal grandfather, Jonathan Sturges (1802-1874), was born in Southport, Connecticut, and in 1821 joined the grocery business of Lumen Reed (1787-1836).  Lumen Reed was a highly successful merchant who also assembled one of the earliest and most significant collections of American art.  Sturges shared Reed's interest in the arts and became an important patron and collector of American artists in his own right.  After Reed's death, Sturges led a group who bought his art collection, which was eventually donated to the New-York Historical Society.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1828, Sturges married Mary Pemberton Cady (1806-1894), also born in Connecticut.  The Cady family moved to Fredericksburg when Mary was 12 years old, but returned to New York City in 1826. After their marriage, the couple lived in New York City, and had six children.  In 1840, they built a country retreat in Fairfield, Connecticut, known as "The Cottage." Still standing, the house is one of the earliest example of American Gothic Revival architecture, and in 1994 was designated a National Historic Landmark.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Well-educated, cultured, and wealthy, the Sturges were connected with the artistic and commercial elite of New York, as described in Mary Sturges' memoir Reminiscences of a Long Life (also held in the N-YHS library). One daughter, Amelia, married Pierpont Morgan in 1861, but died of tuberculosis four months after their wedding. Their oldest daughter, Virginia Reed Sturges (1830-1902), married William Henry Osborn in 1858.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">William Henry Osborn (1820-1894) was a railroad executive, becoming President of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1853, and later heading the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad. William and Virginia Osborn lived in a sumptuous mansion at 32 Park Avenue, and later also built a mansion known as Castle Rock in Garrison, New York, which served as the family's summer home.  The Osborn's had four children, two of whom (Virginia and Frederick) died as young adults. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Their eldest surviving son, Henry Fairfield Osborn (1857-1935), became a famous paleontologist and served as director of the Museum of Natural History from 1908 to 1935, building the foundation for its outstanding fossil and dinosaur collection.  Deeply religious, Osborn was a proponent of the now-discredited theory of orthogenesis to explain evolution, holding that an ill-defined guiding force shaped life from lesser to greater forms, and was also a firm believer in eugenics. These ideas, reflected in the collection, have tarnished Osborn's scientific and moral reputation with later generations.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Henry Fairfield Osborn married Lucretia Thatcher Perry ("Lulu," 1858-1930) in 1881. Lulu was the daughter of Brigadier General Alexander James Perry and Josephine Adams Perry; her sister, Josephine, married Junius Morgan in 1891. Henry and Lulu had five children, the youngest of whom died in infancy.  </field>
