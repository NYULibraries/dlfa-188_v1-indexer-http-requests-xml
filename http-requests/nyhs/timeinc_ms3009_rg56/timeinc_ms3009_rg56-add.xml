    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Part of the collection contains records using the name Time Life International and part contains records using the name Time Inc. International. See the Historical Note for more information. During the time span represented by their files in the collection, Martin Gardner was Vice President of Time Inc. International and Mike Taylor worked on "strategic aspects of international magazine publishing" according to his LinkedIn profile viewed in 2021.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of correspondence, reports and information on ad sales, subscriptions, and expenses for Time Inc. International Magazines, discussion of pay and benefits for employees, assessments of the states of publishing ventures and proposals for future action, budgets, and samples of magazines.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Time Life International was responsible for the sale of Time Inc. magazines outside the United States. This included setting up offices in cities around the world and establishing communications between this foreign offices and Time Inc. headquarters in New York City and printing and shipping versions of American magazines (such as Time ) tailored for specific regions around the world. Time Inc. headquarters retained significant control over foreign offices in terms of editorial, hiring, changes in pay and benefits for employees, and purchasing of office space and equipment. Between 1967 and 1968 the name of the division was changed to Corporate International, but seems to have retained the same staff and functions. Later, a division called Time Inc. International handled these same functions, suggesting the latter is the same division after another name change, but there is not direct evidence for this in the collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to the functions described above, Time Inc. International also made deals with foreign publishers to license the names of Time Inc. magazines such as Fortune; such operations were governed by agreements regarding content and style but not under the direct control of Time Inc. Time Inc. International also published original magazines in foreign countries such as Who Weekly in Australia.</field>
