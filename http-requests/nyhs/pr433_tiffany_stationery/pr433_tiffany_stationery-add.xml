    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1837, Charles Lewis Tiffany and John B. Young opened a "stationery and fancy goods emporium" at 259 Broadway in New York City. Charles Tiffany's father Comfort Tiffany financed the store with a $1,000 loan. Initially known as Tiffany &amp; Young (1837-1841) and later Tiffany, Young &amp; Ellis (1841-1853),the store sold stationery products, glassware, silverware, jewelry, and porcelain. Unlike other stores at the time, Tiffany clearly marked the prices on its goods (to avoid haggling); only accepted cash payments; and did not allow purchases on credit. The first Tiffany mail order catalog, known as the "Blue Book", was published in 1845. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Charles Lewis Tiffany took sole control of the company in 1853, renamed it Tiffany &amp; Company, and established the company's emphasis on jewelry, especially pieces featuring silver and precious stones. By 1877, the company had acquired the Tiffany diamond, a large yellow stone from the Kimberley Mines in South Africa. In 1887, Tiffany acquired major pieces at the sale of the French Crown Jewels in Paris.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On his father's death in 1902, Louis Comfort Tiffany became design director, and the company became one of the leading proponents of the Art Nouveau style. 
In 1905, the Manhattan flagship store was relocated to the corner of 37th Street and Fifth Avenue; it moved to the present address, Fifth Avenue and 57th street, in 1940.</field>
