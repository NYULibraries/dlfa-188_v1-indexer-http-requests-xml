    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I fills boxes 1 through 12 and forms the bulk of the collection. These photographs are all mounted on board, as described above, except for one folder of unmounted photographs of Bergdorf Goodman, and a spiral-bound notebook including a few photographs of a variety of stores. The Bergdorf photos are filed in with those from the albums. The notebook is filed at the end of the series. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Bergdorf Goodman, Bernhard Ulmann, Kaufman's, S. M. Frank &amp; Company, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Woolf Brothers are represented by the largest numbers of photographs. Architectural plans for the Bergdorf Goodman renovations are also included in this series. Color photographs were taken of the Detroit Saks Fifth Avenue and the Kansas City Woolf Brothers jobs; these are noted in the box listing. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While most of the Silver &amp; Co. work was for the garment trade, several other types of businesses are represented here. The offices of the law firm Strasser, Spiegelburg, Fried &amp; Frank (now known as Fried, Frank) and the executive offices of Sterling Drug are represented. C &amp; L Delicatessen, a midtown Manhattan restaurant, is also shown. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In general, these photographs are stark shots meant to show the new interiors and display cases. People appear only in a few images of Bergdorf Goodman (before renovation). Publicity and clippings from Series IV, as well as correspondence from Series III, were used to provide dates from some of these photographs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs are arranged alphabetically by company or store name, and then by city where necessary. The number of prints follows the name in parentheses.</field>
