    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also contains photographs taken on many walks during the 1980s and 1990s. The photos document the various locations in and around New York that Shorewalkers members walked including: lower Manhattan, Central Park, Harlem, the West Side HIghway, Washington Heights and Inwood, the South Bronx, Coney Island, Red Hook, Far Rockway Bungalows, Bay Ridge, Jamaica Bay, and bridges. The photos also captured walks along the Hudson River Shore Trail with places such as Croton Creek, West Point, the Albany River, Bear Mountain, Newburgh, Storm King State Park, Cold Spring, and Poughkeepsie, NY. Many photos, particularly those of the Hudson River waterfront, document what the areas looked like before development. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Shorewalkers, Inc. was founded in 1982 by Cyrus Adler and other environmentalists to explore the entire waterfront and shore trails in the New York Metropolitan area. Shorewalkers' mission is to explore, enhance, enjoy, and protect the parks, promenades, and paths along the waters in and around the greater New York metropolitan region. Shorewalkers' first hike took place Sunday, December 12, 1982 along the west coast of Manhattan. Their announcement read: "Explore the changing Hudson River Coast, Battery Park, the Westway Route, active piers, through Penn-Central railroad yards and into Riverside Park. Lunch stop in Harlem. Wilderness above the George Washington Bridge, wind up in an Irish pub in Inwood." They ventured along Manhattan's waterfront at a time when the Manhattan waterfront greenway was not a accessible as it is today. Since 1982, thousands of people have explored the New York, Newark, and Jamaica Bays; the Hudson, Bronx, Hackensack, and Passaic Rivers; the Gowanus, Newtown, and other inlets; the Croton Aqueduct; the Long Island Sound, and Atlantic Ocean among other waterways. Among their most well known walks are The Great Saunter, an annual all day hike along Manhattan's 32-mile shoreline, and the annual Walk off the Turkey (WOTT), a post-Thanksgiving Day hike.  
 
Shorewalkers' continues to promote the Hudson River Shore Trail, a 56-mile trail along the Hudson River up through New York state ending at Bear Mountain, known as the "Batt to Bear Trail." The Shorewalkers' efforts to preserve the Hudson River shoreline contributed to the creation of the Waterfront Greenway enjoyed by New Yorker's today. Among the organization's many supporters was the folk singer Pete Seeger, who wrote the lyrics for the Shorewalkers' Saunter.</field>
