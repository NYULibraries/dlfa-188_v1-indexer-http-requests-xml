    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials in this collection document Cyrus Adler's involvement with political and environmental organizations in New York, and with various transportation initiatives, such as the Westway Highway and Central Park Toll Tunnel.  The materials span the time period from the 1950s to 2011, and include fliers, news clippings, and correspondence. The bulk of the collection concerns Shorewalkers, Inc., a non-profit organization Adler founded in 1982 to clean up and make publicly accessible the many waterfronts surrounding New York City, particularly the Hudson River waterfront.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Cyrus Adler was born in Brooklyn in 1927, and for many years taught oceanography, physics, and math at City College of New York, Long Island University, and other educational institutions.   A long time resident of  Manhattan's upper west side, Adler has since the 1950's been very involved in community and political organizations. He played a leading role in the West 97th/98th Street Block Association and their efforts to transform a defunct restroom into a community and information center.  In addition, Adler was active in many New York-based democratic polical organizations, such as the Riverside Democrats and the Stevensonian Democratic Club..  Adler also played a role in various transporation initiatives in the 1970's and 1980's, advocating for  projects like the Westway Highway Tunnel and Central Park Toll Tunnel to move vehicular traffic underground and create more park space for the public. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1982, Adler founded Shorewalkers, Inc., a not-for-profit organization founded to promote greater access to New York's waterfront, encourage shore walking, and advance preservation and enhancement of metropolitan shorelines. At the time, large portions of the New York-New Jersey shoreline were inaccessible and/or lined with trash and rubble.  As the urban shipping industry declined, abandoned piers were inhabited by homeless people and drug dealers. By organizing hikes and excursions along waterfront areas throughout the metropolitan region, Shorewalkers helped spur their transformation into parks and greenways. In particular, their efforts contributed to the creation of the Hudson River Greenway, the 11-mile route from Battery Park to the George Washington Bridge. Adler has written several books, and numerous articles and reviews.</field>
