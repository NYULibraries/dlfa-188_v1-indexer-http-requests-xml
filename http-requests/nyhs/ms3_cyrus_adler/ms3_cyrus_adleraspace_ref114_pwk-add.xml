    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains fliers, correspondence, news clippings, and other materials about the various transportation initiatives Adler took part in during the late decades of the 20th century. The bulk of the materials pertain to the Westway Highway Tunnel Project during the 1970s and 1980s. Developed by Governor Rockefeller's Urban Development Corp., the Westway Plan gained support after a section of the West Side Highway (WSH) collapsed in 1973. This massive project called for new landfill to extend 1,000 feet into the river, a sunken two-tiered highway, parks, and new real estate development.  Many New Yorkers supported this plan, including Adler, who argued that this new highway would be used by trucks and cars, eliminate pollution, transform the waterfront, and act as a catalyst for the redevelopment of the West Side. The Westway received approval from both city and the Federal government, but the proposal was rejected in 1985 due to environmental issues. The various documents included in this series capture both the supporting and opposing viewpoints of the project and what led to its demise.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among the various organizations that Mr. Adler was involved with to promote the Westway Highway was the Scientists' Committee for Public Information, Inc. (SCPI). Founded in 1958, SCPI was an organization of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose purpose was to objectively evaluate technical issues of a project that would allow the public to make informed decisions. The SCPI's Transportation subcommittee acted as coordinator for several teams of experts who examined the various subsections of the West Side Highway Project Environmental Impact Statement. Also included are materials on two subsequent proposals to restore the West Side Highway: the Route 9A Reconstruction Project and the Miller Highway Project.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is also a small amount of material on Adler's efforts to improve bus service and the Central Park Toll Tunnel.  </field>
