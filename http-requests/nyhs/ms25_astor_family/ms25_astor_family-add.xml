In a letter addressed to Robert Neilson, London, February 16, 1854, Astor references political unrest in Europe during the time and speculates that should war break out, America would most likely remain a neutral party as it was in its best interest, until other 'Powers' joined in the war and put pressure on the United States.  In March, France declared war on Russia, marking the start of the Crimean War.  Astor's prediction of US neutrality proved true.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3.William Backhouse Astor's Letterbook, dated 1859-1864.  There are two letters addressed to Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of Treasury in Abraham Lincoln's cabinet, regarding transfer of moneys.

He also comments that the banks had been the government's principal creditors since the 'rebellion commenced.' Civil War.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">5. James Madison commission to soldier John Bateman.  Includes James Madison's signature from during his tenure as president.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">For years, the Astor family was the wealthiest family in the world thanks to both the fur trade and real estate market.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Astor family was established in New York City by John Jacob Astor in 1784.  Although Astor bought his first piece of land in 1799, he derived most of his wealth from his American Fur Company (founded in 1808) until the 1830's.  At that point, foreseeing the rapid northward expansion of New York City, Astor began to buy and develop large tracts of Manhattan real estate.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">His son, William Backhouse Astor, followed in his father's footsteps, and was rumored to know every single inch of land in his possession -- not as farfetched as it sounds, as he kept precise books detailing these properties which can be found in this collection.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Astor family largely remained in New York, although in 1891, William Waldorf Astor moved his family to Britain, creating an Astor lineage in Europe. Even after moving, William Waldorf Astor kept a close eye on the family's real estate dealings, depending a great deal on correspondence between John Coode-Adams, his London agent, and C.W. Baldwin, his agent in New York.  Many of their letters concerning the business transactions of the Astor family are also found in this collection of documents.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The family's land holdings were not limited to New York, and they had properties stretching across the country to Oregon, where there is a city named after the original trading post John Jacob Astor had established in 1811, Astoria, located at the mouth of the Columbia River.</field>
