    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes twelve photographs taken by Ron Galella. With the exception of a photo taken at a concert in New Jersey, all are scenes from New York City. All are black and white, except for a color composite made in response to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. There are also nine photographs of the 1939-40 and 1964-65 printed by Galella from negatives held by the World's Fair collector John Riccardelli. All of the photos are signed by Galella. None of the photographs are of celebrities. The subjects of the photographs are noted more specifically in the container list. In addition to photographs, the collection holds some publicity material and a Time magazine article and documentary film on DVD about Galella and his work. The DVD, as a digital format, is restricted from use.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Photographer Ron Galella was born in the Bronx, New York, in 1931. He served as a United States Air Force photographer (1951-1955) during the Korean War and later attended the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, California, graduating with a degree in photojournalism in 1958. He began taking candid photographs of celebrities, eventually making it his specialty, becoming one of the leading edge of "papazazzi" photographers. Jackie Kennedy Onassis was perhaps his most famous subject, or target, depending on one's perspective as Galella's relentless approach often received a negative, even violent, response from those he photographed.</field>
