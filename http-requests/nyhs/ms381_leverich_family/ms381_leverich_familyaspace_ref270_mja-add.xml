    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence of Annie Leverich dates from 1882 to 1890. During her husband Edward's lifetime, the letters in her letter books are primarily to him and deal largely with family matters; other letters record her relationship with long-time family friend George Payne and her dealings with merchants. After Edward's death, the correspondence of Annie Leverich deals in large part with the management of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry Plantations. Annie Leverich sold Oak Lawn and Dogberry in 1888, and some of the correspondence from that and the previous year deals with the sale of the property. Much of the later correspondence (1888-1890) deals with a lawsuit brought against Mrs. Leverich by the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company, and with Mrs. Leverich's countersuit. Principal correspondents are L. Murray Ferris of the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company, and the law firms of Foster &amp; Mentz and Rouse &amp; Grant of New Orleans, and Glover, Sweezy &amp; Glover of New York. Correspondence with the real estate and insurance firm of Seton &amp; Wissman, of New York, and with Frank deR. Wissman, documents Annie Leverich's business holdings in that city. Letters to relatives include those to Fred Schuchardt, her [nephew], and Ferdinand Schuchardt, her [cousin]. She continued the business relationship that her husband had had with Abe Leverich, even after the sale of Oak Lawn. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">All of the above-named persons are represented in Annie Leverich's letter books. Aside from family matters and her legal affairs, and the operation of the plantation, Annie Leverich's letter books contain material regarding her ultimate sale of Oak Lawn, including an inventory of the property and letters to prospective buyers. After her sale of Oak Lawn, Annie Leverich moved to Pass Christian, Mississippi. Her later letter books were created there, and much of her correspondence from this period concerns her ongoing legal dispute with the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company. A small address book is also part of this subseries. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Unlike the more business-oriented correspondence of the partners in Leverich &amp; Co., Edward and Annie Leverich's letter books also contain some family gossip and passing comments on the news of the day. </field>
