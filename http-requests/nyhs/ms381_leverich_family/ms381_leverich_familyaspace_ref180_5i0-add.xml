    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The inclusive dates for the material pertaining to Charles P. Leverich are 1829 to 1874. Most of the correspondents are southern businessmen or planters and business affairs play prominently in their letters. Correspondents include A. McWilliams, who wrote from Camperdown, a plantation in Louisiana, and A. D. Shepard of Franklin, Louisiana. Both of these men wrote mainly about sugar and cotton. C. A. F. Rondeau, of New Orleans, wrote on behalf of the Louisiana State Bank. Letters from William E. Leverich of New Orleans have to do with Leverich &amp; Co.'s Louisiana interests in general. Letters from clients of Charles P. Leverich, in his capacity as a cotton factor, include those from Stephen Duncan of Natchez, Mississippi, and William J. Minor, also of Natchez. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Charles P. Leverich's answers to some of this correspondence can be found in his letter books, which date from 1839 to 1844, 1841 to 1845, and 1853 to 1854. In the letter books, he concerns himself primarily with financial affairs and international trade, and only to a lesser extent addresses specific dealings in Southern commodities. Much of the unbound material addressed to Charles P. Leverich dates from the period 1860-1868; his letter books date from an earlier period. Thus, the persons and firms represented in the letter books are not always the same as those represented in the loose correspondence. Persons who appear frequently in the letter books are L. Millandon, J.H. Leverich and P.J. Palfrey of New Orleans, John S. Riddle and Charles P. Relf of Philadelphia, and Newton Mercer of Natchez. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Virtually every Southern correspondent of Charles P. Leverich commented on the political events of 1860-1861. The majority of material in the Leverich Papers concerning the election of Abraham Lincoln and the Secession Crisis is in this subseries. </field>
