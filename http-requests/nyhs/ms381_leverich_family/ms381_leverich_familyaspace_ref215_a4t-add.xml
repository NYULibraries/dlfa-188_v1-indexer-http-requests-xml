    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Business affairs also figure prominently in the correspondence of Henry S. Leverich, the other principal partner in Leverich &amp; Co. The inclusive dates for this material are 1824 to 1877. Almost all the letters in the collection from before 1840 are addressed to Henry S. Leverich, as opposed to Leverich &amp; Co. Correspondents include James Colles and Joseph Lallande, both of New Orleans, who wrote about the sugar trade in the 1820's. Peters and Millard, also of that city, concerned themselves mostly with financial matters during the following decade. The sub-series also contains correspondence from W. &amp; J.H. Leverich, Leverich &amp; Co.'s New Orleans counterpart. Henry S. Leverich's responses to the letters of W. &amp; J.H. Leverich are usually addressed to one or the other of the partners in that firm, rather than to the firm as such. Most of this material is from the 1820's and 1830's. J. Oliviera &amp; Co. of London and Madeira corresponded with Henry S. Leverich during the 1830's regarding the wine trade. Tallant &amp; Co., in the 1870's, apprized Henry S. Leverich of the status of his stock holdings in the Western United States. Letters from other correspondents dealt with a range of mercantile pursuits. Foldered with the correspondence is a small travel diary of Henry's voyage to New Orleans on the ship Frances Fosdick, in 1826 and a one-page journal of the ship Huntsville in 1836.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The nine letter books of Henry S. Leverich date from 1824 to 1849, with a gap between 1836 and 1838. One of the letter books is blank. Almost all of this material has to do with specific transactions in cotton, molasses, sugar, rice, tobacco or coffee. Of particular note, however, are Henry Leverich's letters from the Southern States to his brother Charles in the mid-1820's; his observations to Oliviera &amp; Co. on the Oregon Boundary dispute, the Mexican-American War, and the tariff; and his close monitoring of the rice market during the European potato blight of 1847. Throughout, he sometimes makes passing comments on the policies of the Administrations of the period, and on political events. </field>
