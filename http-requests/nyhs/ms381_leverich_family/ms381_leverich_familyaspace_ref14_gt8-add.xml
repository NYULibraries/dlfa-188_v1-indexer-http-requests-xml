    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The largest single subseries in the Correspondence series is of material pertaining to Leverich &amp; Co. The inclusive dates of this sub-series are 1838 to 1880; the bulk dates are 1868 to 1878. In addition to the loose material, there are three letter books, two telegram books, and two telegraphic code books kept by the firm. The letter books date from 1838 to 1841, 1870 to 1876, and 1873 to 1874. The telegram books date from 1873 to 1876. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leverich &amp; Co did business with firms throughout the United States as well as with foreign firms. While most of the firm's dealings were in cotton, Leverich &amp; Co. dealt in a variety of commodities and had diverse commercial interests. Correspondence with W. C. Kennett &amp; Co. of St. Louis concerns the purchase and shipment of grain and meal; the correspondence of Price, Hine &amp; Tupper of New Orleans concerns the sugar trade. Internationally, the firm corresponded with A. Le Forestier &amp; Fils of Havre about the purchase of wine, and with Chapman, Fraser &amp; Tylee, of Montreal, about the consignment of wine to that firm. Letters from the banking house of Pike, Lapeyre, &amp; Brother, of New Orleans, deal with financial matters. The foregoing material dates from the late 1860's and early 1870's. Letters from Tallant &amp; Co. of San Francisco, from the late 1870's, document Leverich &amp; Co.'s interests in gold and silver mines in California and Nevada. In addition, Leverich &amp; Co. did business with a large number of commission houses, banks, and retail firms throughout the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, as well as in the Northeast. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the material in the subseries concerns the post-bellum cotton business in New York and in the South, particularly Winnsboro, South Carolina, Norfolk, Virginia, and New Orleans. The principal correspondents in Winnsboro are James Aiken, H. L. Elliott, and James Chapman. The principal correspondents in New Orleans are William E. Leverich, brother of Henry S. and Charles P. Leverich, and J. T. Doswell. R. M. Doswell addresses correspondence from both New Orleans and Norfolk. Other correspondents include Henry Cobia and Lesesne &amp; Wells, of Charleston, South Carolina, Duff Green &amp; Son of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and George T. Rogers &amp; Sons of Macon, Georgia. Specific subjects include weather conditions, overseas and domestic markets, prices, and credit. William E. Leverich's correspondence of the 1870's includes discussions of the Oak Lawn plantation and the Porters. Material from George Green &amp; Son of Liverpool involves the cotton trade in Great Britain. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The earlier letter book of Leverich &amp; Co. dates from 1838 to 1841. This particular volume is attributed to Leverich &amp; Co., rather than to a specific partner, because both Henry S. and Charles P. Leverich used it; letter books used by only one partner are attributed to that partner only. Most of the letters in the volume are to persons or firms in New Orleans. These include: J.H. Leverich &amp; Co., a firm founded by James H. Leverich, a brother of Henry S. and Charles P. Leverich; William E. Leverich; Carriere, Darant &amp; Co.; James Colles; Georges Legendere; and T.R. Hyde &amp; Co. Frequent correspondents in other cities include Edward Dawson of Mobile, and Jackson &amp; Todd of Philadelphia. Most of this material has to do with the sugar or cotton trades. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The later letter books and the telegram books date from the 1870's. One of the letter books contains, in its entirety, letters to James Aiken. This volume is chiefly written in the hands of Edward Leverich, son of Henry Leverich, and Charles D. Leverich, son of Charles P. Leverich, and deals with cotton purchases and prices, and credit. The other later letter book is a letterpress book of bills. The telegram books contain messages to a variety of recipients, including James Aiken and H.L. Elliott. These are usually buy or sell orders, or price quotations. The 1875-1876 volume appears to contain some entries that may not be actual messages, but records of transactions that were simply entered in this particular volume. Two code books for deciphering transcripted messages are also included in this subseries. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The overwhelming majority of the material in the Leverich &amp; Co. sub-series dates from the Reconstruction period, and some correspondents refer to political events, especially in the South. James Aiken provided information on elections, race relations, and public opinion in Winnsboro. William E. Leverich provided the same type of information regarding New Orleans, including a description of the White League uprising in New Orleans in September 1874. Thomas J. Foster, an employee of Leverich &amp; Co., described a racial disturbance in St. Mary's Parish that took place during the same month. </field>
