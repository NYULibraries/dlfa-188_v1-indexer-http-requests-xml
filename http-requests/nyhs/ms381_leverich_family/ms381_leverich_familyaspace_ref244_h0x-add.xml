    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The inclusive dates for correspondence addressed to Edward Leverich are 1853 to 1890. Edward Leverich's letter books date from 1878 to 1887, for a total of five volumes. Most of the material from the period 1870 to 1880 concerns Edward Leverich's activities as a partner in Leverich &amp; Co., including that company's liquidation in the period 1879-1880. The material from the period after 1880 pertains primarily to the management of the Oak Lawn and Dogberry Plantations, which Edward and Annie Leverich purchased in early 1881, and to the disposition of those plantations' sugar crops. Principal correspondents are Foster &amp; Levy, the firm that managed the plantations, John Calder of the refining firm of Calder &amp; Creevy, L.M. Ferris of the Burdon Central Sugar Refining Company, and George Payne. In large part, the letter books contain Edward's letters to Annie Leverich, written when he was at Oak Lawn and she was in New York. Most of Edward's letters to his wife detail the day-to-day running of the plantations, including weather conditions and flooding, as well as the purchase of farm implements, feed, and household items. The correspondence also deals with matters regarding Oak Lawn's employees, such as the shooting of a Chinese laborer in 1883, and with domestic disputes among the tenants. Edward Leverich also wrote about his financial circumstances in letters to his father, Henry S. Leverich, and to his father-in-law, Frederick Schuchardt. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes other correspondence to and from individuals and companies, mostly in New Orleans and vicinity. The most important of these is Abe Leverich, Edward's cousin, who acted as factor for him in New Orleans. Much of the correspondence with Abe Leverich concerns purchases of supplies for the plantation and loans for its short-term maintenance. Correspondence with Leeds &amp; Co., of New Orleans, from whom Edward Leverich ordered spare parts for his sugar refining equipment, sometimes contain drawings made by him for custom components. Edward Leverich also wrote frequently to Murphy J. Foster, an attorney, about the legal affairs attendant to running the plantation. Later correspondence includes letters to and from James Platt of New York, regarding the estate of Frederick Schuchardt, Annie Leverich's father. After Edward's death in November 1886, the final letter book was taken over by his wife, Annie. It should be noted that Edward continued to receive letters addressed to him up to 1890, four years after his death. </field>
