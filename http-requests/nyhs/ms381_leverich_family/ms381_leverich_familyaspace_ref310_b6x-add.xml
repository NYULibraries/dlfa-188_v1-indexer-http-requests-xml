    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence of George Payne originated with some of the same correspondents with whom Annie Leverich corresponded. The material dates from 1866-1890. Letters to Payne are mainly from Annie Leverich, written when she was absent from Oak Lawn, and from A.R. Stirling, manager of the Oak Lawn store. These letters have to do primarily with the management of Oak Lawn and Dogberry, and the lawsuit arising from the dispute between Annie Leverich and Burdon Central Sugar Refining. An unbound letterpress book contains letters from George Payne to Annie Leverich (whom he addressed as "Sunflower"), written when Annie was absent from the plantation in 1887. In addition to the correspondence in his own letter book, some letters written by George Payne appear in Annie Leverich's letter books. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">George Payne's association with the Leverich Family spanned approximately thirty years; during this period, he wrote to Leverich &amp; Co., Charles P. Leverich, and Henry S. Leverich, in addition to Edward Leverich and Annie Leverich. Letters from George Payne appear in each of these subseries. Payne was involved with the management of Oak Lawn and Dogberry, and this involvement comprises a great deal of the subject matter of his letters to Annie Leverich. Many of his letters to Edward Leverich pertain to a suit that Payne brought before the U.S. Court of Claims. Payne's claim evidently concerned the confiscation of his cotton crop by the Union Army during the Civil War. Payne's suit remained unresolved for years, and his letters recount its progress during his occasional long stays in Washington, D.C. </field>
