    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Sun was the first successful penny daily newspaper in the United States.  Founded by printer Benjamin Day in 1833, theSun was purchased in 1865 by Charles Dana, and within three years reached a circulation of 130,000.  An evening edition was added in 1887, and in 1916, the morningSun and theEvening Sun were sold to publisher Frank A. Munsey. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Munsey was born in Mercer, Maine, in 1854.  As a young man with (in his own words) "insatiable ambition," he rose to the position of manager in the Augusta, Maine, telegraph office. Becoming interested in the publishing business, in 1882 he moved to New York City and founded theGolden Argosy, a magazine for boys.   After six years, Munsey revamped it into an adult magazine, renamed the Argosy, and now generally regarded as the first "pulp" magazine.  In 1889, Munsey started Munsey's Magazine, America's first cheap general-circulation illustrated magazine, which was selling 800,000 copies monthly by 1906.  Having made a fortune with his magazines, Munsey began expanding his publishing empire to include newspapers: the Star (1891), the Press (1912), the Sun and the Evening Sun (1916), the Herald and associated papers (1920) and The Globe (1924).  In addition to these New York papers, Munsey also owned the Baltimore News, which he purchased in 1908.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After purchasing the Sun papers, Munsey merged the morning edition with his New York Press.  In 1920, he closed the morning Sun, and the evening edition was renamed simply The Sun.  Munsey bought The Globe and merged it with the Sun in 1924 in order to obtain an Associated Press membership.  In addition to his publishing activities, in 1913 Munsey founded the "Munsey Trust Corporation," which was subsequently re-organized as the "Equitable Trust Company" with Munsey as chairman of the board.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Munsey's ceaseless buying, selling and merging of competing publications earned him a reputation as a ruthless entrepreneur, and he is remembered more for his business activities than as an author or editor.  However, Munsey also wrote five novels, and during the 1912 presidential campaign became the mouthpiece for "bull-moose" candidate Theodore Roosevelt, co-founding the Progressive Party and writing a series of articles supporting the former president's bid for election.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In December, 1925, Munsey died of a burst appendix, and the paper was purchased by William Thompson Dewart, president and treasurer of the Sun company and the executor of Munsey's estate (Munsey left the bulk of his vast estate, including his newspapers, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art).  Dewart's son, Thomas W. Dewart, succeeded him as president and publisher in 1944.  In 1950, the Dewart family sold the Sun to the New York World-Telegram. </field>
