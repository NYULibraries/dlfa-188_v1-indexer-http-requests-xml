    <field name="abstract_teim">The Carl Lobozza Photograph Collection spans the period from 1895 to 1896 and primarily contains photographs of Prospect Park, unidentified residences and portraits. Little is known about this collection. What information is known was taken from the photographer's notes, written on the negative sleeves.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Carl Lobozza Photograph Collection spans the period from 1895 to 1896 and primarily contains photographs of Prospect Park, unidentified residences and portraits. Little is known about this collection. What information is known was taken from the photographer's notes, written on the negative sleeves. The collection appears to be taken by an amateur photographer and include snapshots from their daily life. Each negative is approximately 3 3/8 inches square and the photographs are contact prints made from these negatives. The collection is divided into two series by format: I. Photographs; II. Negatives.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Kodak camera was marketed to the public in 1889. This invention, with its fixed-focus, as well as Kodak's photo-processing services, simplified photography. Shortly after, in 1890, celluloid film was created. It was lightweight and durable, replacing glass and paper based photography. These advances made photography more accessible to the general public, allowing anyone to be a photographer. The "snapshot" was born, with photographers capturing images of their daily lives, without formal training. These changes also helped to alter the way photography was viewed, increasing the divide between artistic photography and documentary images.</field>
