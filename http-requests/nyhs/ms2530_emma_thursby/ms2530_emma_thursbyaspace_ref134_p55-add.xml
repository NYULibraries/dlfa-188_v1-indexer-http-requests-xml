    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Emma Thursby did not keep any narrative diaries, but logged her activities, callers, and monetary expenses in many small bound engagement books throughout her life. Many of these books exist for a singular year; it is difficult to determine exactly how she utilized each book (for example, although some of the account books consist solely of lists of accounts; similar lists appear in other books from the same year.) Emma Thursby also owned many address books. Some of these are marked with a certain city, for example, "Boston," in which those named inside live. Others are less segregated. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A case was made for 57 of the smaller diaries, which date from 1868 to 1929, and embossed with the words "Emma Thursby Diaries." Forty-one other small bound books, including engagement books and address books have been housed in a similar sized box. Seventeen engagement books with paper covers (which run from 1900 to 1916) have been housed in pamphlet folders in a separate box with a large diary from 1898. </field>
