    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series 1 consists primarily of correspondence of James Alexander and papers relating to his merchant business. Letters sent by James Alexander (mostly retained copies) are arranged alphabetically by recipient, except in cases where the recipient is unknown. In those cases, the letters are arranged chronologically. Letters received by James Alexander are arranged chronologically. Letters that were unaddressed, but which are docketed in James Alexander's handwriting, are for purposes of this arrangement considered as being addressed to him, and are in Series 1. Letters addressed to groups of persons which specifically include James Alexander are also in Series 1. Retained copies of letters written by James Alexander to more than one recipient are arranged chronologically in this series.
