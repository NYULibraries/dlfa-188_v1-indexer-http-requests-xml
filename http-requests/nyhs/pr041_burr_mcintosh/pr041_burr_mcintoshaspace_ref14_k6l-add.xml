    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of prints arranged in three subseries: Portraits, filed alphabetically by sitter; Subjects, filed alphabetically; and Unidentified Portraits, divided into children, men, and women. The portraits contain many of the men and women of society and the theater community who figured in Burr McIntosh's magazine, including Ethel Barrymore, actress Clara Bloodgood, W. Gould Brokaw (including his home Nirvana in Great Neck, Long Island), Marie Dressler, Robert Edeson, Bijou Fernandez, Edna Wallace Hopper, Joseph Jefferson, Lillie Langtry, Burr McIntosh himself, Evelyn Nesbit, Charles Richman, as well as prints of an unidentified Vanderbilt ball and the Alfred G. Vanderbilt's residence in the Adirondacks. A significant group within the subject subseries consists of photographs of many American buildings, both named and unidentified, interiors and exteriors, private homes and resorts. There is also a large selection of prints of the Taft trip to the Philippines. There are school photos of groups of students generally consisting of music or sports groups posed either on a school field or on the steps of a school building, such as from private schools as the Hackley School at Tarrytown in its first few years of operation. The remaining miscellaneous subjects are the usual as throughout the entire collection, focusing on naval and sailing ships, horse shows, theater companies, and Cuba during the Spanish American War. The subseries of unidentified portraits are divided into children, men, and, the largest category, women, many of whom appear to be theatrical.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is a single print of each sitter or subject unless otherwise noted.</field>
