    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists mainly of the research notes, drafts, correspondence, and pictorial material from Susan E. Lyman's unpublished manuscript about New York City merchant Archibald Gracie (1755-1829) and the history of Gracie Mansion, now the city's mayoral residence.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the course of her research on Archibald Gracie, Lyman gathered information about his family, friends, and business associates, including Alexander Hamilton, David Lambert, David Parish, Ezra Weeks, Oliver Wolcott, Rufus King, Washington Irving, DeWitt Clinton, and Esther Rogers Gracie, as well as other members of the Rogers and Gracie families. Her notes on these figures are part of the collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Lyman's illustrative material includes copy photographs of portraits of Gracie and many of his associates, along with images of Gracie's ships and his other New York properties. There are also interior and exterior images of Gracie Mansion, as well as some maps and family trees sketched by Lyman.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A completed, typewritten manuscript is included in the collection. It should be noted that Lyman's manuscript served as the basis for Mary Black's book "New York City's Gracie Mansion: a history of the mayor's house," published for the Gracie Mansion Conservancy by the J.M. Kaplan Fund, 1984. In a note, Black states that her book is "based on the historic structures report by Joan R. Olshansky...and on the unpublished manuscript by Susan E. Lyman, 'Archibald Gracie and his Mansion.'" </field>
