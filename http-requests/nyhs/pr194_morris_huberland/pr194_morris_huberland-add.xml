    <field name="bioghist_teim">Morris Huberland was born in Poland in 1909. His father, a rabbi, immigrated to New York City in 1920 by way of Le Havre. His mother, who departed Bremen in 1924 with Morris and the rest of their family, arrived in Philadelphia before settling in New York City's Lower East Side with her husband shortly thereafter.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Following in his father's footsteps, Morris spent some time studying at rabbinical school, but eventually turned his professional interests toward photography. In 1940, he joined the Photo League, citing Eliot Elisofon's lectures on photojournalism as influential to his artistic approach. From 1943 to 1945, Morris fought in World War II and continued to photograph throughout his service. Upon his return, some of these images were exhibited by the Photo League, and the artist deepened his involvement with the League by serving on its exhibition committee. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Morris continued to exhibit work into the 20th- and 21st-centuries at various New York City institutions, including: the Museum of Modern Art, the International Center of Photography, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and the Jewish Museum. Additionally, his photographs often accompanied articles published in The New York Times.</field>
