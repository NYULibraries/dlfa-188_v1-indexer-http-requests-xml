    <field name="bioghist_teim">The television show "Law &amp; Order" premiered on the NBC network on 13 September 1990. It would run for 20 seasons, until 2010, totalling 456 episodes, making it one of the longest running primetime TV series in American history. The one hour episodes would open with the discovery of a crime (typically a murder), with the balance of the time split between the police investigation and arrest of a suspect and the ensuing prosecution and trial. The show was so successful that it became a "brand" with spin-offs: "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" (2001-2011), "Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury" (2005-2006), "Law &amp; Order: LA" (2010-2011), and "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit," which began in 1999 and remains on the air as of 2018. There was also a 1998 movie "Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie," starring Chris Noth, who appeared on the TV show for its first five seasons.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over the years, the show's cast constantly evolved. Some of its major longstanding stars, who appear in Burstein's photographs here, include S. Epatha Merkerson (17 seasons), Sam Waterson (16 seasons), Jerry Orbach (12 seasons), Steven Hill (10 seasons), and Jesse L. Martin (9 seasons).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1993, the producer of "Law &amp; Order,"'s producer, Dick Wolf, approached Jessica Burstein to photograph the show's crime scenes, which she did over the course of the next several years. These were eventually formed into a book by Wolf and Burstein: "Law &amp; Order: Crime Scenes," published by Barnes &amp; Noble Books in 2003. In addition to her crime scene assignment, Burstein's role was also expanded to be a unit photographer for the show.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">(The above note was based primarily on information from NBC's website and the introduction to Dick Wolf's crime scenes book.)</field>
