    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">circa 1990-2008</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds several hundred photographs (though many are duplicate prints) taken by Burstein at Elaine's during the 1990s and 2000s. The bulk are black and white, though there are some color photographs. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These are primarily casual posed shots of the restaurant's patrons. Burstein identified the subjects for many of the photos, which include authors/literary figures/journalists (e.g., Truman Capote, William Styron, George Plimpton, Graydon Carter, Salman Rusdie, David Halberstam, Walter Mosley, Molly Ivins, etc.), sports figures (e.g., Keith Hernandez, Chuck Daly, George Steinbrenner, etc.), actors/entertainers (e.g., Ben Kingsley, Chris Noth, Clint Eastwood, Forest Whitaker, Michael Caine, Henry Mancini, Don Rickles, Sigourney Weaver, Gwyneth Paltrow, Russell Simmons, Helen Mirrer, etc.), TV personalities (e.g., Joan Rivers, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Geraldo Rivera, etc.), entertainment executives/producers/directors/agents (e.g., Harvey Weinstein, Roger Altman, Sydney Pollack, James Woods, etc.), politicians/government figures (e.g., Robert Morgenthau, John McCain, Michael Bloomberg, David Dinkins, etc.), among others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although the bulk of the photographs focus on the patrons, some do capture views of the interior of the bar and restaurant itself. Elaine appears in many of the photographs. Staff members also appear in some. The series also holds some memorabilia.</field>
