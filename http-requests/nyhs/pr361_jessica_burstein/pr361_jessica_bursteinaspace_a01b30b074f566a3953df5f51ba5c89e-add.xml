    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series primarily consists of 1000 color photographs, principally of the construction of the new Yankee Stadium from 2007-2009 (most of the photographs are undated so it is not clear if any date from the earliest construction in 2006). The bulk are 11x14 inches, though there are several larger and smaller in size. The construction photos provide both panoramic views of the work's progress, as well as detailed views of particular aspects of the work, such as placing the signage in the outfield, laying the turf, unboxing the memorials moved from Monument Park, and doing ironwork. Close-ups of construction workers appear frequently. While the crews consisted mostly of men, several women crew members are found in the images as well.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the construction, there are photographs from the Yankees' opening season at the new park, as well as some final photos of the last days in the old Yankee Stadium. Shots from the Yankees' World Series appearance are in the series. Derek Jeter appears in many of these photos, and other then-current players appear as well. Former players, including Yogi Berra and Reggie Jackson, appear in some photos, as do other notables, such as George Steinbrenner, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and Michael Bloomberg.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to photographs, the series holds some memorabilia, including a poster, pins, a tee shirt, and some documents.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Yankees, under the leadership of principal owner George M. Steinbrenner III (often referred to as "The Boss"), constructed a new stadium for the baseball team from 2006-2009. Groundbreaking was on 16 August 2006. During construction, which ran through the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the Yankees continued to play in the old stadium, which was just a block or so away. The 2009 season was the first played in the new stadium, starting with Opening Day on 16 April 2009. The Yankees had a successful year, winning the World Series (their 27th championship) in their first year in the new ballpark. The Yankees' opponent in the Series were the Philadelphia Phillies; the final, clinching game of the Series was played at the new stadium. Among the Yankees' leading players on that team were the "Core Four" of Derek Jeter, Andy Pettite, Mariano Rivera, and Jorge Posada, as well as Mark Teixeira, Alex Rodriguez, and others.</field>
