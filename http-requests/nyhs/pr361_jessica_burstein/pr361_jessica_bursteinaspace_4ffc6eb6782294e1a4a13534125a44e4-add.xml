    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds primarily black and white photographs across a range of subject matter. To a large degree it appears that these photographs date from the 1970s and were likely taken by Burstein in connection with her work as a photographer for NBC. In this context, much of the content includes NBC television sports and news announcers, talk show hosts, TV show actors and actresses, as well as musicians, political figures and events, and others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also holds some photos from before Burstein's time at NBC, including anti-war demonstrations of about 1971. More photos date from the late 1970s and up to 2017, and include various celebrities from the sports, entertainment and literary worlds. There are also sets of photographs of business families, likely done by Burstein on a commission basis. Most of the photographs center on people, but there are a few New York City views. It also seems likely that there are some photographs here from the New York Undercover television series and from Elaine's Restaurant that were not boxed separately by the photographer and were not recognizable as such by the processing archivist.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Because of the broad range of subjects, the container list below includes more specifics as to the content.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to photographs the series includes a few documents, mostly related to Burstein's photo assignments. These include a small number of NBC call sheets and cast lists; similar documents related to the filming of John Cassavetes's movie "Gloria"; and teletypes reporting the resignation of Richard Nixon from the presidency. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Finally, the series holds various items of memorabilia, including tee shirts and political and other pins.</field>
