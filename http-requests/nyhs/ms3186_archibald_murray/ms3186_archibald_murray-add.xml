    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection holds 135 volumes of scrapbooks containing newspaper clippings compiled by J. Archibald Murray.  Perhaps most of the volumes have labels on the spines, but many have lost their labels (and the spine in some instances). This description is based largely on the labels; the contents of very few of the volumes were reviewed for this description. The bulk of the labels include the year (and sometimes month) of the clippings, with the general reference "newspaper cuttings" or "newspaper clippings." Some have volume numbers, but not all. At least eight of the volumes hold "necrology" (i.e., articles concerning deaths). Other small subsets are "Buffalo &amp; Pittsfield" (articles from the press in those cities) and "Education, etc." Although the absence of labels limits the description in this note, there were single volumes labeled "Science &amp; Fine Arts, 1896," "China &amp; Japan," "Union College, 1895," and "Clippings from English papers."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the volumes date from the 1890s, ending in 1900. At least one volume extends back to the 1870s, but its format differs somewhat from the other volumes and may have gotten included in the collection over time by mistake.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">J. Archibald Murray (1857-1954) became a member of N-YHS in 1885 and held a position on its Executive Committee from 1913-1932. In the 1920s, he was also a Vice-President of the organization.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Five of the volumes were a gift from J. Archibald Murray on June 16, 1937. The dates of donation of the other volumes have not been determined.</field>
