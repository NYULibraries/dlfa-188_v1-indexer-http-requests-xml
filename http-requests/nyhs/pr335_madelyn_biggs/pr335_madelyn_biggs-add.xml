    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains approximately 100 examples of advertising ephemera, largely in the form of print publication tear sheets and proofs, along with booklets and product packaging, representing the work of commercial artist Madelyn O. Biggs (a.k.a. "Madelyn Oesterling" and "Madelyn O. Hayes"). Biggs created designs for advertising agencies, beverage manufacturers, confectioners, chemical concerns, clothing and fabric mills, hatters, hosiers, underwear makers, fraternal organizations, and utilities. Two purchase orders (Folder 1, below) issued to her by the Metropolitan Edison Company show she was paid $2.50 hourly (in 1947–1948) for "advertising consultation, advertising roughs and layouts, magazine roughs and layouts, [and] finished art work and such other commercial art work as may be ordered" (see Folders 18 and 20 for examples of the work she supplied). The collection also includes a small amount of personal material, and the artist's short essay on the history of advertising (in Folder 1).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Commercial artist Madelyn O. Biggs was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to Henry R. and Adell (McCracken) Oesterling on 16 September 1923. She graduated from Boyertown High School in Boyertown, Pennsylvania, and later moved to New York City. There she roomed at the Salvation Army's Markle Evangeline Residence (1941–1945) while attending the Art Career School, located in Manhattan's famous Flatiron Building. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">She began working professionally as early as 1943 under her maiden name, "Madelyn Oesterling." A note from a pleased officer of L. C. Chase &amp; Company, fabric manufacturers, thanked Miss Oesterling for "a very nice job" that year (see Folder 10 in the container list, below). But in an essay on the history of advertising penned around 1947, she modestly deemed her work of little interest since it kept her hunched "over a drawing table 7 days a week and often 7 nights" (see Folder 1).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On 27 February 1945, Madelyn married in Manhattan her first husband, Alden D. Hayes, and then worked as "Madelyn O. Hayes." In 1948 she received the Best of Industry Direct Mail Award for her work for Willson Products, Inc., makers of goggles, respirators, gas masks, helmets, sunglasses, and other forms of protective gear (see Folders 1 and 12, below).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Madelyn married her second husband, Richard Ashley Biggs, in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, on 19 November 1949, and then worked as "Madelyn O. Biggs." She died, age 93, on 4 December 2016.</field>
