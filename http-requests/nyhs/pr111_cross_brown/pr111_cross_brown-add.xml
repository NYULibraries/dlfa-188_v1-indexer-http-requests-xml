    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Cross &amp; Brown Company Architectural Photograph Collection spans the period from circa 1970 through 1991 and contains photographs, negatives, slides, and documents relating to the company's real estate business. The collection is divided into four series: Photographs; Negatives; Slides; and Documents.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials relate primarily to properties in New York City and State, and primarily depict or otherwise describe large buildings. Attractive architectural views of such recognizable structures as the MetLife Tower, the RCA Building, the Pan Am Building (now the MetLife Building), the World Trade Center, and the Plaza Hotel are included. Materials used by Cross &amp; Brown for the development of brochures and other marketing and promotional tools can be found throughout the collection, from photographs and negatives used for illustrations, to slides and notes for presentations. Materials have been arranged into series based on housing and preservation needs, so researchers should check each series for materials relating to a given property.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Cross &amp; Brown Company was a large New York real estate company that had a "total service" approach to the business. Beginning in 1910 as a real estate brokerage, the company expanded throughout the twentieth century into real estate management, appraisals, consultations, industrial surveys, and other special services. Cross &amp; Brown's headquarters was located in Manhattan from its formation until its acquisition by Insignia Douglas Elliman in 1991. The company's final address was 522 Fifth Avenue. Branch offices were located at 63 Wall Street, and in Long Island City, White Plains (New York), Springfield (New Jersey), and Westport (Connecticut). Cross &amp; Brown was also affiliated with real estate companies across the United States and in Canada. In Manhattan, the company predominantly leased commercial and office buildings, while outside the city the firm concentrated on industrial projects and large commercial ventures.</field>
