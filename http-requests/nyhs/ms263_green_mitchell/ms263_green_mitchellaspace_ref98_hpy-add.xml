    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series 2: Correspondence, 1808 -- 1848</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of all correspondence which is personal in nature or that could not be linked to a client relationship during processing. The material in this series dates from 1808 to 1848, with the bulk dating from 1822 to 1839. The series includes some correspondence received and sent by Mitchell, but the bulk of the correspondence consists of letters received by Green. Most correspondents in this series are represented by fewer than five letters, but Green family correspondence is more numerous, especially that from Timothy R.'s uncle, William E. Green, and his cousin, William N. Green. The largest number of pieces of correspondence were received by Green from "cousin" Lucinda (Lucy) Larned who wrote to him regarding both personal and personal business matters. Correspondence "sent" by Green or Mitchell consists of draft notes or retained copies. Correspondence between individuals other than Timothy R. and John Mitchell is also in this series, as is correspondence involving unidentified parties.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Green's correspondence is foldered separately from that of Mitchell. Correspondence received by Green or Mitchell is foldered separately from that sent. The material is filed in alphabetical order by correspondent, then chronologically within correspondent. Some correspondence is signed only with a first name or initial, so that is used to determine alphabetic order. Correspondence from one writer who signed her letters variously as "M.," "Mary," or "M.E.D." is filed together under "D." Some correspondence includes notes from two writers on the same sheet of paper; filing order was determined based on the name of the first correspondent. Correspondence to Green or Mitchell from unidentifiable (e.g., unsigned or illegible) correspondents is filed after the last identifiable writer. Correspondence to Timothy R. from individuals with surnames of Green or Larned is foldered separately from other correspondents. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence involving Green family members (other than Timothy R.) is foldered separately. Correspondence involving individuals other than Mitchell, Green, or other Green family members is foldered separately. Correspondence involving unidentifiable correspondents is foldered separately. </field>
