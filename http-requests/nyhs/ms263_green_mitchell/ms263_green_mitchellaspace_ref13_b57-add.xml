    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series 1: Client Files, 1812 -- 1855</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Client Files series consists of all documents associated with Green and/or Mitchell's professional activities on behalf of their clients. The material in this series dates from 1812 to 1855, with the bulk dating from 1824 to 1855. Both Green's and Mitchell's professional activities are well-represented in these Client Files, though somewhat more of this series appears to pertain to Mitchell's work. A few of the Client Files relate to Mitchell's practice during his years in Charleston. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Legal documents comprise the bulk of this series; examples of these include court filings, replications, subpoenas, depositions, interrogatories, affidavits, agreements, mortgages, insurance contracts, and assignments. Among these documents are originals, certified copies, unofficial copies, polished drafts, and rough drafts. Most of the client cases concern financial matters, such as disputes over debts or settlements of estates, therefore, financial records also comprise a sizable portion of this series. Examples of these financial records include estate inventories, debt and revenue account listings, drafts, receipts, and summaries of attorney costs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While most of the Client Files have only a few documents in them, several files are quite extensive. By far the most extensive Client File is that of Samuel Storm who was a longtime client of Green and, after his death, Mitchell. Storm was involved in a number of lawsuits related to his business dealings, and his file reflects this. The Client Files of Alexander Brown and Manning Koster are also substantive with respect to legal matters arising from their business dealings. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The estate work performed by Green and/or Mitchell is represented in the Client Files of Henry Oldring, Michael Megrath, Eliza Evertson, and John Geyer, among others. Aside from estate work, other legal matters which Green and Mitchell undertook can be found in the Koon file (slander against the moral reputation of Esther Koon), the Stremmel file (privateering award), and the Farrington file (military service benefits). Mitchell's activities on behalf of the Episcopal Church, primarily in Charleston where he held a position as Treasurer, are represented in the Protestant Episcopal Missionary Society file. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subsequent to Green's death, Mitchell acted as attorney for members of the Green family in at least two matters that are well represented in these Client Files. One involves the intra-family dispute between Mitchell and various Green family members with Andrew Haswell Green over Andrew's questionable financial dealings involving the family farm in Worcester. The second matter concerns the dispute of Timothy R. Green's estate with Green's longtime client, Samuel Storm.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Client Files bearing the names of John or Clarence Mitchell include legal matters Mitchell pursued for himself or his son. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Client Files are arranged in alphabetical order by client name. No distinction is made in the arrangement between clients of Green and of Mitchell; many clients were supported by both attorneys, particularly those longtime clients like Storm and Megrath. Within each Client File, only a broad arrangement is in place: correspondence is found first, followed by legal documents of various types, then followed by financial and other documents. Within each of these broad categories, no arrangement has been established. The Green, Megrath, and Storm Client Files consist of multiple folders; the dates on the folders reflect the contents of the overall Client File, not the specific folder in hand. </field>
