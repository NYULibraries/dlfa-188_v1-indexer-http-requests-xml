    <field name="bioghist_teim">Edward Steichen (1879-1973) was a major figure in the evolution of American photography and exhibition design. Steichen's photographs were first exhibited in 1899 and in 1902 he was one of the founding photographers of the Photo-Secession group. During World War I he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Signal Corps Photographic Section, supervising aerial reconnaissance photography in France. By the time of the photographs in this collection (early 1930s), Steichen had opened a studio at 80 W. 40th Street in New York City and worked as Chief Photographer for Cond√© Nast publications, with his photographs appearing in Vogue and Vanity Fair. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By 1932, Steichen was working with photomurals. His mural of the George Washington Bridge was exhibited at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1932, winning the competition's prize money. That same year Steichen completed photomurals for the Men's Smoking Room of the Center Theater at Radio City.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1933, Chicago hosted a World's Fair, or International Exposition, with the theme of "Century of Progress." One of the exhibition halls was the States Building, which included exhibits by 23 states and territories, New York among them. Steichen was hired to produce photographic murals for New York's space. It is believed that Steichen produced "back-up" copies of his murals in case the ones for display were damaged. The displayed murals were destroyed with the building after the fair and the back-up copies were stored away, unused, until June 4, 2017, when they went on sale (lot 150B) at Tremont Auctions. These murals, along with additional items from lot 150A of that auction, eventually were donated to N-YHS in 2021. </field>
