    <field name="bioghist_teim">The building at 50 East 69th Street, New York City, that as of 2022 is occupied by a medical facility, the Center for Specialty Care, dates to 1918. It was originally built for, and owned by, Otto L. Dommerich (1869-1938). The building was designed by architect Henry C. Pelton of the firm of Allen and Collens. The Dommerich children inherited the house after their mother, Caroline Clausen Dommerich, died in 1943, and sold it at auction to the Henry George School of Social Science, which made alterations. During the school's period of ownership, the house was designated as part of the Upper East Side Historic District; the house is not an individual landmark. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1978, the Henry George School sold the house to James W. Smith, MD, who renovated it for the Center for Specialty Care. Schuman, Lichtenstein, Claman and Efron were the architects for the renovation. John Saladino was the interior designer, who preserved the reliefs, fixtures, stained glass windows, and other elements in his design.</field>
