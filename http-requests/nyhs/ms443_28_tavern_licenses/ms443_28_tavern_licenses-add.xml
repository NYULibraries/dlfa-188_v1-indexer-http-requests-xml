    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes about 400 tavern licenses, plus many related excise tax receipts, from New York City dating from the 1780s and 1790s. There is one outlying exception to this: an 1862 license for a tavern in Morrisania, Westchester County. The licenses are signed by the New York City mayors of the time, James Duane and Richard Varick, and the excise receipts are signed by Commissioner of Excise and Alderman Abraham P. Lott. The licenses were granted to a variety of individuals and pertain to several wards of the city. The licenses of the 1790s refer to the licensee's occupation (often grocer or innkeeper, but others appear as well) or to whether a woman licensee is a widow (licenses of the 1780s have "innkeeper" preprinted on the form). The container list below includes an item level description of all the documents in the collection.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The collection as a whole was compiled over time by New-York Historical Society from various donations and a purchase. All but ten of the licenses were donated to N-YHS by a former N-YHS President Samuel V. Hoffman, on four different dates: 3 January 1910, 26 November 1923, 21 September 1926, and 7 October 1926. One license was likely received as part of a bequest of manuscripts from Hoffman on 21 April 1943 (see folder 3). Other donated licenses were: one by Thomas P. Teale on 5 October 1847 (see folder 5); three by Robert F. Seybolt on 27 September 1932 and 20 September 1939 (see folder 4); one by E.B. Child on 23 March 1933 (see folder 4); and one by C. Otto von Kienbusch on 6 January 1958 (see folder 4). Four licenses with affidavits were purchased on 15 January 1918 (see folder 3).</field>
