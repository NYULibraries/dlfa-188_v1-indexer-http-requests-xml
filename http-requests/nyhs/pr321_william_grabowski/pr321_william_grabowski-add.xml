    <field name="abstract_teim">The William Grabowski photographs consist of about 1,160 color prints of digital snapshots of New York City, primarily Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn, taken mostly between 2014 and 2021. Especially well-represented in the collection are images of graffiti art/murals in Bushwick, Brooklyn and at 5 Pointz in Long Island City, Queens; street performers, theater marquees, and other scenes from the Times Square/Theater District; winter holiday decorations and events such as the Holiday Train Show and the illuminated residences of Dyker Heights, Brooklyn; and a broad range of structures around the city, especially museums, corporate towers, bridges, parks, churches, etc., with some skyline views.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of about 1,160 color prints of digital snapshots of New York City. The prints are typically 19 inches x 13 inches. All five of the city's boroughs are represented in the photographs, especially Manhattan (530 photographs), Brooklyn (268), and Queens (205). The bulk of the photographs were taken from 2014-2021; two are from the 1980s and a few range from 2004-2012 and 2022. Each image was labeled with a title and date by the photographer.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">One dominant emphasis of the photographs is New York's built environment. This is found in exterior views of a wide range of buildings and other structures: museums, Broadway theaters (especially marquees), sports stadiums (specifically, Yankee Stadium and the Mets' Citifield), bridges, corporate towers, airports (especially JFK), churches, and others. Several of these photographs have a skyline orientation, rather than a focus on a particular building. The photographs are generally of exteriors.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the photographs are of particular unique, often transient, details found on these buildings. The marquees of theaters announcing the production showing at the time is one example. Another are the extensive sets of photographs of street art/murals found throughout the city. The murals of 5 Pointz in Queens (destroyed in 2013-14), at Bushwick Collective in Brooklyn, at Welling Court in Queens, and the Audubon Mural Project in Harlem are well-represented in the collection. There are photographs of the Christmas holiday decorations of residences in Brooklyn's Dyker Heights neighborhood. Sets of photographs taken at the 2017 and 2020 Holiday Train Show at the New York Botanical Garden provide close-ups of many of the replica miniatures of buildings shown at the event.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although pedestrians and street life are not major subjects found throughout the collection, one exception to this is the Times Square area. There are many photographs that capture the flavor of the area, from street vendors to the character actors to the crowds to the surrounding buildings and large-scale signage.  The Pride March of 2017, Women's March of 2017, street fairs in Queens, and other such events are also included to a limited extent. There are a small number of photographs of homeless or panhandling individuals.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Finally, parks and other places of relative quiet in the city appear, such as those of Central Park, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Pratt Institute's outdoor sculptures, Flushing Meadow Park, Roosevelt Island, and others.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">William Grabowski (1954- ) was born in Rego Park, Queens and later moved to Suffolk County on Long Island.  He studied art as an undergraduate at SUNY Stonybrook, and received an Master of Science degree in secondary education from Hofstra University, and an Master of Science degree in instructional technology from Long Island University at CW Post.  An art teacher in public schools for nearly 40 years, Grabowski also involved himself with local and regional arts councils.  His artwork encompasses a variety of media, including photography, collage, and painting.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Gift of William Grabowski, 2012 (28 photographs), 2014-2016 (319 photographs), 2017 (393 photographs), 2018 (117 photographs), 2019 (204 photographs), 2020 (87 photographs), 2021 (14 photographs), and 2022 (2 photographs) for a total of 1164.
