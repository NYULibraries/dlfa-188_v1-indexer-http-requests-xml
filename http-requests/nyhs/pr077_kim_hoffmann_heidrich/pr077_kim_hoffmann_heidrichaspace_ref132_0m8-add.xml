    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III spans the dates from 1940 to 1980 and include products used and designed by Hoffmann &amp; Heidrich. The firm produced industrial designs for many companies, including Congoleum-Nairn, Fabry, Hallam Kitchen, Ironmaster, and LiCo. Hoffmann also designed for Grosfeld House, and created a cabinet with copper doors painted by artist Jan Hugo. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes photographs of Eames furniture designs from an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Paintings and sculptures (by Hoffmann, Ilse Getz, Lotte Jacobi, and others) are also here, both as a record of artist's work, and as ideas for home decorations. The folder entitled "Swing Table and meubles ingenieus" [sic] contains photographs of furniture pieces that embody Hoffmann and Heidrich's multifunctional aesthetic. Many of these pieces appear throughout the residential commissions. Likewise, the furniture manufactured by Willow Reed was often used by Hoffmann and Heidrich in residential designs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Folders are arranged alphabetically by Hoffmann's original file titles.</field>
