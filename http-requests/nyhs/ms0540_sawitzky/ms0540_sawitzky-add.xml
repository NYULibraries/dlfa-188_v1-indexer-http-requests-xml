    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of the research notes, manuscripts, typescripts, photostats, photographs, lectures, correspondence, books, and graphic material of American art historian William Sawitzky (1879-1947). Sawitzky's area of expertise was early American art and artists, particularly portraits. His extensive research focused on identifying previously little-known artists, and on correcting erroneous attributions of artworks. Some of the many artists he studied include Matthew Pratt,  Ralph Earl, and Gilbert Stuart. Material in this collection dated after 1947 is the work of William Sawitzky's wife, Susan Clay Sawitzky (1897-1981).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of particular interest are the transcripts of a series of lectures Sawitzky gave while serving as Advisory Curator of American Art at the New-York Historical Society. Organized in conjuction with New York University between 1940-1942, the lectures were the products of Sawitsky's decades of fieldwork and research in early American art. The transcripts are based on notes taken by Susan Clay Sawitzky at these lectures.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">He left Knoedler in 1920 and spent the next decade doing field work and arranging exhibitions of American paintings at museums, art societies, and clubs in many Midwestern and Southern U.S. cities, and studying paintings in Europe. During this period, Sawitzky edited the four-volume edition of Lawrence Park's  work on the painter Gilbert Stuart for the Frick Art Reference Library, published in 1926. He married Susan Clay (1897-1981) in 1927, and she became a partner in his research.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beginning in 1930, Sawitzky traveled throughout New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Louisiana, conducting an extensive survey of thousands of early American paintings and miniatures.</field>
