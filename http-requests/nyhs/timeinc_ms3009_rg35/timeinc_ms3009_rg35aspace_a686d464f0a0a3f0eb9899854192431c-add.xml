    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Advertising Promotion Department Records document how Sports Illustrated (SI) was publicized, particularly to potential advertisers, through awards ceremonies, collaborative events with communities, and the dissemination of sports news to radio and television stations through a tape service and press releases; and scripts of presentations to a variety of advertisers during SI's first year of publication. The publicity director and special events director were in charge of organizing the annual announcement for Sportsman or Sportswoman of the Year, and their files include extensive records on this award. This record group also contains all files on Time Inc.'s test run publishing Women's Sports &amp; Fitness.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Billie Jean King and Larry King founded womenSports magazine in 1974 as a response to poor coverage on women athletes in the premier sports magazines at the time, namely SI. They sold the majority of ownership to Charter Publishing in 1976. In 1979 womenSports rebranded as Women's Sports &amp; Fitness (WSF). Around 1986, WSF signed an agreement for a trial run with Time Inc. so Time Inc. could explore acquiring it. Time Inc. ultimately did not acquire WSF.</field>
