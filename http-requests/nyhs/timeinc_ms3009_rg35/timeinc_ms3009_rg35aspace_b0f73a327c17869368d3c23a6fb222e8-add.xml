    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Files tentatively attributed to Advertising Promotion contain market research and research on various industries along with ad campaign presentations. The majority of materials have no indication of the person or department. The majority of memoranda in the files are from Alvin Buchanan, who signs off as "Promotion" with some materials from Robert Hughes, listed as a merchandising specialist in a 1954 Sports Illustrated (SI) staff list, but promoted to SI advertising promotion director by 1960. The date range of the materials indicate these attempts to attract advertisers happened during SI's first few years of operation. Stetson was the first advertiser in SI according to a speech by Hughes in his bio file.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General section contain the market research along with fact sheets about (SI), subscriber research, speeches, and other collected material to assist in the promotion of SI. General files also includes a folder of all the empty folders retained that includes names of companies that were possibly targeted as advertisers by SI.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Presentation section include scripts of presentations tailored to industries or individual companies to demonstrate why they should advertise in SI. The Pepsi-Cola presentation makes the case for SI as a "merchandising tool."  The folder Richard Neale Summary includes a list of 1956 advertisers along with a sales pitch to be used by assistant publisher Neale. On the Move is a general presentation.</field>
