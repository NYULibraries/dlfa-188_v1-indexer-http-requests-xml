    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes records of bequests and other gifts from 1852 to about 1960. Given that every file in the series represents a completely different matter and that the files span about 100 years of donations, the subject content of each file is noted in the container list. Many of the files include rich documentation including that for many acquisitions important in N-YHS's history, among them gifts and/or bequests from Thomas J. Bryan, Gerard Beekman (family coach), Waldron Phoenix Belknap, Jr. and his mother, Rey Hutchings Belknap, the Gallatin family, John Divine Jones, the Robert Livingston family, Pirie MacDonald, and Katharine Prentis Murphy and her brother, Edmund Astley Prentis. The series includes extensive documentation of the large financial legacy received from the Thompson family estate that was used to expand the Central Park West building and N-YHS's programs and staff in 1937-38. Among the major accessions documented in the series are Thomas Crawford's sculpture The Indian (from Frederic de Peyster), the drawings of architect Cass Gilbert, ancient Nineveh sculptures (from James Lenox), and bronze models by sculptor John Rogers (from his daughter, Katherine). The series includes some purchases, such as the Robert Bracklow photographs from Alexander Alland, portrait paintings from artist DeWitt Lockman, the Nadelman folk art collection, and Leonidas Westervelt's Jenny Lind collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to acquisitions from individuals, the series also holds files on some institutions that donated or deposited their records to N-YHS, or considered the possibility. Among these is the 1938 proposal, eventually declined, of the donation of the collections of the Marine Museum of the City of New York to N-YHS. Other institutions include, among others, the Naval History Society; the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the U.S., Commandery of the State of New York; the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States; and the Sons of Rhode Island in New York.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some files include subjects tangentially related to the bequest or gift itself. These include the exhibition of the Belknap Collection in 1950; the installations of the Prentis-Murphy Collection (1950s) and the Nadelman Folk Art Collection (circa 1940); the 1912 New York State court case concluding that N-YHS was an educational institution for the purpose of exemption from a transfer tax on bequests (De Peyster, C. Augusta file); the financial records for production of the first volume paid from the John Divine Jones Fund; and the successful effort to overturn the directive in the will of Augustus Van Horne Stuyvesant, Jr. to destroy much of his property. Generally the cut-off for this series is 1960, but there are later documents in the series that are included as they relate to the earlier transaction. </field>
