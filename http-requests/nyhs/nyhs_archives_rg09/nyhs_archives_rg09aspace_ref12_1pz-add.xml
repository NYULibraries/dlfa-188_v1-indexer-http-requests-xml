    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Dues Collection Records series includes a variety of records related to the actual collection of dues and initiation fees from members. The bulk includes 24 volumes of receipt books from which were sent notices for payments. Aside from some unused blank receipts, these books only have the stubs remaining, some of which indicate the name of the person who was sent the associated receipt. There are three sets of these receipt books: regular annual dues (1838-circa 1855), life member dues (1847-1963), and new member initiation fees, which included dues for the first year (1849-1857, 1879-1939). There are also two books for Fellows and for Patrons; these have only a few entries in them from the early twentieth century. An annual dues receipt book for 1853 was discarded because it held mold spores; the content of the book can be gleaned from the other dues books of the early 1850s, which remain in the series. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the receipts sent from the annual dues books appear to have been returned to N-YHS without payment. This series includes those receipts, principally from the 1840s-1850s, many of which are annotated with the reason for non-payment.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes a set of small booklets that were used to record monies collected, ranging from 1867-1921, with some earlier periods (1840s, 1857).</field>
