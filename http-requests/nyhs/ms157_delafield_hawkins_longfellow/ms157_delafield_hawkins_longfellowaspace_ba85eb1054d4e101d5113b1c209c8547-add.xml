    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds the content of boxes with an original label of "LLD." It is possible that these papers were so labeled because Lewis Delafield II handled the matters, rather than one of his partners, but many of the documents date from the years of Delafield II's partnership with Eugene Hawkins and Robert Sturgis and many of the documents are on the firms' stationery. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries opens with a set of 12 volumes of case diaries for the date range 1858-1905 for both Lewis Livingston Delafields (I and II). It is possible that some of the earlier files in the series pertain to the legal work of Delafield I, but most is certainly Delafield II. Extensively represented here is legal work for various Delafield family members, as well as affilated families, such as the Wyeths and Primes. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other notable matters in this series include: several packets of investigations by Delafield into the solvency of insurance companies seeking to do business in New York State; various claims against the Manhattan Railway Company and Metropolitan Railroad Company; and Delafield's files in relation various reform and bar association matters. Certain matters appear in this series that have many more documents in other series; these include Delafield's work as counsel to Sailors' Snug Harbor in the City of New York and the case of Sarah May Le Brantz v. William G. Conklin, the executor of the will of Sarah Ann Waters.</field>
