    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds the legal files for the firm of Delafield and Longfellow, and its predecessor firms Delafield and Gould, and Delafield, Gould and Longfellow. The three principals were Frederick P. Delafield, Benjamin Apthorp Gould and Frederick W. Longfellow. The series includes extensive printed papers that were often set off in separate boxes in the original collection (see Subseries I.B.), but the legal files of Subseries I.A. also hold printed papers. On the other hand, some of the "printed papers" boxes held other types of documents, including financial records; the container list provides details on the content of each.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Perhaps more than the other series of the collection, this series includes many matters involving incorporations and other business matters, including securities issuance by corporations, railroads, and municipalities. For example, there is much documentation related to the establishment of the Electric Rail Pool in Massachusetts, a consortium of many street railway companies. Business disputes, often involving Luther D. Garrett or the firm of Thompson, Tenney &amp; Crawford appear often. Nonetheless, estate work and other non-commercial legal work is most common.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some of the files include documents reflecting the firm's office operations. For example D-L box 82.4 has the 1895 partnership agreement between Delafield and Gould and the 1898 revenue allocation among the three partners at that time. </field>
