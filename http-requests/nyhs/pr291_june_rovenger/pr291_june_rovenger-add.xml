    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The June Rovenger Photograph Collection consists of approximately 300 black and white photographic prints, along with a few color photos, contact sheets and negatives.  The photographs include portraits and street scenes in Harlem in the 1970's; street fairs, snow scenes and protests in the West Village in the 2000's; and portraits of children.  A few of the contact sheets are marked with comments, presumably from one of Rovenger's photograph class instructors.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">June Rovenger (1933-2012) was a New York City theater director.  She directed a number of off-Broadway productions from the 1960's to the 1990's, including Shakespeare's Richard III, Eugene O'Neil's Beyond the Horizon, andThe Rivals by Richard Brinsley Sheridan.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rovenger was also an amateur photographer, and in her later years took photography classes at the International Center for Photography (where Amy Arbus was one of her instructors) and the Education Alliance.  From the 1960's until her death, she lived in a rent-controlled apartment on Commerce Street; her tiny bathroom could be converted into a darkroom where she developed her own prints. She photographed many actors and performers, as well as street scenes in Harlem and her own West Village neighborhood.</field>
