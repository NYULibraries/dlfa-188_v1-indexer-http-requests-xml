    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Larry Silver Photograph Collection consists of 58 gelatin silver prints taken from 1949-1989, mostly in Manhattan and the Bronx. The photographs capture scenes of everyday life in New York City, particularly during the post-World War II era of the early 1950s. Images include a street carnival; an argument on the subway between two elderly women; a woman swimming in the East River; a camp for children with polio; people waiting for a train at Grand Central Terminal; and laundry hanging out on a clothesline strung between apartment buildings.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Children feature prominently in many photographs: two boys playing on a construction site; kids having a snowball fight; children peering into a toy shop window; a boy with crutches climbing to the top of a slide. Notable landmarks include the Empire State Building, the original Pennsylvania Station before it was demolished, and the United Nations building when it was a new addition to the city's skyline; as well as iconic locations such as the subway, the river piers, Central Park, and New York Botanical Gardens.</field>
