    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes the correspondence of William R. Stewart and other associates relating to matters concerning the committee, Arch, and subscriptions. The incoming correspondence to Stewart has been arranged alphabetically by the sender's last name. In general, the incoming correspondence to Stewart pertains to subscriptions collected and paid, input on the manuscript for the publication The History of the Washington Arch, and decisions made with the Department of Public Parks. One folder of correspondence from Richard Gilder, the Secretary of the committee, mainly deals with administrative matters such as meetings, resolutions, subscriptions paid, inquiries, costs of supplies, and contracts with particular builders and craftsmen. Stewart's professional involvement with Stanford White is well documented in their correspondence. The three folders of correspondence from Stanford White detail aspects of the construction including differences with the Department of Public Parks, estimates of costs, measurements, models of the eagles, the scaffolding, and the cleaning of the piers. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The outgoing correspondence from Stewart is bound in four letterpress books that are organized chronologically. Indices in the front of the books list correspondents alphabetically along with the page numbers of their letters. The correspondence solicits and thanks participants for subscriptions to the Memorial Arch Fund and details the business of the committee. Other correspondence in the collection includes letters to Thomas Keating from Richard Gilder as well as incoming correspondence to Richard Gilder, Henry G. Marquand, and Stanford White. </field>
