    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists primarily of the artwork and writing of Marie Trommer (1895-1971). Included are more than 500 pages of Trommer's translations of Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish works into English; about 150 poems by Trommer, many of which she also illustrated; some 500 sketches, most done with pen and ink on scrap paper; about 300 watercolor views of New York City, most of which include date, location, and subject on the verso; and over 100 pieces of mixed media textile art that incorporates embroidery, sequins, buttons, beads, metallic thread, and more. These textile art pieces include small chapbooks with embellished covers and handmade bookplates. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains a small number of personal papers; some photographic negatives of New York City scenes; and bits of ephemera that Trommer collected. Most of this ephemera is related to New York City and State political candidates and campaigns. However, there are also flyers for demonstrations and public events, advertisements for astrologers and healers, as well as some greeting cards and calendars. Of special interest is a collection of greeting cards for Jewish holidays, many written in Hebrew. These cards were part of an album that Marie Trommer donated to the New-York Historical Society in 1963, which was found with this collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Marie Trommer (1895-1971) was a Ukrainian-born artist, art critic, poet, and journalist. 
 
Trommer was born in Kremenchoug, Ukraine on September 29, 1895 to Bernard and Betha (Yedlin) Trembitsky. The family immigrated to the United States in 1905, settling in Brooklyn; Marie was then known as Mary Trembitsky. After graduating from Cooper Union Art School in 1914, she changed her name to Marie Trommer and established herself as an artist and art critic in New York City.  A staff member of the Jewish Tribune, Trommer contributed to many other American Jewish publications, including the Jewish Daily News and the Boston Jewish Advocate. In addition, Trommer edited the American-Russian Review, and was known for her translations of Russian and Ukrainian literature into English, as well as translations of American and British poetry into Russian.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Marie Trommer's artwork was first exhibited at the Society of Independent Artists in 1924. Her work was shown consistently over the following 30 years, with exhibitions at the American Museum of Natural History and the Grant Galleries, among others. Trommer specialized in landscapes and figures, working primarily in oils, pen and ink, and watercolors. She also worked with textiles, especially embroidery, creating many colorful mixed media pieces that incorporate sequins, buttons, beads, metallic thread, and more. </field>
