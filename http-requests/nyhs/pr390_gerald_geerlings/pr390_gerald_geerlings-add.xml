    <field name="bioghist_teim">Printmaker, architect and author Gerald Kenneth Geerlings was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on 18 April 1897. After serving in the military during World War I, he studied in England at St. John's College, Cambridge University. The next year he enrolled at the School of Architecture, University of Pennsylvania. After graduation he worked as an architect for several firms before starting his own. His printmaking career began when he was working as an architect. By 1928 he traveled to London to study etching at the Royal College of Art. He won his first award for a print in 1931, awarded by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts for "Jeweled City." In 1933 the Depression and a move to Connecticut caused him to interrupt his printmaking career. He returned to printmaking in the 1970s, producing a group of lithographs on Paris and New York City, including a series inspired by the American Bicentennial in 1976. Geerlings died in Connecticut at 101 years old in 1998. </field>
