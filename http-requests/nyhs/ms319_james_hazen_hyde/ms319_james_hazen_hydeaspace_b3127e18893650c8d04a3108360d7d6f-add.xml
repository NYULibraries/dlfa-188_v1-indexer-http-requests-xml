    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hyde began maintaining a diary in early 1922, and he continued the practice until 1940 when the Nazis invaded France and he prepared to return to the United States after more than 30 years. Filling 94 loose leaf binders, the diaries' physical bulk consists of newspaper clippings and other print matter from American, French, British, and German publications glued to backing paper, sometimes with Hyde's brief, typed comments. A principal example are obituaries or other articles referring to a person's death; on these, Hyde typically recalled the extent of his relationship with the person, his impressions, and perhaps an anecdote. Threaded throughout the volumes are pages with Hyde's daily journal entries. These are typewritten, and references in the diaries (as well as occasional phonetic misspellings of English words) suggest that they were maintained by Hyde's secretaries at his dictation/direction rather than directly by his hand. The pages of each volume are numbered and many (perhaps all) volumes have an index to their content. The entries are in English, except that Hyde rendered quotations in French when, presumably, that is how he originally heard them, and in cases where Hyde used French to better express himself on a point. The clippings and other print matter are mostly English and French, but there are also a sizable number in German.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each daily entry extends to no more than two typed pages, and typically they are less than one full page. The general content of the entries is fairly consistent: an outline of Hyde's activities for the day with reference to the names of individuals he dined with, traveled with, attended a cultural event with, or otherwise encountered during the day, and to his physical condition. To these Hyde would commonly add a brief judgment, such as whether a person was pleasant or attractive, conversation interesting or not, the quality of a theatrical performance, museum exhibition, or other cultural event. The range of Hyde's social connections is impressive and includes American, French, British, and German diplomats, politicians, journalists and editors, industrialists and financiers, military officers, art historians and other academics, and individuals from the worlds of classical music and the theatre. Despite the richness of his connections, Hyde is inconsistent at documenting the substance of his many conversations. He documents various anecdotes, gossip, points of history, and other items of interest he hears but these seem lean compared to the settings and individuals involved. He seems most descriptive when discussing visits to museums, performances and other cultural matters. He seems the most reserved in conveying insight into himself, his business/financial matters, and his opinions on geopolitical events. It may be that the intermediation of secretaries, as well as his status as a foreigner living in France and his travels in countries such as Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy, called for discretion in deciding what to dictate and have written down.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Despite its shortcomings, the diaries do trace the experience of a wealthy, knowledgeable American expatriate in France from the years after World War I to the invasion of France early in World War II. Hyde's observations primarily concern geopolitics and culture, flavored with social gossip. Various observations, speculations, opinions about Germany and its relation to France and the rest of Europe are recorded here and there, and become more frequent and darker in the late 1930s, especially during the German annexations in 1938 of Austria and the Sudetenland. In this context, a notable thread that also appears increasingly over time in the diaries is Hyde's identification of individuals who are Jews; this is especially jarring as individuals Hyde often interacts with in the diaries (e.g., Hans Tietze) are suddenly referenced in that light.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hyde frequently attends the opera and theatre, and even movies, perhaps especially when traveling to Berlin, Vienna, and London. The diaries include many of the programs he collected at these performances. The stage actors Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps appear frequently in Hyde's diary and there are some programs from their performances of Guitry's plays.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In processing the diaries, the archivist skimmed Hyde's entries and attempted to identify any particular items of interest in the folder level scope notes below. The absence of any note at the folder level simply indicates that the above summary likely captures the general content of that volume. The folder level scope notes also outline when Hyde was traveling outside France; they do not necessarily document his travel within France or within a country he visited. The scope notes attempt to identify entries with some biographical significance concerning Hyde. These notes were developed within time constraints and so patrons should not rely exclusively on them.</field>
