    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">circa 1891-1922</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes extensive correspondence, predominantly in English, between James Hazen Hyde (most commonly referred to here as "Caleb") and his mother, Annie Fitch Hyde (sometimes referred to here by her telegram name "Einna," which was the name used on the original files). There are a very few letters that are either from Hyde's father, Henry Baldwin Hyde, or include the father's notes added to some of Annie's letters. There are also a few letters to Hyde from his mother's caregivers, Camille (letters in French) and Rippe. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The earliest correspondence preserved in these files is primarily letters from Annie to Hyde. These are generally undated but the context indicates that these largely date from the 1890s while Hyde is away at school. Annie's letters make clear that Hyde routinely wrote to her, and she reciprocated with short affectionate notes about family updates, health, travels, and the like. By about 1899, typed copies of Hyde's letters appear in the files and for the balance of the files, Hyde's outgoing letters predominate, with occasional telegrams from Annie. There is relatively little correspondence for about 1903-1906, but there are many carbon copies of Hyde's letters to his mother from about 1907 to her death in mid-1922. 
Hyde wrote regularly to his mother, and these letters place on emphasis on noting who he dined or socialized with throughout the week, though the letters seldom mention the substance of conversations at these meetings. Hyde traveled with some frequency and he wrote in some detail about these trips, including those to Singapore, Guatemala, and many locations in Europe and in France. He wrote of lectures he gave, observations during World War I (though, as he notes, these are constrained by the censors), assistance given to the Red Cross during the war, his health, and the growth of his child, Henry. A certain tension surfaces at times in the letters, particularly over financial matters, which include Annie's sales of real estate, Hyde's finances, investments, and their handling of the Henry Baldwin Hyde estate.</field>
