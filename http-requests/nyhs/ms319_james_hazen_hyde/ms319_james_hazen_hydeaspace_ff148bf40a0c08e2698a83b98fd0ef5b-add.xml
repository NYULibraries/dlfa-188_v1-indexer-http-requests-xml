    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes Hyde's incoming and outgoing correspondence dating primarily from his years living in France. Correspondents include both French and American politicians, diplomats, military officers, journalists, editors, writers, scholars, and others. Most of the correspondence is in French. Subject matter pertains to his interest in Franco-American relations, American Field Service Fellowships, American lecture tours by French professors and vice versa, his work for the American Red Cross in France during World War I, his social life, philanthropy, support for the arts and cultural endeavors, anecdotes and comments about prominent persons. Some correspondence dates from the 1890s and early years of the twentieth century, before Hyde left the United States for France. Letters from that early period generally concern business matters.  The series also includes copies of some remarks given by Hyde in public presentations after World War I.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Several of the files include an index card with typed explanatory notes about the correspondent or subject. It seems likely that these were prepared by Hyde as he prepared the files for donation to N-YHS. This view is based on an exchange Hyde had with N-YHS director R.W.G. Vail in 1950 in which Hyde asked whether he should annotate the original documents with comments, to which Vail suggested the addition of typed memos to the file instead. (See N-YHS's institutional archive, General Correspondence record group (NYHS-RG 2).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list includes a detailed list of most of the correspondents in the series. All correspondents filed separately are listed and most correspondents in the "miscellaneous" correspondents are identified. Some correspondents are not listed because their name was illegible or because they were included in folders under another correspondent's name. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">An attempt was made to note any potentially substantive subject matter at the folder level. However, a significant constraint on this was the fact that most of the letters are in French and the processing archivists could not read French.</field>
