    <field name="scopecontent_teim">On July 4, a newspaper article about an 1874 kidnap victim, Charley Ross, causes Hyde to recall that the event had created fear at the time in Hyde's father and "poisoned" Hyde's youth. On July 6, attends and describes Sacha Guitry's fourth wedding (invitation in diary). On July 13, meets with Pierre Verlet of the Louvre, who will be cataloging Hyde's collection on the four parts of the world. July 19 includes a transcription of a letter and related obituary Hyde received from Naomi DesVernay regarding the death of her husband, William, an African-American who apparently worked for Hyde around 1900 and had expressed admiration to his wife about Hyde. On July 28, the Hydes travel to Geneva and elsewhere in Switzerland. On July 30 visits the Palais de la Societe des Nations and comments positively on the building. Had meetings with archaeologist Arthur Evans who was staying in the same hotel. On August 3, Hyde documents his visit with Henry de Rothschild. Hyde returns to Paris on August 23, noting that the German-Russian treaty will "complicate the situation which is already bad enough." August 24 includes a notice from the American Embassy advising American citizens to return to the U.S. In the following days, members of Hyde's household staff are mobilized for war and leave.</field>
