    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1898-1935 (bulk 1902-1908, 1922-1933)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes correspondence concerning the Federation de l'Alliance Francaise aux Etats-Unis et au Canada and related organizations in France and the United States. The correspondence divides between two periods, from about 1900 to about 1915 and from 1921 to 1935. The gap relates to Hyde's relative lack of involvement in the Federation at that time. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For the earlier period, Hyde's correspondence is principally with the officers of the Federation, its affiliated chapters in various cities of the United States, and officers of the sponsoring Alliance in Paris. Much of this earlier correspondence is directed to or from L.V. Gofflot, the Secretary General of the Federation. Among the many correspondents are Felix Weill, J. LeRoy White, L. Fiedler, Henry Cachard, W.H. Perkins, Rene Millet, Camille Thurwanger, A. Bousquet, Maxime Ingres, Henry L. Rippe, F. C. de Sumichrast, Anatole Le Braz, Julien Tiersot, Vicomte G. d'Avenel, Robert Lebaudy, Alcee Fortier, M. Jusserand, George Lamouret, E.H. Goulesque, Frank L. Warren Jr., Camille Gorde, and Henry Bargy. In the later period, the bulk of the correspondence is with the Federation's President Frank Pavey and Secretary General Felix Weill.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The contents are primarily in French, though the later correspondence from Pavey is most commonly in English. The subject matter often concerns plans for lecturers from France to tour America, but administrative, governance, and financial matters are also discussed. The correspondence of 1922 includes reference to the reasons for Hyde reducing his activity in the Federation and his interest in re-engaging at that time.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1902, Hyde perceived that there were various groups throughout the United States and Canada active in extending the knowledge of French language, literature and art in those countries. He consequently founded an organization linking all these societies together: the Federation of French Alliances in the United States and Canada (Federation de l'Alliance Francaise aux Etats-Unis et au Canada). Among the Franco-American societies affiliated with the Federation, and represented in this collection, was the l'Alliance Francaise de New York. A principal activity of the central organization was bringing French lecturers to tour the countries. Hyde became the first president of the Federation and the secretariat was located in the offices of the Equitable. In 1903, Hyde was succeeded in the presidency by Julian Leroy White of the Alliance Francaise of Baltimore. In subsequent years, with Hyde's departure from the Equitable and the United States, especially after about 1908, he was no longer involved with the Alliance or Federation, though he continued to be involved with cultural exchanges in France. In the early 1920s, new leadership of the Federation, notably President Frank D. Pavey, reached out to Hyde for financial assistance, eventually leading to Hyde's renewed engagement with the organization from 1922 forward.</field>
