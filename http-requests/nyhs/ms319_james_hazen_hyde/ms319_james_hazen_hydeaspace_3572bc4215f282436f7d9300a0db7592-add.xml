    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes seven scrapbooks concerning the Cercle Francais de l'Universite Harvard, one concerning the Alliance Francaise, one that has documents concerning both organizations, and one that relates to the visit of Harvard professor Barrett Wendell to France in 1905. The Cercle scrapbooks range from Hyde's entry in the club in 1894 to the end of his active involvement with it upon his departure for France in 1905. The first five Cercle scrapbooks, through 1900, are especially rich with correspondence and other documents reflecting Hyde's deep involvement as an energetic officer of the club and as the financial source for the annual lecture series he instituted in 1898. After 1900, the Cercle scrapbooks are mostly clippings with some ephemera. Nonetheless, the Cercle scrapbooks provide rich documentation of the organization's activities for the years they cover, notably in the expansion of the Cercle under Hyde from a local club catering to its members to one having a national and international reputation and impact. In addition to documentation of the lecture series, including the national reach of the lectures, the scrapbooks document the annual plays performed by the Cercle. Later years include images of the casts in costume. The scrapbooks do not hold any official records of the Cercle, such as meeting minutes or financial reports.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The one volume of material concerning the Alliance Francais includes mostly clippings for the years 1900-1903, but there is also informative program lists and other ephemera related to the Alliance's activities for the first few years of its existence. The Barrett Wendell scrapbook holds primarily clippings with some ephemera.</field>
