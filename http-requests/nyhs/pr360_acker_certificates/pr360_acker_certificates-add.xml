    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes certificates documenting marriages (58), baptisms (8), confirmations (7), and deaths (3). The bulk are of a religious nature, with many depicting Christian imagery and text. The bulk are from events that occurred in New York State, with a small number concerning out of state events that involved someone from New York (e.g., a groom from New York marrying in his bride's out of state hometown). The bulk are from the 19th century, with a few from the early 20th century. Some of the marriage certificates are of a form that allowed for the insertion of cartes-de-visite of the bride and groom; the container list identifies where such photographs are included. Some of the certificates are in German and these are also noted in the container list. All documents in the collection are identified to the item level in the container list.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jon Charles Acker, Ph.D., began collecting religious ephemera about 2008, obtaining thousands over time. His principal purpose was to preserve the documents, keeping a digital copy for himself then donating or selling the original to an appropriate institutional or other collection, typically one open to public access. His collecting focus was on baptismal forms, particularly in the Pennsylvania Dutch tradition, though he also sought marriage, confirmation, communion, and other religious forms, all generally dating from before 1930. The collection held by New-York Historical Society represents just some of Acker's acquisitions, that is, certificates related to New York State.</field>
