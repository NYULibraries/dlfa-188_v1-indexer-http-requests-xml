    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection holds 114 advertising fans collected by historian and gay activist Bert Hansen. Represented in the collection are funeral homes (many of which are owned by African-Americans), drugstores, drug products, coal supply, retail stores, churches, printing services, and others. The fans are mostly undated but seem to range from the first half of the 20th century to the early 2000s. Most fans include religious, scenic, photographic, or other imagery. The later fans include public service messages and advocacy, as well as advertising.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection holds 114 advertising fans collected by historian and gay activist Bert Hansen. About 30 of the fans advertise funeral homes, many of which make clear their African-American ownership or connection to the Black community. About 30 fans advertise drugstores, drug products, or certain medical services, such as dental work and chiropractors. Other businesses represented are milling, coal supply, car dealers, retail stores (e.g., home furnishings, dry goods), churches, and others. Some fans seem to be samples that advertise the services of the fan's printer. Fans characterized by the collector as "modern," that is, dating from approximately the 1990s to the early 2000s, also include public service messages (e.g., railway crossing safety, environmental/clean water), advocacy (e.g., Gay Men's Health Crisis/AIDS), and Broadway theater publicity, among others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the fans include imagery, such as drawings or photographs. Images often depict scenes that are religious (usually Christian), serene country/rural, romantic/sentimental Americana, drawings of products, and others. Some are more text-heavy about products, especially those related to drugstores or later public service messages. Geographically, the bulk of the fans are from the United States, but no particular state or region predominates.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the fans are undated. The terms "antique," "vintage," and "modern" are used in the container list. These were provided by the collector. It appears that "antique" refers to fans estimated to date from the first half of the 20th century, "vintage" refers to those estimated to date from the 1950s to 1970s, and "modern" to those estimated to date from the 1980s to early 2000s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">All fans in the collection are listed in the container list. The donor provided an Excel spreadsheet with the collection that includes the collector's detailed descriptions of the items and commentary on many of them. A copy of these descriptions is included in each of the three boxes holding the collection. The descriptions used in this finding aid's container list were derived from elements of the collector's Excel spreadsheet, along with the processing archivist's observations of the objects. The container list descriptions provide a basic physical description of the fan (as provided by the collector) and imagery, reference to the product or business/organization advertised, and, if indicated on the fan, the printer/manufacturer. The few dates in the container list are those explicitly recorded on the fan or those that could be readily determined from context. </field>
