    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Southern Famine Relief Commission Records include correspondence, business records and newspaper clippings that describe the establishment of the Commission, its internal workings and its accomplishments. Similar organizations engaged in parallel activities are also mentioned, as are entities such as the provisional government officials in the South, and the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. The material dates from January, 1867 through January, 1868, with the bulk of the items falling between late January and the end of September, 1867. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection details the actions of the Southern Famine Relief Commission. It also provides a clear image of portions of the South immediately following the Civil War. Of particular significance are first-person narratives contained in the many pleas for assistance, and numerous newspaper articles reflecting difficulties faced during the early days of Reconstruction and expressing the attitudes and opinions of a wide variety of people.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Aside from social and political turmoil in the Civil Wars immediate aftermath, the South faced other major problems -- significantly increased numbers of widows, orphans and disabled men; destruction of homes, rural and urban; and great loss of such property as tools, farm implements and stock. To make matters worse, a severe drought in 1866 led to widespread crop failures. Much of Southern citizenry was without work and many were on the brink of starvation. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">News of this worsening situation began reaching the Northern states by means of personal letters, agents sent by Southern churches and benevolent organizations, and word passed along to societies and clubs having Southern branches. As a result, a few independent groups began forming to provide assistance to specific groups and locales. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In New York City, private concern resulted in the calling of a public meeting on January 25, 1867 at the Cooper Institute for the purpose of discussing the Southern Destitution and considering potential action. Speeches were made by Peter Cooper, Reverend Henry Ward Beecher and Horace Greeley, and the Southern Famine Relief Commission was established to investigate the facts and take any warranted action. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Executives of this group included:</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over a five month period, the committees met daily, with a general meeting held once a week. The organization determined its responsibilities to be the following:</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During its brief existence (January 25, 1867 through its final meeting on November 8, 1867), the Southern Famine Relief Commission purchased and transported 169,316 bushels of corn. This represents enough corn to sustain 600,000 people for a four month period. The total cost was $206,287. In addition, $12,000 was sent in cash to trustworthy agents to be used in caring for the sick. The group also made possible the shipment of a variety of small donations for Southern relief. Such items as clothing, wine, potatoes, beans, pork, buckwheat and flour were sent directly to the Commission by individuals in New York and surrounding states. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">There were other groups involved in relief efforts during 1867, including the Federal Government through its Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Land. The Ladies Relief Association of New York City, for example, collected $80,000; the state of Maryland, $1,000,000; and the city of Pittsburgh, $30,000. A total of three to five million dollars is estimated to have been expended overall during 1867 to save thousands from starvation in the South.</field>
