    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Ramirez Project refers to a proposal from Samuel Ramirez Jr. to build a structure at 408 Greenwich Street that would both house his family's bond trading business and create residences. Some residences were designed for the Ramirez family and others were designated for rental units. Ramirez had to obtain a zoning variance approval from the BSA for the planned nine story structure because the lot was only zoned for six stories. Community Board # 1, the Tribeca Community Association, and many Tribeca neighbors opposed the height of this building, feeling it would block views from nearby residences and clash with the character of the neighborhood. They also took issue with how a hardship variance could be granted for the construction of four luxury condominiums, two of which would be for the personal use of the Ramirez family. In the end, Ramirez was granted variance approval from the BSA and the building designed by his hired architect, Morris Adjmi, was completed in 2008.</field>
