    <field name="bioghist_teim">Carole De Saram is both the former Chair of Community Board 1 (CB#1) in Manhattan and the former President of the Tribeca Community Association (TCA). Active in the Tribeca community for over 40 years, De Saram witnessed and shaped the development of this historical area. She was also influential in the feminist movement and is the former president of the New York City chapter of the National Women's Organization (NOW). An interview with Carole De Saram was conducted by The New York Preservation Archive Project, which can be found here. </field>

In the 1970s, many artists moved into Tribeca's large and inexpensive lofts, creating a progressive community in a mostly industrial section of Manhattan and stimulating desirability. Around this time, the name Tribeca was coined for the "Triangle below Canal" Street, previously known as Washington Square Market. De Saram became involved with CB#1 and the TCA and helped organize the process of designating Tribeca as a landmark historic district in the 1980s. The area was split into four separate landmark districts: Tribeca North, East, South and West. De Saram felt strongly about issues that affected quality of life for Tribeca residents. These ranged from environmental concerns, noise and light pollution, open space initiatives, and safety considerations. Development in Tribeca saw a tremendous boom starting in the 1980s. De Saram paid careful attention to zoning laws and changes, strategizing legal action when CB#1 and the TCA felt building preservation and community well-being were threatened by developers.  </field>
