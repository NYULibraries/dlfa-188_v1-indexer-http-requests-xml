    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I. Architectural Drawings contains a total of 2,719 drawings representing 225 different projects. Drawings include elevations, plans, sections, mechanical and engineering drawings, blueprints, working drawings, and presentation drawings. The majority of the projects found here are buildings in New York City and surrounding boroughs and towns. Most projects represented are generally those from later in Snook's career. A few projects date from the time of John Snook Sons, the firm's name after Snook's death. Snook's design for the original Grand Central Terminal is only represented here by one large elevation, probably a presentation drawing.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Projects are arranged by size of drawing, and are numbered accordingly for easy reference. The numbers were assigned by the N-YHS staff and do not reflect any intention on the part of the architect. All drawings for the same project are rolled together, unless some of the drawings required flat storage. A list of projects by geographical location, and by date, follow this finding aid.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The architectural drawings were surveyed and inventoried in the summer of 2004. Those that could not be unrolled were humidified and flattened. Remaining rolled drawings are extremely fragile and may need conservation before being viewed. Please contact the Print Room staff at least one week before anticipated visit. Also, the collection was not processed per se, as there remains a great deal of research to be done on each building.</field>
