    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection primarily includes 81 photographs by DeWitt C. Wheeler, a New York photographer. The bulk of these date from circa 1880 and document the buildings on certain blocks along the Bowery, Elm, Elizabeth, Marion, Mott, and Mulberry streets in lower Manhattan in the area of what is now known as Nolita and Little Italy, and along Centre Street south of Canal Street. The collection also holds two unrelated mid-19th century books and advertising ephemera from 1928.</field>
