    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I consists of 1,885 gelatin silver photographs measuring 8 x 10 inches or smaller, depicting a wide range of New York buildings, institutions, parks and squares, theaters, signs, and street scenes. Photographs are arranged alphabetically into the following subject-based subseries: Advertising; Aircraft and Aeronautics; Apartment Buildings; Banks and Financial Institutions; Browning, Irving; Chinatown; Churchs and Synagogues; Construction and Construction Workers; Depression, the Great; Eagles; Factories and Industry; Harbor and Waterfront Views; Hospitals; Hotels; Lower East Side; Monuments and Statues; Night Views; Occupations; Office Buildings; Parks and Squares; Photomontages; Police Stations; Portraits; Public Buildings and Institutions; Rain Views; Residences; Restaurants; Roofs and Roof Gardens; Ships, Boats and Ferries; Shoes; Shops and Shopping; Skylines and Cityscapes; Sports and Recreation; Streets and Avenues; Television and Radio; Theaters; Tourists; Transportation; Utilities; Winter Views; and Miscellaneous/Unidentified. This series contains architectural photographs taken for clients, such as construction progress photographs of art-deco theaters and skyscrapers, as well as more documentary photographs that portray with a touching grace the lives of New Yorkers during the Great Depression. Browning's photographs depict the city in an era that began with a prosperous postwar economy, struggled through the Depression, and ended in the second World War; they document both the glamorous and the destitute environments that existed simultaneously in the city during this era.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most photographs have been briefly labeled and bear one or more of several Irving Browning studio stamps; some photographs also have "Browning" and a negative number printed into the photograph. It is unclear which of the photographs may have been taken by Sam Browning or other photographers in Browning's employ; all credits refer to "Irving Browning" or the "Studio of Irving Browning." The majority of the photographs bear no dates. Approximate dates for buildings in this finding aid were researched during processing and are generally related to dates of building construction as established by the American Institute of Architects in the AIA Guide to New York City, 4th edition (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2000). Photographs in this collection bear only very brief descriptions on the verso or no description at all; descriptions listed in this finding aid were generally assigned or expanded by N-YHS staff and are not titles assigned by the Browning Studio.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Two boxes at the end of the collection contain duplicate vintage prints of photographs from Series I which are being held in reserve.</field>
