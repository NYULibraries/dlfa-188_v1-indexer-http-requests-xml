    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries VIII. Woodbury and Fox family papers (1832-1879)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes correspondence and personal papers of members of the Woodbury and Fox family, including Virginia Woodbury Fox's father Levi and uncle Isaac O. Barnes. Levi Woodbury's letters received include those signed by Presidents Andrew Jackson (1835) and James Buchanan (1847) and by Senator Thomas Hart Benton (1851). The letters received are originals; the letters sent are letterpress copies, some of which are difficult to read. Most of the Barnes letters were in alphabetical order, which has been retained; the 1850-1851 letters were originally in the Levi Woodbury correspondence and have been moved here with their original order retained.</field>

      Biographical Note
    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Levi Woodbury (1789-1851) served as Secretary of the Navy (1831-1834), Secretary of the Treasury (1834-1841), United States senator (1841-1845), and Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1845-1851). The bulk of his and other Woodbury family papers are now in the Library of Congress. Levi Woodbury's sister Hannah (b. 1800) was married to Isaac O. Barnes (b. 1798). Gustavus Vasa Fox served as executor of Barnes's will. The materials give no indication of William Bowes Bradford's relation to the Woodbury family; G.W.M. Guild appears to have been a nephew of Fox's.</field>
