    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of the Naval History Society's organizational and financial records (including account books, checks, and receipts). They document the establishment and administration of the Society from its foundation until it ceased independent operations: its formation, officers and bylaws, membership, finances, library and manuscript collecting activities, and its editing and publication of volumes based on materials in its manuscript collections. It shows the context of naval and maritime collecting by the Society through its officers' correspondence with members and other collectors, authors, historical societies and repositories, and the Office of Naval Records, Washington, DC; as well as the organization's internal governance and workings. </field>

      Historical Note
    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">According to the 1915 catalog of the library of Naval History Society founder John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), "The Naval History Society has been established for the purpose of publishing and preserving manuscripts, documents, and writings relating to our naval history, naval art and science, and the surroundings and experiences of seamen in general and of American seamen in particular."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Naval History Society Collection began with the donation to the Society in 1915 of Barnes's personal collections by his son, Col. James Barnes (see Series 4). The donation included library materials now cataloged in the XN classification in the New-York Historical Society Library, artifacts now included in the New-York Historical Society's museum collections, as well as the manuscript materials described in Series 1-52 of this Collection. The entire collection was donated to the New-York Historical Society, where the Naval History Society collections and office were then located, in 1925. Additional materials were donated by Naval History Society members and others or acquired by purchase after that date, some from the Naval History Fund established at the New-York Historical Society from the Naval History Society's monies.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A chronology of the Society's publishing activities is provided in Subseries VI. Manuscript collections and Society publication records.</field>
