    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is comprised of Admiral Meade's journals kept as a midshipman, including notes and sketches; teaching-related documents from his stint at the US Naval Academy; official correspondence received; letter books and orders from his service aboard various vessels (bound in 1939 by the Naval History Society); clippings and printed materials, including those documenting efforts to erect a commemorative statue to John Paul Jones in Washington, DC; drafts and final versions of his writings on John Paul Jones; other materials related to his administrative duties at the New York and Washington Navy Yards; eight volumes of diaries bound by the Naval History Society; and clippings and ephemera postdating his death that were probably collected by his wife.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence includes that related to his 1870 negotiation of trading treaties with Tutuila-Samoa, and details of the 1883 outfitting of USS  Pinta in preparation for its duty off Alaska. The 1891 copy of "Northwestern Architect" includes a description of the Navy Department's exhibition planned for the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago on page 63. The letterpress copies of 1894-1895 had been disbound from a letterpress book. The John Paul Jones material includes Admiral Meade's lecture presentation to the United Service Club in 1896 and information on his daughter Annie Paulding Meade's presentation on the subject in 1899. The scrapbook materials were found with miscellaneous papers of the Naval History Society and removed to this series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the materials bear a sticker with the Naval History Society's seal that reads "From the Library of Richard Worsam Meade 4th (1870-1833), son of Richard Worsam Meade (3rd), Rear Admiral U.S.N., presented by Mrs. Richard Worsam Meade (4th), May 3, 1934". Subsequent contributions to the collection are documented through 1937.</field>
