    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series 29. Edward Yorke McCauley (1845-1877)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of McCauley's illustrated seamanship and gunnery notebook, kept while he was a midshipman at Annapolis and including notes on astronomy, signals, and maneuvers; his illustrated and highly detailed diary kept aboard USS  Powhatan during its visit to Japan under Commodore Matthew Perry; orders and telegrams received; as well as letterpress copies of official correspondence sent, most while McCauley commanded USS  Lackawanna as part of the Asiatic Squadron. The correspondence discusses personnel issues, local problems likely to affect American interests, and relations with Europeans and Americans in ports including Nagasaki and Yokohama, Japan; Shanghai, China; and Hong Kong.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence received had been disbound from a scrapbook and numbered chronologically in red china marker, probably preparatory to microfilming.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence and the letterpress book (Volume 3) are available on microfilm.</field>
