      Biographical Note
    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">James Barnes was born in Boston in 1809. After graduating from West Point in 1829, with classmates including Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnson, he taught infantry tactics there and then served in the military garrison in Charleston Harbor. At the outbreak of the Civil War he raised the 18th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers and was appointed Colonel, later serving at the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, where he commanded a division and was wounded. He then was in command of the Union prisoner of war camp at Point Lookout, Maryland (see Series 37), for the remainder of the War. His last public service positions were as a commissioner of the Pacific Railroad and Superintendent of the Western Massachusetts Railroad. He died in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1869.</field>
