    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection consists of approximately 600 engravings, etchings, lithographs, and other prints collected by lawyer and industrialist Irving S. Olds (1887-1963). The bulk of the prints portray scenes and events from the United States' colonial, Revolutionary, and early republic periods. These are primarily military in nature, most especially naval actions, with the American Revolution and the War of 1812 being particularly well-represented. Comprising the balance of the prints are portraits of naval commanders and prominent Americans (especially George Washington), views of New York City and the Hudson Valley, colonial era historical scenes, and some early maps. In addition, there are some of Olds's personal papers that relate to his collection, including his prepared remarks for lantern slide presentations of his collection in the 1950s, catalogues, a photograph album related to his wife Evelyn Foster Olds's posthumous exhibition at the Peabody Museum of her work based on images from Olds's collection, and other documents.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of approximately 600 engravings, etchings, lithographs, aquatints, mezzotints, woodcuts, and other prints. There are also some documentary materials related to the collection from Olds's personal papers, including catalogues, labels from the original framed print backing, and his lecture notes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the prints portray naval actions, especially from the American Revolution and the War of 1812, with an emphasis on dramatic battles made famous in the slogans of heroic captains. Numerous American, British, and French prints show such American triumphs as John Paul Jones's "Bon Homme Richard" attacking the British "Serapis" in 1779 ("I have not yet begun to fight"), the victory of the "Constitution" over the British "Guerriere" in 1812, the frigate "United States" capture of the British "Macedonian" in 1812, and Oliver H. Perry's victory at the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813 ("We have met the enemy and they are ours"), among many other events. Views of American defeats include the death of Captain James Lawrence when the British "Shannon" captured his "Chesapeake" in 1813 ("Don't give up the ship"). The French and Indian War is represented; the earliest naval event depicted in the collection is the British capture of Louisbourg at Cape Breton, Canada, during that war. The Tripolitan War is also well-represented, notably with references to the loss of the frigate "Philadelphia" at Tripoli.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Portraits of naval commanders are found in the collection, including William Bainbridge, Stephen Decatur, Isaac Hull, John Paul Jones (often rendered as Iohn Paul Iones), Thomas Macdonough, Robert Hopkins, and others. Some military actions other than naval are represented in prints, including Revolutionary War battles at Bunker Hill, Brooklyn, Saratoga, Yorktown, and the siege of Charleston, South Carolina; and War of 1812 incidents such as Richard Johnson's defeat of Tecumseh at Moraviantown, Andrew Jackson's victory at New Orleans, the British invasion of Washington, D.C., and the massacre of American prisoners at Dartmoor. The latest war represented is the War with Mexico with one lithograph of Taylor's victory at Buena Vista in 1847.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many prints are views of New York City/New Amsterdam and New York waterways, such as Harlem River, New York Harbor, Hudson River, and Catterskill Falls (i.e., Kaaterskills Falls). There are a few prints of other locales, such as New Haven and Boston. There are prints of notable Americans, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, among others; one print of Oliver Wendell Holmes is inscribed to Olds. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are several maps, such as a map of North and South America by Abraham Ortelius (1587); of North America by William Berry (1680); of Wight Island, England (1676?); of Virginia (late 1600s?); and two maps by Johann Baptist Homann (1724?); among others. Unusual formats for this collection include one manuscript letter from Robert Fulton to David Cooke at Pittsburgh, dated October 15, 1814 and a group portrait photograph of the U.S. Supreme Court (circa 1921).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lawyer, industrialist, philanthropist, and art collector Irving Sands Olds (1887-1963) was born in Erie, Pennsylvania. He received a B.A. from Yale in 1907 and an LL.B. from Harvard Law School in 1910. He spent the next year as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes before joining the law firm of White &amp; Case in 1911. White &amp; Case was then a relatively new firm, having been formed in 1901 by Justin DuPratt White and George Bowen Case. Olds was made a partner in 1917. Also in 1917 he married Evelyn Foster (1889-1957) of New York.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Olds was an important player in building White &amp; Case's banking and corporate clientele through the 1910s and into the 1920s, including Bankers Trust, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., and the Foundation Company. In 1926, he moved to Paris for two years to open the firm's office there. Returning to the U.S. in the late 1920s, he became deeply involved in White &amp; Case's expanding relationship with U.S. Steel. In 1936, White &amp; Case was selected by U.S. Steel to be its outside general counsel, and Olds was elected to the company's board of directors. In 1940, Olds accepted the position of U.S. Steel's chairman and CEO. Though the position was initially expected to be for only an interim period, Olds remained for twelve years until he retired from U.S. Steel in 1952, though still remaining on the board. Although Olds no longer practiced law during his years at U.S. Steel, he remained a partner of White &amp; Case. After retiring from U.S. Steel, he returned to the law firm where he served on its executive committee until his death. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Olds was a supporter of educational and cultural institutions, especially in the last two decades of his life, including his alma mater, Yale, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, among several others. By the early 1940s, if not before, he had developed a deep interest in art and history, particularly naval history. In 1942, he curated and wrote the catalogue for the exhibition "The United States Navy, 1776 to 1815" held at the Grolier Club, which included prints of American naval engagements and American naval commanders from his and other collections. Olds amassed a collection of over 1100 prints, paintings, silhouettes, maps, broadsides, and decorative textiles related to the American Revolution, War of 1812, New York City views, and other subject matter primarily depicting scenes from the colonial and early republic years of the United States.  500 of these objects were exhibited in 1951 at U.S. Steel, and many were displayed in 1959 at the Peabody Museum. Through the 1950s, Olds made slide presentations based on his collection. He became a trustee of the New-York Historical Society and was the organization's president in 1962-63, just before his death.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Olds's collecting interest also served as an inspiration for his wife, Evelyn Foster Olds. An amateur painter, she took the themes and images she found in Olds's prints and painted them on trays and other objects. In February 1957, shortly before Evelyn's death that July, Harry Shaw Newman organized an exhibition of her work at the Old Print Shop in New York. The following year, Evelyn's work was shown at the Peabody Museum and, in cooperation with the United States National Museum and the United States Marine Corps Museum, at the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Just a month or so before his death in March 1963, Olds made a gift of many of his prints to his law firm, White &amp; Case. In his will, he bequeathed to New-York Historical the option to select and take whichever items it wanted from his collection. N-YHS selected several hundred items, which were distributed among the appropriate curatorial departments in the organization. This finding aid includes those objects placed with N-YHS's Department of Prints, Photographs and Architectural Collections (PPAC). In 2018, White &amp; Case donated to N-YHS about 120 of the prints they had received from Olds, and this finding aid includes those objects as well.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">(The above note was based primarily on White &amp; Case's history published by the firm on-line at https://history.whitecase.com/white-and-case ; the New York Times obituaries of Irving S. Olds and Evelyn Foster Olds; and documents in the collection.)</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Most of the collection, which comprises Series I, was bequeathed to N-YHS by Irving Olds in 1963. The balance of the collection, comprising Series II, was donated to N-YHS in May 2018 (with a final delivery of objects in April 2021) by Olds's former law firm, White &amp; Case.</field>
