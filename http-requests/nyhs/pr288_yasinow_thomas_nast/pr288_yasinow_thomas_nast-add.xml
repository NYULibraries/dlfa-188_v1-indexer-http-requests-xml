    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Stephen K. Yasinow Collection of Thomas Nast Cartoons contains 71 tear-sheets of political cartoons originally featured in Harper's Weekly magazine between 1863 and 1882.  In this period, Nast contributed well over 1,000 cartoons to the magazine. The majority of the drawings contained in this collection are from the mid and late 1870's, the height of Nast's renown. The cartoons in this collection touch on a variety of subject matter, but are always suggestive of his personal political affiliations and beliefs. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subjects to note include: Criticism of William M. Tweed (politician and head of Tammany Hall), Civil War politics and support of the Union Army, post-Civil War politics in America, the use of the donkey and elephant as symbols of the American political parties, and support for Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.
 
The collection is organized chronologically according to date. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Thomas Nast (1840-1902) was a renowned nineteenth century political cartoonist. His work was highly influential in American politics at the time and is still regarded as a valued record of American history. His widely circulated cartoons are credited with helping to elect President Grant and to re-elect President Lincoln. He popularized the famous donkey and elephant symbols of the Democratic and Republican American political parties, along with the images of Santa Claus, Tammany Tiger, and Uncle Sam. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Nast moved from Germany to New York in 1846 as a young boy. His professional career began at 15 years of age, when despite having little formal training in drawing, he became an illustrator forFrank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly. He later traveled to Italy to report on the Garibaldi campaign for theIllustrated London News. Nast began his career atHarper's Weekly during the summer of 1862, following the onset of the Civil War. While working atHarper's Weekly, he gained a reputation as an outspoken supporter of the Union and the abolition of slavery. Following the Civil War, his work focused largely on exposing corrupt politicians, particularly William M. Tweed, who was arrested in 1872. He leftHarper's Weekly in 1886 and began serving as consul general in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 1902, where he died of yellow fever.</field>
