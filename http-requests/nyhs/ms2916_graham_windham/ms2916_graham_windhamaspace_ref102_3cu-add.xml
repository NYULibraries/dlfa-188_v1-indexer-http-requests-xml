    <field name="scopecontent_teim">On July 1, 1967, the New York State Legislature established the Greenburgh-Graham Union Free School District on the campus of Graham School in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, to provide specialized education to the children under its jurisdiction.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries consists of minutes and related materials of meetings of the Board of Education of the Greenburgh-Graham Union Free School District 1997-1999 and minutes and materials from the School Board Nominating Committee 1996-2001, and various materials from the Graham School 1970-2009, including printed materials and materials that were kept at the Graham School but are related to other programs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The School Board Nominating Committee minutes and related materials are arranged first, followed by the GGUFSD Board of Education meeting materials, in boxes 50-52.  The Board of Education meeting materials had been bound in binders as board packets, marked with the name of Poul Jensen, Vice President of the Board.  The original binders have been discarded, and all materials assembled in binders have been re-foldered in archival folders in the same arrangement.  Most board packets include minutes of the previous meeting, an agenda for the upcoming meeting, and supplementary materials.   
Materials in boxes 50-52 are closed to the public for a period of 100 years from the date of their creation.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries also contains mixed materials (mainly printed matter) from the school including school newsletters 1974-1986 and 2008-2009; examples of student work from the 1970's; a brochure, staff handbooks, invitations and other printed material; and clippings and articles, all in Box 53.  Box 54 contains other administrative materials related to the school, as well as to other programs of Graham-Windham and the agency in general.  These materials include procedural instructions, newsletters, and informational materials. They have been kept in original order.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries concludes with school yearbooks 1989-2008.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Additional pre-1977 school brochures may be found in Series 1.8 - printed matter, while other brochures from after the 1977 merger may be found in Series III.6 - development department printed matter.</field>
