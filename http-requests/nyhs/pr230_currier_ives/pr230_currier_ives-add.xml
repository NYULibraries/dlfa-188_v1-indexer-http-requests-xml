Principal topics in this collection include the patriotism of men, women and children during the Civil War; images of Jesus Christ and Christian saints; Mississippi River paddle steamboats; animals; and country landscapes.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Currier &amp; Ives was a successful American printmaking firm headed by Nathaniel Currier (1813-1888) and James Merritt Ives (1824-1895). Based in New York City from 1834 to 1907, the prolific firm produced prints from paintings by fine artists as black and white lithographs that were hand colored. The name Currier &amp; Ives first appeared in 1857, when Currier invited James Merritt Ives, the company's bookkeeper and accountant, to become his partner. Currier died in 1888; Ives remained active in the firm until his death in 1895. Both Currier's and Ives's sons followed their fathers in the business, which was eventually liquidated in 1907.
