    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Eugenia Flatow papers consist of correspondence, printed materials, published and unpublished reports, subject files, photographs, digital media, and oversized material that document Flatow's decades-long career in civil service.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Approximately half of the collection includes records from her time as Administrator of the Model Cities program under the John Lindsay administration from 1966 to 1970. These records present the entire application process for Model Cities funding and the housing and urban development projects that were part of the program. There is also extensive documentation that provides a preliminary view of the problems, objectives, and approaches in the Model Cities neighborhoods (Central Brooklyn, South Bronx, and Harlem – East Harlem). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the Model Cities material, there are records of Flatow's work in housing and urban development after the program ended in the mid-1970s. The files from this work document her consultancy work on numerous housing projects and demonstrate her interests in mutual housing, infrastructure reliability, affordable housing, and equitable housing policy. As her career progressed, Flatow became increasingly involved in the areas of waterfront development and revitalization, coastal management, the quality of New York City's water supply, and environmental policy.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also holds the records of nine different civic and environmental organizations and task forces in which Eugenia Flatow served a prominent role. The materials for each organization are not comprehensive, but the correspondence, minutes, agendas, financial records, and other materials in the collection document the inner workings of these organizations from the perspective of Flatow's role in them. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Few materials in this collection document Eugenia Flatow's personal life, most of which only cover her undergraduate and graduate school years. There is, however, material from her campaign for councilman-at-large that reveals aspects of her early career, political ideology, and family life as of the early to mid-1960s. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials arrived in boxes that were organized and labeled according to their contents. It is unclear who performed this arrangement, but this order is reflected in the arrangement and description of the collection. Many folders in this collection were labeled by Eugenia Flatow, and all original file names have been preserved. Folders in poor condition were discarded, but many were retained. A sizable amount of material arrived in hanging files, which were removed for storage and preservation purposes. There were also several binders of material included in the collection; in most instances, documents were removed for preservation purposes and the binders.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are 10 CDs included in the collection that contain digital versions of photographs taken at events planned by the New York City Soil and Water Conservation District (NYCSWCD). Many of these files are duplicates of photos found elsewhere in the collection, but they offer insight into the events (most notably educational programming for New York City school children) that Flatow attended or helped organize.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Eugenia Mortlock Flatow (1921 – 2015), also known as "Genie," was an industrial engineer, management consultant, and citizen advocate dedicated to improving the living conditions in New York City, with a focus on neighborhood revitalization, waterfront development, and environmental issues. She graduated A.B. cum laude from the College of New Rochelle and earned an M.S. in Industrial Engineering from Columbia University. Flatow was active in local politics and ran for city council in 1965 on a platform with three cornerstones: political independence, management reorganization, and improved city services. She did not win, but her progressive political interests shed light on the work she would carry out for the next 50 years.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the 1960s, Eugenia Flatow served for five years in New York Mayor John Lindsay's Cabinet as Acting Coordinator of Housing and Development, Administrator of Model Cities, and consultant to the Chairman of City Planning. As part of President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, the goal of the Model Cities program was to improve the social, physical, and economic conditions of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States. In her role as Administrator for Model Cities (1966-1970), Flatow advocated scatter-site, vest-pocket public housing, and mandated locally sponsored community revitalization. In the 1980s, Flatow served for four years as Executive Deputy Secretary of State under NY Secretary of State Basil Paterson, during which she was responsible for strategic state planning, coastal management, weatherization, and community development. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Throughout the course of her career, Eugenia Flatow held several leadership positions in numerous civic and environmental organizations dedicated to parks and open space development, environmental policy, and waterfront revitalization. She was a Trustee of The City Club of New York and Chair of its Environmental Committee; President of The Parks Council; Chair of the NYC Soil &amp; Water Conservation District Board; Treasurer of Friends of Gateway and the Neighborhood Open Space Coalition; member of the Management Committee and Co-chair of the Citizens Advisory Committee of the NY/NJ Harbor Estuary Program; Chair of Manhattan Community Board #9's Public Services Committee; Coordinator of the Coalition for the Bight; and Vice President of the Environmental Policy Forum.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Flatow is often referred to as a trailblazer for her success in both raising a family and maintaining a decades-long political career in a male-dominated field. Her governmental and public service has left a lasting impact, and many praise her for her contributions to the environment and New York City as a whole. After her passing, her son, Evan Flatow, stated in an interview that Flatow was a "champion of New Yorkers."  Her lifelong commitment to ensuring that the voices of New Yorkers were heard demonstrates this, starting with the community participation aspect of Model Cities and ending with the various calls for community input as part of her work later in her career.</field>
