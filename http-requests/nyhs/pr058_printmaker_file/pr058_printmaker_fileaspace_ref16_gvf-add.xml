    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The [Views of the Adirondack Mountain Region], lithographed by John Henry Bufford and published by Bufford's Lithography were commissioned to illustrate the New York State Assembly Document no. 200 which was written in 1837 by several geologists after an expedition to the Adirondack region; here the term "Adirondacks" was first used. These prints are thus notable in that they are the first to show views of the Adirondacks under that name. The complete set of ten lithographed views and five engraved maps was issued separately from the Document in paper covers. Some prints are after painter Charles Cromwell Ingham</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"View of Fort George" (1730-1731), attributed to William Burgis, is the first known engraved view of New York City from the west and the first mezzotint view of the city. This is a unique print, and is enclosed in an eighteenth-century, but not original, frame. John Carwitham's "View of Fort George with the City of New York from the S.W.," itself an early and important view of New York, is based on Burgis' view.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The illustrated broadside, with a woodcut by S. Burnet of the horse Grand Seignior, is considered to be an early image of the first Arabian horse to be brought to New York. The broadside was published in March of 1805.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Four hand-colored aquatints are from a drawing book printed and sold by William Charles, of Philadelphia, in 1815. The vignettes show a country cottage, a stone bridge, a country church, and an old mill. Each print has the name "Henry H. Krebs" inscribed along the top.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">George Ellis, a Philadelphia engraver, completed "The Peaceable Kingdom at the Branch," a popular view after Richard Westall, at only age sixteen.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Henry Hoff, a lithographer and publisher, issued twenty "Views of New-York" in 1850. The colored lithographs were mounted onto decorative cards with a gold border and lettering. Eighteen of these views can be found here.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Jacques-Gerard Milbert was a French naturalist and artist who traveled in the eastern United States from 1815-1823. Upon his return to France, he issued a portfolio, "A Series of Picturesque Views in North America, by J. Milbert, Corresponding member to the French Museum of natural history and several other scientific establishments, Paris, 1825." [from inscription on cover.] A complete set of the fourteen lithographs is rare; thirteen views and an original paper wrapper are held in this File. Several years later Milbert published more prints of America in a bound portfolio with two separate volumes of text; "Itineraire pittoresque du fleuve Hudson et des Parties laterals. L'amerique du nord." Titles on the prints, which were lithographed after drawings by Milbert, were rendered in French, English, Latin, and German. Fifty-three plates were issued; twelve can be found here. A version of Plate 40, without letters, was lithographed in New York in ca. 1821-1822 by Barnet &amp; Doolittle, the first lithography firm in the United States.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Paul Revere's print of the Boston Massacre, "The Bloody Massacre Perpetrated in King Street. . ." is one of the most famous American historical prints. He issued his print less than a month after the massacre, and it proved to be an important piece of visual propaganda for colonial Americans.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Joseph Raskin's etchings show buildings at Harvard University, Princeton University, Amherst College, Williams College, Princeton University, and the University of Virginia.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Caleb Ward's "View of the Spot where Gen. Hamilton fell at Weehawk" is extremely rare. It was first issued just after the erection of the monument in 1806, and then again in ca. 1830.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">James Abbott McNeill Whistler's "Twelve Etchings from Nature," are predominantly views of the French countryside, but also include several urban scenes.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Woodcut Society, an organization for print enthusiasts that existed between 1932 and 1952, published two prints a year. Eight of these prints can be found in this File.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Prints are filed alphabetically in boxes. Prints by Henry Hoff, Jacques Gerard Milbert, and those published by the Woodcut Society are housed in their own boxes.</field>
