    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I. includes both interior and exterior photographs of structures designed by Raymond Hood. Within this series, structures are arranged alphabetically by state and city and thereunder are filed by date. A few tombs, mausoleums, and memorials are included in this series, but the majority of the structures are office buildings and private homes. Three of Hood's major projects, the Daily News Building and the American Radiator Building, both in New York City, and the Chicago Tribune Tower, are well-represented. Some images of the Daily News Building were taken by New York photographer Thurman Rotan (1903-1991). In most other cases the photographer is not known.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Interior and exterior views of four Rex Cole showrooms in Brooklyn and Queens are included here. Rex Cole was a refrigerator distributor, and Hood designed free-standing buildings to showcase the new lines of household appliances. </field>
