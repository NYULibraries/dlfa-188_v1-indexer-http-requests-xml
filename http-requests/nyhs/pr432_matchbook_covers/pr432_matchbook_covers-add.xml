    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes matchbook covers received from three donors in the 1950s. The more extensive and well-organized of the two is the Harvey J. Hess Collection, which holds matchbook covers from hotels/motels and dining establishments from across the United States, its territories, and other locales, as well as military posts, universities, United States ships (USS), hospitals, and other institutions. The smaller H. Maxson Holloway and Abel I. Smith, Jr. collections hold covers from restaurants and other dining establishments as well, but seems to be less diversified in their geographic and institutional scope.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The collection is comprised of three donations received in the 1950s. See the series level notes for further information.</field>
