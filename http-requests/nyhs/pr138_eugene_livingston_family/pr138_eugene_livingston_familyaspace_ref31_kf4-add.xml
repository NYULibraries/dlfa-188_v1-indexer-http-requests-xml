    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series II: Albums and Framed Photographs</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II dates from circa 1855 through 1885 and includes undated items. Of particular interest and rarity are several elaborate frames including one leather, easel-mounted, fold-out book frame; one frame featuring a hand-painted silk mat; and two velvet frames. Also present is a glass stereograph view of the family's Hudson Valley summer home, Teviot (formerly known as Eversleigh). Seven albums ranging in size from 4 3/4 x 3 1/2 inches to 11 x 9 1/4 inches make up the bulk of this series. One cartes-de-visite album has a wooden cover with a carved stag's head protruding from the front; the smallest of the albums portrays a female figure in inlayed wood. Some allegorical tableaus are included in the scrapbooks.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Portrait photographs by several prominent photographers is also included; a portrait of Eugene A. Livingston and his two eldest children, Mary and Eugene Livingston (1845-1862), taken and signed by Gustave Le Gray is included in its original housing, as are carte-de-visite portraits by Mathew Brady. A framed portrait of a print of General Philip H. Sheridan is identified on the verso as "possibly" being Sheridan; a comparison with portraits at different ages indicates that it is very likely Sheridan.</field>
