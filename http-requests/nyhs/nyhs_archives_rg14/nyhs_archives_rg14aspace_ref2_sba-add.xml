    <field name="unitdate_teim">1849-1985</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains chronologically assembled scrapbook pages of N-YHS print material created and distributed between 1843 and 1985. A majority of the materials -- which were alternately glued, stapled, or slid into plastic sleeves -- overlap with content found in Series I, though with some variation. Due to varying degrees of paper brittleness and adhesive deterioration in many of the files, researchers are advised to consult Series I first. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Early scrapbooks are captioned by prior staff, whom also prepared indexes based on lecturer name, and inputted description of events for which they did not maintain associated ephemera. Further details and specific highlights of individual scrapbooks may be found in the container list.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">External organizations represented in the ephemera scrapbooks, many of which held meetings and other events onsite, or collaborated with N-YHS on exhibitions or other programming: Modjeska Club, American Jewish Historical Society, Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences, Municipal Art Society, Railway and Locomotive Historical Society, National Sculpture Society, Netherlands Aid Society, Polish Institute of Art and Sciences, United Daughters of the Confederacy, Steamship Historical Society of America, New York Folklore Society, National Council of Jewish Women,  Society of Architectural Historians, Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, and most significantly, Allied Artists of America, who organized annual competitions for exhibitions; the School Art League, who hosted a medal and scholarship presentation; and the New York Society for General Semantics, who offered a popular seminar series at N-YHS. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The scrapbooks contain a few formats outside the record group's defined parameters for ephemera, chiefly newsletters and press releases.</field>
