    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains chronological files of N-YHS print material created and distributed between 1839 and 2019.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Multiple copies of small-format event announcements and tickets, dating between 1871 and 1982, are stored separately in card boxes. These contain 19th- to early 20th-century monthly and annual meeting notices sent to members, often highlighting a special guest lecturer and presentation topic. Circa the 1920s, announcements and invitations for exhibition previews and concerts also start to appear. Around the mid-1940s, N-YHS incorporated film screenings into its event programming (often projecting titles from its own collection), and began hosting an increasing number of exhibition previews, private receptions, and board of trustees events. Two annual events represented throughout the files from this period forward are the Strawberry Festival, held in late spring, and St. Nicholas Day Festival, a 19th-century tradition revived in 1939 as a holiday season celebration . </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Researchers interested in specific periods should also consult the folder files, where further invitations and tickets may appear, in addition to calendars, gallery floor plans, exhibition programs and checklists, and other informational, educational, and promotional items for N-YHS special events, exhibitions, public programming, development, membership, publications, and library/museum collections and services. Calendars and handouts for conferences and symposia hosted by and at N-YHS are also present. Ephemera produced for fundraising and donor events proliferates from the 1990s onward, including materials for the History Makers Gala (annual benefit held since the mid-1980s), movie premieres (The Age of Innocence, The Wings of the Dove), and other society events held onsite (e.g., fashion show by the design house Halston). A small amount of 19th and early 20th century fundraising/subscription circulars and other documents for building construction, general support, Publication Fund, and acquisition of artworks is also in the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A diverse group of outside organizations are represented in the series, many of which held meetings and other events onsite at N-YHS, or collaborated on exhibitions or other programming. These include the Daughters of the Revolution, Columbia University, Allied Artists of America, Holland Society, Maiden Lane Historical Society, School Art League Steamship Historical Society of America, and the Long Island Preservation of Antiquities. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The end of the series features general information brochures and/or undated materials for the institution, its library and museum, and the fundraising and membership departments.  Other files contain blank postcards, stationery, and bookplates.</field>
