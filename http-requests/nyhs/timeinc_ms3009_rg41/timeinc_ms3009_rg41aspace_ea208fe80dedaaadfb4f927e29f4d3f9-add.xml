    <field name="bioghist_teim">Peter Gross first appears in Time Inc. department head lists in 1978 when he is working for Home Box Office (HBO) as a vice president and general counsel. He remains in this position until 1981 when he leaves HBO to work as executive general counsel for the Video Group. While Gross continues to work with the Video Group in 1982, he changes positions and becomes president of video development. At this time, he also becomes chairman of the board of Teletext, a Time Inc. subsidiary. While Gross's duties seem to focus on development of the Video Group, the department head lists for 1982 still refer to him as general counsel. In 1983, Gross's title changes and he becomes the Video Group's president of video development and information services. He remains as Teletext's board chairman. After 1984, Gross no longer appears on any Time Inc. department head lists.</field>
