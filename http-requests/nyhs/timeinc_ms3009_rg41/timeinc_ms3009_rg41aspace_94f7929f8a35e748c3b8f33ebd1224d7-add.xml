    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Public Television Production and Promotion Files cover the period of 1973 to 1982 and contain a variety of materials related to public television programs that the Television Division of Time-Life Films was involved with producing, promoting, and distributing in the United States. It is unclear who created and used these files since a number of different names appear on documents. Some of the most common names found in these files were Micheal Garin, Peter Hansen, Mary Miller, Rick Schilling, Bill Miller, Haidee Granger, Clare Simpson, Sarah Frank, and Rosemarie DiSapio. At the time that these files were created, Garin appears to have been the vice president and general manager of syndicated and public television. The others worked on public television projects. Included in this subseries are production schedules, project pitches, grant proposals, reports on technology standards, Shakespeare task force reports, invoices, clippings, comments on casting, show summaries, production notes, show introductions, market analysis reports, contracts and agreements, notes, materials and activity reports, list of support activities, project updates, study materials proposals, committee meeting transcripts, Q and A forms, floppy disks, project overview statements, assets and liabilities statements, project flow charts, cross-collaterization analysis, reports on British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and Time-Life Films relationships, trip preparation lists, budget analysis, projected budget, production cost sheet, scripts, and correspondence. The correspondence discuss deliveries, multimedia, status reports, trips, requests for information, project updates, exhibits, broadcasts, travel, contract changes, use rights, agreements, dubbing, recording, distribution, production, technology/equipment, finances, co-productions, authorization, and acquisitions.</field>
