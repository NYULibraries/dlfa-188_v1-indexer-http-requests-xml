    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Haidee Granger Files cover the period of 1973 to 1984. When Granger switched from Time-Life Films to Time-Life Video, it appears like she brought much of her previous work over with her. Since the majority of materials are from the period that Granger worked for Time-Life Video, the materials are part of the Time-Life Videos series. Included in this subseries are production evaluations, project proposals, post production scripts, commentary scripts, press releases, clippings, invoices, project budgets, copyright registration forms, background research, notes, slides, photographs, show programs, playbills, scripts, financial reports, five-year plans, contract preparation orders, contract abstracts, music cue sheet, episode overviews, provisional filming schedules, co-production summary sheets, distribution forms, agreements and contracts, list of contracts, list of corporations, resumes, cast lists, ratings list, candidate lists, invoices, committee remarks, negatives, event schedules, press kits, promotional materials, magazine issues, program overview, and correspondence. The correspondence included in this series discuss production, payments, cash flow, licensing, agreements, revenue, delivery schedule, cash advances, finances, sales, agreements and contract, invoices, production updates, credit changes, funding, closed captioning, television schedules, music cues, approval processes, responses to shows and critiques, changes to shows, film deliveries, underwriting pitches, requests for funds, and shipments.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Haidee Granger first appears on department head lists in 1979 as the manager of public television within the television distribution division of Time-Life Films. In 1980, Granger is promoted to vice president and general manager of public television within the television distribution division of Time-Life Films. Granger remains in this position until June 1981 when Time-Life Video is established. Within Time-Life Video, Granger is appointed vice president of co-productions.
