    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Time Life Broadcast/Time-Life Broadcast Inc. Records cover the period of 1937 to 1974 with the bulk from 1961 to 1973. The focus of records is on sales and acquisitions of television stations, cable programming, and the production of the relaunch of March of Time.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While sometimes listed separately within department head lists, Time-Life Broadcast, sometimes referred to as Broadcasting, and Time-Life Broadcast Inc. are indistinguishable and appear to be the same group. It is unclear why one is listed as a group within Time Inc. while the other is listed as a subsidiary.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Time-Life Broadcasting was originally created in 1961 and was incorporated in 1962. At the time the organization was formed, their main interest was in exploring and research community antenna television systems, also known as CATV. By building this antenna system, they hoped that homes that were too far from broadcasting stations might be able to receive television reception and this wider network would allow them to build a pay-tv system in the future. To make this effort a reality, Time-Life Broadcast purchased Sterling Information Services in 1965. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Along with purchasing the systems needed to broadcast television, Time-Life Broadcast also bought local television stations, such as WTCN-TV-AM in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Owning television stations allowed Time-Life Broadcast to broaden the scope of their efforts and create their own programming. Not only did they have the means to broadcast television but now they could create, produce, and sell their own product. One notable project that Time-Life Broadcast tried to market was a relaunch of March of Time featuring Henry Cabot Lodge. </field>
