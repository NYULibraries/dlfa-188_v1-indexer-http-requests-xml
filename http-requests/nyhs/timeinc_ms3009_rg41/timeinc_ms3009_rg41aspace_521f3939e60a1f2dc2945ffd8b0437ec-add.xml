    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Chairman Gerald Levin Files cover the period of 1972 to 1981. The materials in this subseries focus Home Box Office's (HBO) finances as well as early promotional efforts for the new cable television channel. While the majority of materials come from the period that Levin was chairman of HBO's board, there are a few items from the time that Levin was vice president of the Video group. Since the majority of materials are related to his time as HBO chair, the materials have been included in the HBO series. Included in this subseries are cassette tapes, Home Box Office (HBO) channel guides and newsletters, production rate cards, ad drafts, press releases, satellite network maps, clippings, issues of American Way magazine, press kits, preliminary budgets, notes, agreements, staff lists, project proposals, meeting agendas, cable television industry convention guides and pamphlets, Sterling Manhattan television maps, Sterling Communications annual and shareholders reports, employee manuals, re-estimates, two-year and five-year plans, executive meeting summaries, sales volume budgets, cable television booklets, NCTA (National Cable and Telecommunications Association) convention daily magazine and newsletter, VUE magazines, CATV directories, reports, and correspondence. The reports included discuss the status of projects, subscription sales, task force meetings, budgets, the impact of new rules and regulations, new business acquisitions, Video Group planning conferences, and consumer cable choices. The correspondence discusses budget plans, travel plans, video group performance, via cable work, 5-year plans, Home Box Office (HBO) status updates, lunch meeting agenda, news channel concepts, and HBO News. HBO News was a proposed project that would either be a new cable channel or news show that would broadcast news to HBO subscribers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gerald Levin began working at Time Inc. in 1972 when he was hired as vice president of programing at Home Box Office (HBO). In 1974, he was promoted to chairman of HBO and remained in this position until 1980 when he left HBO to work as vice president of Time Inc.'s Video Group. Levin returned to HBO as chairman in 1982. While resuming his previous position at HBO, he did not leave the Video Group and remained the group vice president. Between 1982 and 1983, Levin continued to serve as HBO chairman and Video Group vice president but left both of these positions in 1984 when he joined Time Inc.'s board of directors and became vice president of strategic planning at the corporate level.</field>
