    <field name="bioghist_teim">J. Richard "Dick" Munro began his career with Time Inc. in 1957. After holding other titles, he was named deputy to the group vice president for television and films in 1972, becoming vice president of the group shortly after. In 1978, when the television and films group formally became the Video Group, Munro remained as vice president but left this position in 1980. During the time that Munro served as vice president, he oversaw a project involving Computer Television, also known as CTI, a Time Inc. subsidiary. This project was mainly focused on installing interactive television systems into hotel rooms. Munro and CTI worked closely with the Hilton Corporation to install and test this new system. While Munro left the Video Group, he remained with Time Inc. and became executive vice president of the organization. At the same time that Munro became executive vice president, he also joined Time Inc.'s board of directors. In 1982, Munro was promoted to board president and Time Inc.'s chief executive officer. After Time Inc.'s merger with Warner Communications, Munro maintained his position within Time Inc. but retired in 1990.</field>
