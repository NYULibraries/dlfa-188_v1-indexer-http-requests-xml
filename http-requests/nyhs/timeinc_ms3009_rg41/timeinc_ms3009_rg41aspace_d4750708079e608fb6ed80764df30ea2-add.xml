    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Time-Life Video Records cover the period of 1971 to 1987 and contain materials from the offices of vice president of co-productions Haidee Granger and business manager Kathy Coraggio as well as financial records that document the relationship between Time-Life Video and companies that the created co-productions with. While the majority of documents were created by staff within Time-Life Video, there are also materials from Time-Life Films. Since Time-Life Video assumed responsibility for many of Time-Life Films' projects once it was phased out, Time-Life Video needed to maintain some of their documents for continuity.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">It is unclear when Time Inc. first incorporated Time-Life Video and made it a subsidiary. While documents discussing the creation of a video service exist as early as 1970, it is unclear if this was a separate organization within Time Inc. or if it they were discussing the video division of Time-Life Films since many of the staff mentioned as part of Time-Life Video were staff of Time-Life Films. Time-Life Video isn't listed as a separate group with Time Inc. until June 1981. Based on evidence found with this record group, it appears that Time-Life Video was made into a separate organization as Time-Life Films was being phased out. As part of this phase out, Time-Life Video took on many of the projects that Time-Life Films had been working on. </field>
