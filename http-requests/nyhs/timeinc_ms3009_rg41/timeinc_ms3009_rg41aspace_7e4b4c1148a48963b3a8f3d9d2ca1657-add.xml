    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Time-Life Films: Multimedia Division Records cover the period of 1966 to 1977 with the bulk covering the period of 1974 to 1975. The focus of this series is on the production of educational kits that Time-Life films distributed and sold to schools and universities. Included in this subseries are clippings, bibliographies, teaching guides, drafts of guides, notes, episode overviews, sound scripts, overdue transparencies forms, cue sheets, film lists, shooting masters, filmstrip reports, frame lists, scripts, personnel lists, photograph order forms, invoices, project overviews, story boards, catalog listings, program guides, agreements, and correspondence. The Correspondence discuss comments on scripts, production of films, filmstrips, transparencies, payments, photographs, scripts, language levels, content issues, agreements, and reproduction. Additionally, there are two multimedia kits that are examples of the materials that were distributed and sold to schools and universities.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Multimedia Division of Time-Life Films is first mentioned in department head lists in 1978. The following year, the division is no longer listed and appears to have been absorbed by the Video Enterprise Division. While department head lists offer little information, the materials within this series imply that the division existed before 1978. The main purpose of this division was to create educational kits that could be used in classrooms.</field>
