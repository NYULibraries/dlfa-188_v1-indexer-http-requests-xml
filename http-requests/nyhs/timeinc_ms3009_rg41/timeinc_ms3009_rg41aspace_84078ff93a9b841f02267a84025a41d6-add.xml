    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Time-Life Films: Television Records cover the period of 1939 to 1985 with the bulk of the materials covering the period of 1973 to 1982. Materials dated prior to 1970 are mainly photocopies of materials used for research. The focus of the materials in this series is on the production of television projects and on the financial relationship that existed between Time-Life Films and the companies that they were creating co-productions with.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Time-Life Films was incorporated by Time Inc. in 1958. While the company was created at that time, Time-Life Films doesn't become a fully subsidiary of Time Inc. until December 1969 when Time-Life Films purchases the Peter M. Robeck and Company. Peter Robeck, the former owner of Peter M. Robeck and Company, is appointed as the managing director of Time-Life Films. This new subsidiary handles the sales of distribution of films within the United States with a focus on distributing materials created by the British Broadcasting Company (BBC). </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">At the time that Time-Life Films purchased Peter M. Robeck and Company, it began working on television productions. Initially, these television productions were considered to part of the non-theatric division of the subsidiary. While Time-Life Films had divisions internally, the different sections of the organization weren't listed in department head lists until 1974. Internally, Time-Life Films names its divisions education, video, and non-theatric divisions but on department head lists the divisions are production, marketing, and business affairs. The divisions named on the department head lists appear to have been administrative in nature and to have overseen the work done by the internal division. The department head lists do not begin to reflect the group's internal organization until 1978 when the Television Division is listed for the first time.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over the course of Time-Life Films existence, the Television Division had a variety of names. Between 1972 and 1974, the division is called the Non-Theatric Division then, partially through 1974, the name is changed to the Television Division. This name is kept until at least November 1978 when the name changes to the Television Distribution Division. This name is in use until 1981 when the Television Division is reinstated. After 1982, Time-Life Films appears sporadically in department head lists. </field>
