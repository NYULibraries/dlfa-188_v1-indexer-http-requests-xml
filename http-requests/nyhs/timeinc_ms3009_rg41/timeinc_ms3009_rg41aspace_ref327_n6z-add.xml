Sterling, under the leadership of its founder, Charles F. Dolan, was the first company to enter the cable field in New York City in 1962 when it began wiring hotels throughout Manhattan to broadcast informational programming. In 1965 Sterling Information Services, Ltd received a franchise to provide CATV in Manhattan from 86th Street on the East side and 79th Street on the West side all the way to the Battery under its Sterling Manhattan Cable Television (SMCTV) subsidiary.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During its years of operation Sterling secured the rights to broadcast New York Knicks basketball and New York Rangers home games on SMCTV and established Home Box Office (HBO) pay channel in 1972. In 1973 Time Inc. took over Sterling Communications, Inc., dissolving the company and selling most of its assets. Two of Sterling's subsidiaries, HBO and SMCTV, became wholly owned subsidiaries of Time, Inc. and were placed under the Time-Life Cable Communications unit. SMCTV was subsequently renamed Manhattan Cable Television (MCTV).</field>
