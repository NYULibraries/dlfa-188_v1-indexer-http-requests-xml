    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Vice President Gerald Levin Files cover the period of 1979 to 1983 and focus on the finances and operations of the Video Group and the companies within it. While Levin mainly served as Video Group vice president during this period, he also served as Home Box Office (HBO) chairman from 1974 to 1979 and 1982 to 1983. Since the majority of materials focus on his work as Video Group vice president, these materials have their own series rather than being included with his HBO-focused materials. Included in this series are special equities investment reports, memoranda on the sale of WOTV stations, financial statements, re-estimate reports, financial reports, Grand Rapids Broadcast Division and Time-Life Broadcast financial reports, press releases, agreements, revenue reports, balance sheets, event booklets, legal filings, clippings, press kits, annual securities reports on American Family Corporation, reports on retirement income plans, Time-Life Broadcast strategic plans, WOTV transmitter review reports, Time-Life Films budgets, TV Cable Week reports, issues of TV Cable Week, lists of presentation attendees, magazine prototypes, outlines of acquisition deals, presentation pamphlets, lists of employee contracts, clippings, profit and loss statements, non-theatric market reports, presentation outlines, Search for Alexander the Great scripts, and correspondence. The correspondence included in this series discuss bonuses, appropriations, the sale and purchase of WOTV, finances, revenue, sales, national cable convention, budgets, project pitch, new acquisitions, contract modification proposals, contract terminations, five-year plans, monthly and weekly activity updates,  operating incomes, project overviews, project reviews, and distribution plan.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gerald Levin began working at Time Inc. in 1972 when he was hired as vice president of programing at Home Box Office (HBO) which was a premium subscription cable channel. In 1974, he was promoted to chairman of HBO and remained in this position until 1980 when he left HBO to work as vice president of Time Inc.'s Video Group. Levin returned to HBO as chairman in 1982. While resuming his previous position at HBO, he did not leave the Video Group and remained the group vice president. Between 1982 and 1983, Levin continued to serve as HBO chairman and Video Group vice president but left both of these positions in 1984 when he joined Time Inc.'s board of directors and became vice president of strategic planning at the corporate level.</field>
