    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Kathy Coraggio Files cover the period of 1971 to 1987 and focus on her work as the business manager of Time-Life Video. While there are documents from her time as the manager of accounting for the Video Group, the majority of documents do not focus on that work. Additionally, there are some materials that originate from Time-Life Films, these documents are present since Time-Life Video took over many of Time-Life Film's responsibilities when it was phased out. Included in this subseries are agreements, notes, distribution forms, contract overview forms, co-production forms, license agreements overviews, clearance history sheets, re-run analysis, list of air dates, financial analysis, lists of shows and revenue, list of payments, rights evaluations, distribution reports, sales history reports, notes, invoices, check requisition forms, list of contracts, bookkeeping journal entries, financial reports, list of receipts, contract abstracts, profit and loss worksheets, profit participation formula sheets, and correspondence. The correspondence discusses cable sales candidates, agreements, delivery schedule, and costs.</field>
