    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Time-Life Home Video Service was first proposed in 1978 as subscription service that would distribute and sell pre-recorded and blank video cassettes to private consumers. The service was officially launched in 1979 as the Time-Life Video Club. At the time the service officially launched, the Video Division decided to follow the model used by the Book-of-the-Month Club, another subsidiary of Time Inc., and only distribute pre-recorded content. The content offered included feature films, dramas, comedies, children's' shows, sports, and how-to's. Much of the advertising and launch campaign for this service was handled by the Book-of-the-Month Club. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After the service's launch, the Time-Life Video Club was faced with a variety of problems. One of the main issues was that the service could not secure the rights to enough lucrative films. Without these titles, the Time-Life Video Club was not able to promote the service in the way that they had originally planned leading to unfavorable sales. Due to these issues, Time Inc. sold the Video Club to Vestron Inc. in 1981.</field>
