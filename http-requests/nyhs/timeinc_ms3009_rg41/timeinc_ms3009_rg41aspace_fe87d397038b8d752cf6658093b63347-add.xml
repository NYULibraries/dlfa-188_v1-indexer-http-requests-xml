    <field name="bioghist_teim">E. Gabriel Perle began working at Time Inc. in 1964 as an assistant to the editorial counsel at the corporate level. By 1966, Perle was promoted publishing counsel within the corporate group. Perle remained in this position until at least 1972 when he was listed in the department head list as one of two members of the legal department under Charles Bear, the vice president and secretary of administration and international affairs within the corporate group. In 1974, Perle was still working within the corporate group but in the legal department under the group vice president and secretary Charles Bear. While still being at the corporate level, Perle oversaw the legal affairs for various groups within Time Inc. that did not have their own dedicated legal counsel. One such group was the Video Group. Within Perle's own files, he is referred to as the publishing and legal counsel for the Video Group. Perle remained in this position until 1980 when a dedicated legal department is set up at the corporate level. At this point, Perle became vice president of law and the head of the legal department. Perle remained with Time Inc. until 1984 when he no longer appears in department head lists. </field>
