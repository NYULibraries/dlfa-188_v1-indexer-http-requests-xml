    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The H.N. Tiemann &amp; Co. Photograph Collection spans the period from ca. 1880 to 1916 and contains 283 black and white negatives (measuring 8 x 10 inches) of views of prominent Manhattan locations. Most negatives are glass, but a few film negatives are included. Negatives are filed by Tiemann's stock numbers. The collection was purchased as a discrete group of 480 negatives in 1952 and was originally integrated into the Negative File (PR 045). Some of the negatives were filed without indication of their creator and remain in the Negative File. Gaps in the numbering sequence reflect the existence of those negatives. Some of the images in this collection were cataloged individually for inclusion in the department's in-house card catalog; they were originally assigned numbers consisting of the prefix 63200- followed by the Tiemann stock number. Most negatives bear Tiemann's imprint, "THE H.N. TIEMANN CO. NEW YORK CITY" or are marked with the firm's distinctive numbering. Titles in this finding aid represent the captions which were handwritten or stamped onto the negatives with abbreviations left intact; titles in brackets have been supplied by N-YHS staff. Dates reflect Tiemann's as they are written on the negatives; dates in brackets have been provided by N-YHS staff.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Negatives in this collection portray Manhattan streets, buildings, hotels, churches, residences and landmarks. Most views are of prominent locations, tourist attractions, grand architecture, or fashionable street views. However, some photographs of shanties show a less glamorous Manhattan at the turn of the 20th Century. Among heavily represented subjects are the 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration, Queensboro Bridge, Croton Reservoir, Fifth Avenue, the Flatiron Building, the American Museum of Natural History, Grand Central Terminal, Madison Square Garden and Union Square. Photographs of residences include those of notable New Yorkers A.T. Stewart, Harry F. Sinclair, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and Gouverneur Morris, Jr. A few photographs depict scenes outside of New York City, including one copy negative of a photograph of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. and a view of a military camp in Peekskill, New York.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included in the collection are numerous copy negatives of engravings, lithographs, and photographs by other artists, many of which depict earlier views of Manhattan. Copies of photographs by Irving Underhill, J.S. Johnston, and Joseph Hall are present in the collection; most original photographers represented have not been identified. Copy negatives of lithographs by W.C. Rogers &amp; Co. and G. Hayward are included.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">H.N. Tiemann &amp; Co. was a Manhattan-based commercial photography company which primarily recorded prominent New York buildings, bridges, civic celebrations, and fashionable street scenes for publication or general sale beginning in the 1890s. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hermann Newell Tiemann (1863-1957), founder and president of H.N. Tiemann &amp; Co., was born in New York on February 2, 1863. His father, Julius William Tiemann, was the brother of New York City Mayor Daniel F. Tiemann and a partner in D.F. Tiemann &amp; Co. paint manufacturers in Manhattanville. His mother was Julius Tiemann's second wife, Marie Antoinette Megie of Brooklyn. Hermann Tiemann married Belle Louise Minor in her hometown of Newtown, Connecticut on June 22 1892. He lived with his family in Connecticut from 1905 until his death in 1957, although his business remained in New York City through 1948. His name is often misspelled as "Herman", without the final "n", in city directories and other publications.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Trow's New York City Directory of 1891 lists Hermann Tiemann as a commercial photographer, but he was already active as an amateur by 1885 when he showed his work in the First Annual Exhibition of the Society of Amateur Photographers of New York. Tiemann continued to exhibit through the Society of Amateur Photographers of New York and then as a member of the Camera Club of New York throughout the 1880s and 1890s.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Tiemann's first studio opened at 13 West 42nd Street in Manhattan; it moved to number 19 and then 17 West 42nd Street between 1893 and 1898. From 1904 to 1919, H.N. Tiemann &amp; Co. was located at 4 East 30th Street, moving in 1920 to 176 Lexington Avenue where it remained until 1948, the year of the firm's presumed dissolution (when the firm ceased appearing in directories). Beginnning 1920, directories list the firm as a purveyor of photographic supplies. Hermann Tiemann died in Connecticut in 1957 at the age of 94.</field>
