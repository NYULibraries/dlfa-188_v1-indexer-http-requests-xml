    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II. Archive material includes material from Stummer's archive of the East 6th Street photography project. This includes contact sheets, slides, audiotapes, a 9 minute U-Matic cartridge "Children of East 6th Street" (which seems to be of still images), and a handmade artist's book of photographs and reminiscences of the project. This material spans the period from 1976 to 1984. The series also includes a manuscript memoir by Stummer titled "Risking Life and Lens: How I Photographed the Meanest Street in America and Why."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">One hundred and sixty printed contact sheets document the entirety of the images taken by Stummer on East 6th Street. Stummer's notes, as well as dates, are recorded on most of these. One hundred and sixty one slides, both black and white and Ektachrome, represent a selection of the images. Few are dated or labeled. The ten audiotapes include several that Stummer recorded of ambient noise on the block while she was taking photographs. It also includes a tape of her narration to a slide show of photos of East 6th Street. Several tapes are oral histories and interviews between Stummer and East 6th Street residents. One tape is an oral history interview with Irwin Silver concerning the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.</field>
