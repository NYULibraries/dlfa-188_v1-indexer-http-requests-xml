    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Helen M. Stummer Photographs and Papers span the period from 1976 to 2001 and primarily contains photographs taken on East 6th Street in New York City. The collection also holds some of the photographer's archive relating to these photographs, including audiocassettes, a videocassette, an artist's book and a memoir. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While Stummer was enrolled in photography classes at the International Center for Photography, she was encouraged to continue an earlier interest in photographing children. She arranged to go to the Children's Aid Society's Sloane Center on East 6th Street between Avenues B and C. At that time the street was considered part of the Lower East Side neighborhood, and was inhabited mainly by poor Puerto Rican and African American families. Stummer photographed children both inside the Center and outside on the streets. Over the course of several years, she befriended many East 6th Street residents, and photographed important events in their lives. She also conducted oral interviews with some of the people she met and photographed.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Helen M. Stummer was born in 1936. She holds a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Kean College, and a masters degree in Visual Sociology from Vermont College. Before becoming a photographer, Stummer was a painter. She began taking photographs in 1975, enrolling in classes at the International Center for Photography in New York City, in order to better document subjects for her paintings. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Stummer considers herself a Visual Sociologist. She has focused her camera on photographing economically disadvantaged communities, both in urban and rural settings. In addition to the photographs taken on East 6th Street found in this collection, she has documented inhabitants of the city of Newark, New Jersey, as well as communities in rural Maine and in Guatemala.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Stummer's photographs have been widely published and exhibited. More information on Stummer can be found on her website, www.hmstummer.com.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">In 2003 a total of 22 photographs were acquired from the photographer in a combined purchase/donation transaction. Additional images and other documentary material were donated by the photographer in August 2008. A memoir was added in March 2013.</field>
