    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes files related to projects from the 1990s-early 2000s during which time archival material was compiled by the Hort and used to create ready reference resources for internal and external inquiries about the organization. The name Joan Nichols appears often in these files; Joan appears to have been the volunteer primarily responsible for implementing the archives initiative, under the direction of Librarian Katherine Powis. During processing of the collection at N-YHS in 2017, much of the original material compiled was sorted into various series (e.g., Flower Show, Print Matter, etc.). However, some material could not be readily sorted and so was kept together in this subseries. Consequently, the subseries includes a wide range of documents related to Hort's programs and administration. Most of the original material in the subseries dates from the 1980s-2000s, though there are a few earlier original pieces. Much of the subseries includes photocopies of historical documents (e.g., officer lists from annual reports of various years). The date range used in the container list refers to original documents, not the dates of photocopied material.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Several of the folders in the subseries with original documents relate to the Hort's public education programs of the 1980s-2000s. Among these were Greenworks (later, GreenHouse), which was vocational training for inmates at Rikers Island; Green Team, which trained at-risk youth in greening projects in public spaces; GreenBranches, which installed gardens around selected branch libraries; Apple Seed, which was an environmental and science education program for the third through sixth grades; and other urban horticulture, community gardening, and related educational programs. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries also holds many files concerning administrative matters. Although much of this is photocopied material, there are several useful original documents, especially from the 1980s, including budget and financial statements, a long range plan, and the results of a member survey.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The latter part of the subseries includes many files related to the archives project itself. These include drafts and notes related to the development of a historical timeline for the Hort, as well as general notes concerning the project and the development of the archives. These files also include preliminary partial finding aids and inventories of records created during the project.</field>
