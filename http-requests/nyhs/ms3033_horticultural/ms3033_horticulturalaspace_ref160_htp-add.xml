    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is composed of photographs of the activities, places, people and plants associated with the Horticultural Society of New York. The formats include glass plate lantern slides (4-1/2" x 3-1/2"), 35mm slides, transparencies, photographic prints (both black and white and color), and negatives.   The series is arranged into subseries by subject, including: Events, Programs, Facilities and Staff, Images Used in HSNY publications, and Other Images. The photographs in subseries A through D provide snapshots of the workings of the HSNY from the 1960s to 2000s. Photographs in subseries E focus on plants, and very few relate to identifiable Horticultural Society activities.</field>
