    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1811-circa 2010 (bulk, 1900-circa 2010)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of the Horticultural Society of New York (HSNY or Hort) extend from the organization's founding in 1900 through about 2010. They are preserved in various formats: manuscript and typed board meeting minutes, typescript financial statements, published periodicals, ephemera, posters, photographs, and a handful of artifacts (lapel pins, award plaques, etc.). They fall into nine categories partly imposed by the N-YHS archivists who processed the collection. Refer to the Arrangement Note following this one for an outline of how the records are divided and their respective date ranges. Fuller descriptions are provided in notes at each series and subseries level, but, briefly, the collection contains</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">General Administration Files: Includes the minutes of the HSNY Board of Directors for 1900–2007, its financial statements for 1959–1974, financial reports for the International Flower Show for 1930–1942, and the working files from the HSNY executive director's and president's offices. Also here is documentation on the acquisition and subsequent sale of the collection of botanical books and illustrations bequeathed to HSNY by Kenneth K. Mackenzie in 1934.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Library &amp; Archives Files: The Hort maintains an active research library today, and the material in the present collection documents its development and administration by way of accession registers, committee meeting minutes, and files on resources, funding, programming, and initiatives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Flower Show Records: Documentation of the flower shows sponsored by or organized by the HSNY between 1916 and 1998, the main ones being the International Flower Show, the Bryant Park Flower Show, and the New York Flower Show. Included are the myriad supporting periodicals for these events—programs, schedules of prizes, classes, and premiums—as well as photographs and a few scrapbooks spanning 1916–1998.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records from Other Horticultural Societies: From its earliest years the Hort worked closely with other plant and gardening associations. That likely explains how this material came to be part of the larger collection. Most of it pertains to the Brooklyn chapter of the National Plant, Flower, and Fruit Guild.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs: Images of the activities, places, people, and plants associated with the Hort in myriad formats: glass plate lantern slides, 35mm slides, transparencies, photographic prints (black-and-white and color), and negatives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Print Matter: Over its long existence the Hort has issued a broad range of publications in fulfillment of its mission to "diffuse information on all topics relating to the culture and care of plants." These include periodicals, yearbooks, bulletins, program calendars, and ephemera. The collection includes a small but interesting portion of early and mid-nineteenth century publications issued by other organizations that the HSNY kept for their focus on horticulture.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Audiovisual: HSNY recorded its meetings, lectures, programs and flower shows audiocassettes, 16- and 35mm film, Betamax and VHS tapes. Many of the latter save television appearances by Hort representatives on programs such as Good Day New York and the Today Show. Note that N-YHS lacks playback equipment, so this material is restricted.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Reference Files: These are ready-reference files kept by the HSNY for research purposes. They are split between personal names and topical subjects and include images, journal articles, news clippings, brochures, and biographical material.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Memorabilia: The collection includes a small number of artifacts, such as award ribbons and medals, lapel buttons and pins, and a few commemorative plaques bestowed on the HSNY for its horticultural contributions.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">New York City claims several horticultural "firsts." The first commercial nursery in America opened in what is now Flushing, Queens, in 1737. James Beekman built the country's first greenhouse on his Manhattan estate overlooking the East River in 1764. And in 1801 Dr. David Hosack opened his Elgin Botanic Garden—the first public botanical garden in the United States—on the site of Rockefeller Center. The first horticultural society in the nation, too, was formed in New York City in 1818. This early organization, the New York Horticultural Society, survived until the late nineteenth century. It should not be confused with the similarly-named Horticultural Society of New York, the subject of this finding aid and the source of the records described herein.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Horticultural Society of New York (a.k.a. "HSNY" or "the Hort") was established in 1900 "to collect and diffuse information on all topics relating to the culture and care of plants, fruits, flowers, and vegetables, and by all possible means to stimulate the knowledge and love of horticulture" through monthly meetings, formal lectures, and seasonal flower shows. Among its founders was botanist and taxonomist Nathaniel Lord Britton (1859–1934), first director of the New York Botanical Garden. Early members included banker J. P. Morgan, stained-glass designer Louis C. Tiffany, and others whose wealth afforded the leisurely pursuit of horticulture on estates tended by (largely) English-trained gardeners.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In its early years the HSNY held meetings and shows at the American Institute of the City of New York. In 1906 it launched a quarterly journal to disseminate scientific abstracts and book reviews.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beginning in 1910, the HSNY participated in and later sponsored the annual International Flower Show (IFS), a grand floral exhibition at Madison Square Garden, the Grand Central Palace, and ultimately, the New York Coliseum, that ran until 1970 (with the exception of two years during World War II).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Hort also held large spring flower shows at the New York Botanical Garden and the American Museum of Natural History, and regular seasonal exhibitions in its headquarters. Prizes awarded for professional and amateur flower arrangements at each event inspired friendly competition as members sought to improve their growing and showing skills while learning from the experience of others.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">For about a decade starting in the late 1960s the HSNY sponsored the Bryant Park Flower Show, the brainchild of longtime supporter Henrietta Sedgwick Lockwood. And in 1985 it began its signature New York Flower Show, which exhibited annually through 1996 (with the exception of 1994) on Hudson River piers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Society established its first office in 1920 in the Bankers Trust Building at 14 Wall Street, in quarters shared by the Garden Club of America. Membership swelled over the next thirty years, from 300 in 1920 to nearly 4,000 by 1950. To accommodate this increase the HSNY moved in 1948 to rooms in the Essex House at 160 Central Park South, where it stayed and exhibited until 1969. That year it relocated to 128 West 58th Street, a storefront space which provided additional room for staff, conferences, lectures, and shelving for the Hort's sizable library of botanical titles.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Along with regular lecture series and flower shows, the Hort's library has been one of its main attractions. Begun in 1924 as a working library for members (today it is open to the public, but only members have borrowing privileges), the collection grew rapidly, particularly through the generosity of collector Kenneth K. Mackenzie, whose 1934 bequest of 6,000 volumes included over 1,300 works by the great Swedish botanist and "father of modern taxonomy" Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778). Although these rare titles were eventually sold, the Hort's library today retains a respectable 12,000 volumes that draw gardeners, houseplant enthusiasts, artists, writers, designers, and students who use the collection to enhance their work.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over time the Hort has extended its mission to reflect the interests of the day, as is clear from some of their varied educational and beautification programs past and present, among them</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Apple Seed: An environmental and science education program for 3rd- to 6th-grade students. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Food for Life: Transformed abandoned lots into edible gardens.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Green Branches: A late 1990s program to plant gardens around public library branches. (A related Read &amp; Seed Program offered summer reading and gardening activities at the Green Branches libraries.) </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">GreenHouse (formerly GreenWorks): Horticultural therapy and vocational training for Rikers Island inmates.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">GreenTeam: Transitional employment opportunities for at-risk youth and ex-offenders.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Neighborhood Plaza Program: Beautifies low-income communities across New York City.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">NYDIGS: Affordable horticulture-based workshops, activities, and conferences.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Tree Corps and Community Gardening: Urban horticulture programs of the 1970s and 1980s. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 2006 the Horticultural Society of New York moved to its current location, 148 West 37th Street, from where it continues "to sustain the vital connection between people and plants" through "social service and public programs [designed to] educate and inspire . . . a broad community that values horticulture for the many benefits it brings to our environment, our neighborhoods, and our lives."</field>
