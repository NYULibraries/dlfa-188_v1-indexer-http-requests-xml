    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries primarily includes images that emphasize plants, either as individual specimens or in an aesthetic  context, such as with gardens, landscape architecture, interiors, topiaries, or floral displays. The subseries includes many images associated with international or domestic United States locations; while these images often emphasize plants they also include commercially-produced souvenir images of built structures and general tourist travel snapshots. While many of the images have some basic level of identification, most lack a more detailed context and few seem to relate to identifiable Horticultural Society activities (see subseries V.A. for those). Most of the images seem to date from the 1960s to early 1980s, but there are earlier and later views. The formats in the subseries include glass plate lantern slides (4-1/2" x 3-1/2"), 35mm slides, transparencies, photographic prints (mostly black and white), and negatives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although much of the subseries has a certain degree of randomness to it and ambiguity as to context, several portions are well-defined and substantive. These include a captioned photograph album of World War I scenes of troop movements and trench warfare with their related destruction of trees in France (1917); lantern slides of Mrs. Louis Levy's azalea and rock garden in Dobbs Ferry, NY; a photograph album documenting a trip to Japan (1967); sets of educational slides concerning sowing and repotting and turfgrass diseases; images by recognized photographers Ralph Bailey of House &amp; Garden and Bruce Cratsley; an organized set of slides depicting seasonal wildflowers; and two photograph albums of cacti cultivated by Richard Weiler.</field>
