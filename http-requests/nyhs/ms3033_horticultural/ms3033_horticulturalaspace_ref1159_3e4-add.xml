    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes periodical publications issued over time by the Hort that, generally, had its membership as the principal audience. The content and titles of these changed somewhat over time, but generally included information about organizational matters, such as upcoming events, and horticulture-related short articles and book reviews. Following is a general summary of the content of the titles in the subseries:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Memoirs: Three volumes that include the papers read at conferences organized by Hort in 1902, 1907, and 1926.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Journal: This ran from April 1906 to July 1924. It Includes annual reports, proceedings of Hort meetings, reports on the various flower exhibitions, library accessions, committee reports, and papers/lectures on horticultural matters. It was replaced by the Year Book. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Year Book: Started in May 1925, replacing the Journal. It includes annual reports, lectures/papers, flower show reports, accessions, etc. For the first few Year Books, the period covered is roughly August to May of the following year. In 1927, publication shifted to a calendar year basis. These appear to have ended in 1940, though a Year Book was published in 1951 to commemorate the events of 1950, the Hort's 50th anniversary year.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Monthly Bulletin / Bulletin: The Bulletin appears to have started about January 1930. It started as a small pamphlet with short announcements concerning upcoming meetings and events/programs, new members, and accessions. By the early 1930s, it expanded to include lists of awards given for exhibits at the monthly meetings. By 1933, it further expanded to include transcripts or summaries of lectures. By 1934, a glossy version appeared, with increasing numbers of photographs. In Feb 1942, the Bulletin started presenting annual reports for the prior year, fully replacing the Year Book. The Monthly Bulletin ended in 1947, going to quarterly in 1948. It ceased publication with the first quarter 1950. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">News: It started in January 1951, replacing the Bulletin. Slimmed down from the Bulletin and much more casual, the News no longer included annual reports or articles, but focused on announcements, award winners, accessions, and basic membership information, though over time the content got more expansive. It was produced irregularly and ended in early 1957.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Bulletin: Reintroducing the former title and replacing the News, the new Bulletin included both basic announcements and short articles, including book reviews. Starting in 1957, the Bulletin continued until 1973, though by 1970 it had been scaled down in size and scope. An announcement-oriented Member Newsletter started in late 1969, overlapping with the Bulletin through 1973. After 1973, the Member Newsletter (with the title shortened to just Newsletter in 1983) continued; the latest copy held by the subseries dates from 1998. The subseries holds a set of cards that represent an index to the Bulletin for the years 1958-1962.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Garden was a bi-monthly publication of The Garden Society, a division of the NY Botanical Garden. Subscriptions to Garden were a benefit of membership in one of the institutions comprising The Garden Society, of which Hort was one. The bulk of the magazine content was common to all institutions, but some front pages were content specific to Hort. The content was horticulture-related and was not concerned with Hort organizational and event matters.The subseries holds issues from 1977-1984 and 1986.</field>
