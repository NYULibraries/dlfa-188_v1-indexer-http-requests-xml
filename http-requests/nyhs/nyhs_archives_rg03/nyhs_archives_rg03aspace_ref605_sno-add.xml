    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Plans and Drawings subseries includes about 1200 plans related to the 1937-1938 expansion of the Central Park West building. Most of these plans are blueprints on paper or linen, though many are also bluelined whiteprints, photographic reproductions, penciled tracings, and other formats. Although most of the plans are by the architectural firm Walker &amp; Gillette, there is also a large number of plans by the general and sub-contractors of the project. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the plans, especially those of Walker &amp; Gillette, are represented with multiple versions. Many of these are duplicates, but many are the earlier and later versions of particular plans that were created over the course of the project. Some of the plans are annotated with crayon markings. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries also includes plans for the expansion proposed by York &amp; Sawyer in 1925 and in 1935-1936. None of those plans were accepted by N-YHS, which elected to use Walker &amp; Gillette for the job. Three drawings (watercolors?) of building designs proposed by Walker &amp; Gillette are in the subseries, including the one signed as approved by Director Alexander J. Wall.</field>
