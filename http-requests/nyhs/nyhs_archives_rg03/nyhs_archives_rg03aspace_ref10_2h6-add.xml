    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 2nd Avenue Building series includes documents concerning N-YHS's initiative in the mid-nineteenth century to construct a fireproof building to house and to present its collections. The series includes the minute books for three of the committees involved with the project: the committee to raise funds for the project, the trustees of the Building Fund, and the Building Committee charged by the trustees with responsibility for land acquisition and building design and construction. The series includes the printed specifications for the project, estimates received from contractors for the various aspects of the construction, contracts with some of the contractors, and summaries of the project revenue and expenses. There are several subscription books from both the original drive for funds in the late 1840s-early 1850s, and the drive for additional funds in 1856.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence includes several letters from the project's architects, Mettam &amp; Burke, as well as from the various craftsmen bidding for work or responding to changes in the project's original specifications. The correspondence also includes a few offers to N-YHS for real estate in 1850-1851, and documents concerning N-YHS's eventual sale of the building in the early twentieth century.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds about 25 architectural drawings, including floor plans, elevations, transverse views, longitudinal views, and others. Some of these are dated as from 1854 and are stamped or signed as the work product of architects (George B.) Carstesen &amp; (C.H.) Gildemeister; these are likely the proposals that were ultimately not accepted by N-YHS. The other drawings in the series are undated and unsigned.</field>
