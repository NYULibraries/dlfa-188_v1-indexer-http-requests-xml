    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Project Documents subseries includes files that appear, for the most part, to have been maintained by N-YHS Director Alexander J. Wall during the construction. The subseries includes minutes and general correspondence of the Building Committee overseeing the project, architect Walker &amp; Gillette's summaries of the regular construction status meetings they led, and correspondence with Walker &amp; Gillette, general contractor Turner Construction Company, and other architects and contractors bidding for work. Among the architects bidding for the work, but not winning, was York &amp; Sawyer, the architectural firm that had designed the central portion of the Central Park West building and that had offered designs for an expansion in the 1920s and in 1935; the subseries holds correspondence with that firm. The subseries holds a set of files concerning the various project sub-contractors and providers of materials; these include copies of the contracts between Turner and the sub-contractors and other documents. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries holds three sets of project specifications. There appears to be substantial overlap in the three sets, but also some differences among them in their level of completeness and the documents they include. One difference appears to be in how the specifications were originally filed, and perhaps whose files the specifications came from. One set, detailed in the container list, is alphabetical by the work to be done. A second set was numbered, though that is also roughly alphabetical. The third set is bound together.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries includes the monthly payment applications made by Turner Construction. These packets include detailed back-up including hours worked and materials used on the job, along with sub-contractor billings. There are also the detailed packing lists used in shipping the collection to offsite storage during the project. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The date range of the subseries begins in 1925-1926. This early date relates to documents concerning property acquisitions along West 76th and 77th streets, from Sarah Straus and John A. Weekes and Elsa A. Weekes, respectively.</field>
