    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series IV. Central Park West Construction: Expansion</field>
    <field name="unitdate_teim">1925-1946</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes documents concerning the expansion of the Central Park West building in 1937-1938. This expansion primarily involved the addition of wings to the north and south sides and a fifteen floor book stack to the rear of the existing building. The series includes well over 1200 blueprints and other formats of plans created by architects Walker &amp; GIllette, construction contractor Turner Construction Company, and various subcontractors for the project, though many of the plans are represented with multiple copies or revised versions. The series also includes construction specifications, progress reports, meeting summaries, correspondence among the principals, contracts, detailed supporting documentation from Turner Construction and their sub-contractors for work done and materials used, and payment records related to the support documentation. There are a small number of photographs of the construction site. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the 1937-1938 records, the series includes a small number of documents from the 1920s. These include York &amp; Sawyer's 1925 proposed expansion plans, related correspondence, documents related to the 1925 acquisition of property from Sarah Straus on West 76th Street, and a certified copy of a 1926 deed conveying property on West 77th Street from John A. and Elsa A. Weekes to N-YHS. There are also a small number of plans dating from the 1940s, shortly after the 1937-1938 expansion, including preliminary plans drawn by architect Philip N. Youtz in 1945-1946 for a further expansion of the building to encompass an Education Building.</field>
