    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes a wide range of materials documenting N-YHS's acquisition in 1891 of its current Central Park West site and the construction in the first decade of the twentieth century of the central portion of the building.  These documents include financial records, such as the various appeals over decades for funds, subscription books, Building Fund checkbooks and cancelled checks, and contractor invoices and other payments made from the Fund. These financial records also include the arrangements made with Henry Dexter in connection with his donations in support of the construction project. The 1891 purchase of the Central Park West property is documented primarily by the title abstracts, the related official title searches, and the deeds to the purchased lots as compiled and bound by N-YHS's attorney, Weekes Brothers. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is also much other material related to the design and construction of the building, in addition to that found in the financial records. These include minutes and correspondence of the N-YHS committees and officers leading the project, correspondence with architects York &amp; Sawyer and others, architectural and other drawings, contracts, and bids and estimates. The bulk of the drawings are by York &amp; Sawyer; others are by civil engineer Peter E. Nostrand and the Library Bureau (library and museum furniture). A small number of post-construction plans, from the 1910s, by the Library Bureau and by the firms of Nygren, Tenney &amp; Ohmes (heating &amp; ventilating) and Snead &amp; Co. (ironwork) are included in the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is material related to the cornerstone ceremony of November 1903, including artifacts such as pins and ribbons, a small album of photographs, York &amp; Sawyer's plan for the grandstand, and related correspondence. </field>
