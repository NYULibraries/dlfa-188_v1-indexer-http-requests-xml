    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series IV. French Playing Cards</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV. spans the years from 1668 to 1901 and contains 41 card decks and games. Cards are ordered by date and thereunder alphabetically by name or subject. Cards with known dates always come before those with circa dates.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The multiple packs of "French pre-Revolutionary cards" often had a secondary usage. For example, "French pre-Revolutionary cards #2a" has the lingerie accounts of a Mme. Marugal on the verso. Other cards have been used to clip other pieces of paper together or to help children learn the alphabet.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"Les Jeu des Fables" are three slotted books for metamorphosis-style game. Cards fit into each slot and can combine to make humorous combinations. "[Opaque Translucent cards]" show erotic scenes, but the hidden images are not as easy to discern as in the German and Spanish decks. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"[Multi-themed court cards]" is a very unusual deck. Each suit carries a different thematic motif. The hearts portray love, the spades military life, the clubs flowers, and the diamonds construction or labor. The ace of diamonds features nude men, figures usually scarce in card deck designs.</field>
