    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II contains twenty photographs taken in downtown New York from 1911 to 1922. Photographs are arranged alphabetically by title. There are many river scenes, often with a bridge in the background as in "East River, Barges, Ferryboat and the Williamsburg Bridge" (1913), "From Fulton Ferry Slip" (1916), "Under Brooklyn Bridge, From Under The Pier on the Brooklyn Side" (1916), and "Boat Basin at The Battery" (1913). "From Brooklyn Bridge" (1916) is taken from beneath the structure of the bridge; this interest in the dynamics of buildings is characteristic of many of Chapman's downtown photographs, and is also reflected in "Woolworth Building from Washington Market" (1915).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Another of Chapman's concentrations was building construction. Downtown New York was constantly changing as it is today, and Chapman showed this clearly in his photographs. There are two images titled "Construction Work, Wall and William Streets" (1922) which document busy construction sites. Chapman emphasized the shape of the cranes and heavy equipment used, and captured steam escaping from a vent in the background. "The Burling Slip Plant of the New York Steam Corporation Under Construction" (1916) is another photograph which reflects the changing face of downtown New York.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The El train is featured strongly in Chapman's work, perhaps because he rode it daily. "Greenwich Avenue From Sixth Avenue El Station" (1914), "From Chatham Square Station of Third Avenue El" (1915), and "Hanover Square, El Structure Now (1951) to be Demolished" all show the El train, usually taken from below and looking up at the structure of the track.</field>
