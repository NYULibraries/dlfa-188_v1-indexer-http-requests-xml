    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series contains papers of Harmon Hendricks relating to his importing business, trade in copper, and growing interest finding American sources of copper manufacture. It includes loose correspondence, inventories and other business records, letterbooks, ledgers and account books, indentures, and mortgages. It is arguably the most historically important of the collection and  one of the richest pertaining to a New York merchant in the carrying trade who subsequently helped to build one of America's basic industries. Notable are Harmon's correspondence with Paul Revere &amp; Son (Subseries II.C) and records regarding his ship, Ophelia.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Harmon Hendricks (1771-1838), Uriah's only surviving son, began working in his father's business as an apprentice, becoming a partner in 1792 at age twenty. Harmon was especially interested in the metals trade in which Uriah had recently become involved. After Uriah's death six years later, Harmon took over completely, discontinuing the West Indian trade to focus exclusively on the carrying trade with England and trade in America, particularly in copper and other metals.</field>
