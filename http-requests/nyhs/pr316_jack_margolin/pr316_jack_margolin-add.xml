    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jack Margolin was born in 1914 in Brooklyn to Russian-Jewish immigrants.  He trained as a linotype operator and worked for several newspapers (The New York Times, Daily News, New York Post) before opening his own small printing company in 1961, which specialized in math and science textbooks published by McGraw-Hill.  In 1962, Margolin married Pearl Klein.  They had three daughters and lived in Bayside, Queens.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Largely self-taught, Margolin began taking photographs in his 20's. After retiring in 1976, Margolin devoted himself to photography full-time. He was a member of several camera clubs (Fresh Meadows, Metropolitan, Queens) and participated in numerous juried shows. He died in New York in 1996.</field>
