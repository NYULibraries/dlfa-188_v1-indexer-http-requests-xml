    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Indians of North America contains early prints and early photographs, as well as copy photography and                    published illustrations. Photographs with the same provenance or which are historically notable have                      been isolated into their own folders. One of these is a series of photographs taken by the U.S. Signal                      Corps ca. 1890 in the Black Hills of Montana around the time of Custer's battle. A set of cabinet cards                     issued by the Santa Fe Route train company shows Native Americans of the Southwest, and were probably               meant as a tourist advertisement. One folder includes portrait photographs taken by William Henry                         Jackson for the Bureau of American Ethnology. Cyanotypes are also housed together.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Early European prints include a 1756 engraving of "Hendrick the Sachem, or Chief, of the Mohawks" and                  an 1827 hand-colored lithograph of "Les six Indiens de la tribu des Osages." A portrait of "Philip, King of                 Mount Hope," (Philip, Sachem of the Wampanoags, of King Philip's War) was engraved by Paul Revere,                    and is a plate from the 1772 edition of Benjamin Church's The Entertaining History of King Philip's War.                  Portraits of a "Maha Queen" and an "Ottoes Chief" are pages from an 1809 edition of the  Travels of                       Capts. Lewis and Clark. Additional early portraits are of "Joseph Thayendanekan, a Mohawk Chief," and                  of "Mico Chlucco the Long Warrior, Chief of the Seminoles." Any portrait in which a tribe was named has                 been filed with other images of Native Americans in that tribe. Portraits in which no tribe was mentioned               are filed alphabetically. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Prints after the work of early painters of Native Americans are plentiful. Most are hand-colored                               lithographs. A collection of plates of portraits of Indians after the artist George Catlin was given by Mrs.                 Ernest C. Kinney, a granddaughter-in-law of Catlin. These are most probably from a circa 1860 American                 edition of Catlin's Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North American                       Indians, and are housed together with a few other prints after Catlin. Scenes engraved after Carl Bodmer,               mainly for publication in mid to late 19th century magazines are found throughout this category.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Several lithographs are by John T. Bowen. Many of these images were published in Thomas McKenney and               James Hall's History of the Indian Tribes of North America 1836-1844. One folder contains hand-colored                  lithographs after James Otto Lewis's paintings of Native Americans. Some of these were lithographed by                 J. H. Bufford. Another folder contains hand-colored engravings after drawings by Jacques Grasset de                      Saint-Sauveur (1757-1810). Eight are from Grasset's  Encyclopedie des Voyages. . ., Paris: 1796. These                   drawings are all of Iroquois and were engraved by Jean Laroque (active 1730-1775). Other plates from                    another of Saint-Sauveur's books, all with French captions, are also included. These are possibly from a                   later edition of his  Costumes Civils Actuels de Tous les Peuples Connus, first published in 1788. </field>
