    <field name="scopecontent_teim">includes many printed copies of the U.S. Constitution, the Declaration of
Independence, and the Emancipation Proclamation, as well as several copies of southern states' secession
statements. There are several copies of a Declaration of Independence designed by John Binns, with
ornamental seals representing the states of the Union and Washington, Jefferson, and Hancock. A rare sheet
shows the Declaration of Independence surrounded by charts of statistical and historical information about
the United States, all within an ornamental arch and border. It was published by Humphrey Phelps and Bela
Squire in New York in October of 1832. A lithographed "Facsimile of the Emancipation Proclamation" was
issued in Chicago in 1863, to be sold for $2 each; the resulting money was to be used for the erection of a
permanent home for the sick and disabled soldiers of the Union Army. Lithographed copies of secession
ordinances, printed in the 1860s, are from Virginia, Louisiana (printed in English and French) and South
Carolina. Notable among other documents included here are a "Declaration of Sentiments, adopted by the
Peace Convention, held in Boston, September 18, 19, and 20, 1838;" a hand-colored "Pictorial History of the
United States" from 1846, and an illuminated parchment broadside with hand-calligraphy, a gift from the
Netherlands Hudson-Fulton Celebration Committee to the New York Hudson-Fulton Celebration
Committee, at the time of the 1909 Hudson-Fulton celebration.</field>
