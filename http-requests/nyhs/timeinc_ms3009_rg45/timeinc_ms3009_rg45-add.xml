    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Daniel Okrent Files include his correspondence and subject files created during his tenure as Editor of New Media and document this department's management of Time Inc.'s internet projects including websites for each magazine. The paperwork transferring Okrent's files to the archives is in his Bio file. Some files from his time as Managing Editor of Life were included in the transfer and remain with these files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to records about Time Inc. Multimedia/Time Inc. New Media in the Time Inc. Subject Files (MS 3009-RG 1), Time Inc. created the New Media department in November 1993 in preparation for the testing of an interactive cable TV service with the appointment of Walter Isaacson as editor. At this time, the department Time Inc. Multimedia already existed separately. In 1994, Time magazine announced it was planning "a World Wide Web 'site'" and began testing of Pathfinder in October 1994 with supervision from both Time Inc. Multimedia and New Media. Pathfinder was an early Time Warner website containing editorial material from all Time Warner divisions including Time Inc. magazines. By mid-1997, news articles indicate that Pathfinder was struggling, and Time Inc. abandoned it at some point in favor of maintaining individual websites for each magazine. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">When head of Multimedia Curt Viebranz left Time Inc., Isaacson and New Media took over management of Time Inc.'s online, cable online and electronic distribution of content. In January 1995, Paul Sagan was appointed Senior Vice President of New Media, later becoming President and Editor of New Media. In June 1996 New Media appointed Meg Siesfeld as the Managing Editor, responsible for the continuing development of Pathfinder. Sagan resigned at the end of 1996 with Danial Okrent replacing him as Editor of New Media. In February 1997, Time Inc. appointed Craig Forman as the Editor-at-Large for New Media. In April 1997, Linda McCutcheon Conneally was appointed as President of New Media, filling the position left by Sagan. It isn't documented how long after her resignation from Time Inc. in April 1999 the New Media department remained in existence.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Other projects managed by New Media included participation in the launch of Road Runner high speed cable internet in September 1996, a service created by the Excalibur Group, a joint venture of Time Warner Cable and Time Inc.; Thrive, a joint venture between Time Inc. and America Online providing content about healthy living; and Money.com Plus, a subscription personal finance website with partner Thomson Financial Services.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Daniel Okrent joined Life in 1989 as a consultant and contributing editor before being appointed as the Assistant Managing Editor. In December 1992, he was appointed the Life Managing Editor. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Daniel Okrent joined the New Media department as Editor at the end of 1996, taking over one of the roles vacated by Paul Sagan. According to a November 1996 news release announcing Okrent's appointment, he "will oversee the editorial content of the company's online, cable online and Internet publishing activities. In addition to his responsibilities for Pathfinder... Okrent will work closely with the managing editors of the Time Inc. magazines to fully exploit the online opportunities for each of the company's titles." and "work with ...outside content providers interested in pursuing new media initiatives with Time Inc." Okrent served two years in this position before being named Time Inc. Editor-at-Large in March 1999.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Aside from his work at Time Inc., Okrent was a writer and participated as a commentator in Ken Burns's documentary on baseball.</field>
