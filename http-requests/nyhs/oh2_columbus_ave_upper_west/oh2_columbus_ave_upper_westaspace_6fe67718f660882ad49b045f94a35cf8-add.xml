    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this two-part interview, Robert Quinlan (b. December 15, 1932) recalls the experiences that helped educate and shape him, from growing up in the industrial town of New Britain, Connecticut to serving nearly two years in Verona, Italy with the United States Army. He talks about moving to New York City in 1959 to attend graduate school at Columbia University, and then starting work as a real estate consultant, first at Brown Harris Stevens and then at Landauer Associates. Quinlan recalls moving to The Dakota in 1969 and recognizing the redevelopment potential on Columbus Avenue. He describes some of the properties that he bought and renovated on Columbus Avenue in the 1970s, including The Endicott. Quinlan tells the story of founding and naming his property management company, Walker, Malloy &amp; Company. Quinlan shares some of his thinking about retail and reminisces about some of his early tenants on Columbus Avenue, such as DDL Foodshow (lobby of the Endicott Hotel), The Silver Palate (274 Columbus Avenue), and Endicott Booksellers (450 Columbus Ave). In discussing his approach to retail, he also talks about his tenant, Liana (324 Columbus Avenue), a women's clothing store that opened in 1982 and is still in business (the owners, Eunsook and Liana Pai, were interviewed as part of this oral history project). Quinlan tells the story of developing plans in the early 1980s to build above the New-York Historical Society and the neighborhood opposition that defeated the project. Quinlan describes the founding of the Columbus Avenue Business Improvement District and reflects on his effect on Columbus Avenue.</field>
