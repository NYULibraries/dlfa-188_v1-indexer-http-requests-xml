    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this two-part interview, George Beane (b. January 14, 1944) describes New York as he has known it, from his first days in the city chauffeuring people to the 1964 World's Fair to the Upper West Side in 2019. He recalls moving to The Dakota in 1972, where he met neighbor Robert Quinlan (also interviewed for this oral history project), who was becoming a real estate developer on the Upper West Side. In 1976, Beane and Quinlan formed Walker, Malloy &amp; Company to manage Quinlan's growing portfolio of buildings. In 1978, Beane formed A. R. Walker &amp; Company to manage the buildings he was buying. Beane talks about the changes he saw in the neighborhood in the 1970s and '80s, from individual families and small real estate developers like the Brusco family buying and renovating brownstones, to the new shops and restaurants that were opening on Columbus Avenue. He also describes his experience as a hands-on building manager and landlord.</field>
