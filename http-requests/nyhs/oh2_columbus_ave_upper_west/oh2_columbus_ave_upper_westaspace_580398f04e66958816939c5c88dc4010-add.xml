    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this two-part interview, Bill Bailey (b. March 19, 1939) and Laurie Eichengreen (b. July 7, 1943) discuss their early lives and tell the story of Mythology, an eclectic store formerly located at 370 Columbus Avenue. They describe how the space evolved from Bailey's art studio in 1970 to a store where they sold a variety of books, art, toys, masks, and myriad unusual things. Bailey discusses being inspired by professor of literature Joseph Campbell, and how he came to name the store for Campbell's theories of mythology. Bailey and Eichengreen recall some of the businesses that opened on Columbus Avenue and reminisce about the friendships they formed with local business owners. Bailey talks about his silk-screening innovations and describes a few of the approximately 500 t-shirts he designed and printed for businesses that were coming to Columbus Avenue in the 1970s and '80s, like The Cultured Seed and Bicycle Renaissance. They describe how they expanded and designed the store's interior and recall some of their innovations such as creative window displays that they changed every night. Bailey and Eichengreen reflect on their role in the neighborhood and on the continuing evolution of the Upper West Side. </field>
