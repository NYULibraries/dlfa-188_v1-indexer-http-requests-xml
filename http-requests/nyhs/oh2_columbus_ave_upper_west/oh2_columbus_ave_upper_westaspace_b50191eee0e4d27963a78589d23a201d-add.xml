    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Cassandra Medley (b. August 9, 1949) talks about growing up in a predominantly Black, working-class neighborhood in segregated Detroit when the economy was thriving, and good jobs were abundant. She recalls her early interest in theater and the emergence of the civil rights movement. Medley discusses moving to New York City in 1971, just after graduating from the University of Michigan, to pursue a career in theater. In 1973, Medley moved into the apartment where she still lives, on Columbus Avenue at West 73rd Street. She describes the "funky" Upper West Side neighborhood that she found then, a mix of predominantly Black and Puerto Rican families, white families in renovated brownstones, and young single people attracted to the area by the low rent. She describes her enjoyment of living somewhere racially diverse and describes the area as both "personable" and "dangerous." She describes changes to the neighborhood in the 1980s, as boutiques and caf√©s filled the retail spaces and more white families moved to the area, making the neighborhood more expensive and less economically and racially diverse. Medley discusses her career, starting as a receptionist and becoming a literary manager at the American Place Theater, and moving on to the Ensemble Studio Theatre where she became a playwright. Having retired as a faculty member in the Theatre Program at Sarah Lawrence College, Medley talks about her future plans and reflects on New York City's pivotal role in her career and life.</field>
