    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this two-part interview, Eunsook Pai (b. September 9, 1942) and her daughter Liana Pai (b. December 26, 1966) talk about their women's clothing store, named Liana, located at 324 Columbus Avenue. They tell the story of how Eunsook and her sister, Hyun-sook Lee, came to open the store in 1982 on Columbus Avenue, where the rent was affordable. Eunsook describes setting up the store, opening day, and how she and her sister worked to establish the business. Having worked at the store since she was 15 years old, Liana recalls the small businesses and community of owners on Columbus Avenue in the store's early years. Liana and Eunsook both talk about the challenges of running a small business, the special connection they have with their customers, and the way the business is changing. They talk about having fewer relationships in recent years with fellow store owners due to the increasing number of retail chain stores and empty storefronts on Columbus Avenue. Liana and Eunsook describe the role of Korean culture in how they relate to one another both personally and professionally. They reflect on the significance of winning a WESTY (West Side Spirit Thanks you) Award in 2019 and what the community means to them. </field>
