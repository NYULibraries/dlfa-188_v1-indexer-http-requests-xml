    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series holds 46 newspaper comic strip proof sheets issued by King Features in late 1935 to early 1936. These were most likely to have been among those included in the exhibition at Ferargil Gallery in 1936 from which a selection of comics was made for N-YHS (see Historical Note). 31 of the sheets are for the Sunday comics, and so are larger in size for full page publication with more panels than the sheets for the daily papers, of which there are 15 horizontal sheets. The daily sheets each include only one day's strip, not multiple days. All are black and white line art, without color. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list includes all sheets/titles in the series. The cartoonist name is noted following the title in parentheses. Two entries have multiple titles separated with a slash (/); these indicate a mix of strips on the sheet (e.g., a mix of a horizontal strip and a single panel comic). Many of the strips are not titled within the strip itself, but a title and cartoonist name were noted on the reverse either by King Features or at N-YHS. The series holds a mix of humorous strips and adventure/action strips.</field>
