    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes eighteen color photographs of Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York, by Elizabeth Keegin Colley. The photographs include images of the Long Meadow, Ambergill Falls, the Lake, Vale of Cashmere, Meadowport Arch, Lullwater Bridge, and Boathouse, as well as some of the park's flora and fauna.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs are pigment inkjet on archival paper, printed from digital images. The images are printed on sixteen sheets (two sheets include two images each), measuring about 25" x 17". Some of these photographs can be viewed on Colley's website. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Photographer Elizabeth Keegin Colley and her husband, David P. Colley, often worked together as a photographer/writer team. In the early 2000s, they responded to a request for proposals from the Prospect Park Alliance for a history of the park. With the winning proposal, the Colleys set to work on what would be published as Prospect Park: Olmsted &amp; Vaux's Brooklyn Masterpiece (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2013). The images in this collection were included, along with many others, in the book. </field>
