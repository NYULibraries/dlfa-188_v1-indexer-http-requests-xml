    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II. Legal Papers, Ephemera and Other Materials: Includes legal documents relating to deeds, mortgages, and trusts; newspaper clippings; calling cards from friends and neighbors; academic report cards; programs from different entertainment activities; account ledgers for groceries, seafood, and butchers meat; as well as diaries, of which the bound diary includes recipes towards the end.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III. Photographs: Includes a selection of photographs, stereographs, cabinet cards, and a few negatives.  The photographs are both posed and candid images of the extended Guion family, as well as a large selection of photographs of animals, which George Guion used as reference for painting.  There are two photograph albums: One is of an unmarked wedding from the 1920's, and the second includes prints of animals sent to George.  While most of the photographs are completely unmarked, some are labeled with the individuals who are in the image or the date, and a few have notes on the back.</field>
