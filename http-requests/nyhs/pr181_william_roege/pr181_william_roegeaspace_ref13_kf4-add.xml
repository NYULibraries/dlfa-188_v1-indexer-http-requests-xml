    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I spans the period from 1910 to ca. 1931 and includes some undated images. The approximately 175 photographic prints in this series are modern 11 x 14 inch silver gelatin contact prints produced by Klein Brothers Studios, New York, between 1968 and 1970 from Roege's vintage negatives. They were made as part of the New-York Historical Society's effort to reformat their brittle oversize negatives; most of the negatives from which these prints were made have been destroyed.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The photographs in this series are arranged into the following subseries, alphabetically by subject: Bridge and River Views; Churches; Commercial and Public Buildings; Hotels; Restaurants; Street Scenes; Theaters; and Miscellaneous. Within each series, photographs are arranged alphabetically. Corresponding negative numbers have been written in parentheses after each subject to aid researchers and indicate the number of views available. Many of Roege's views are populated by active people and early automobiles, and provide an energetic glimpse of city life from the 1910s through 1930s.</field>
