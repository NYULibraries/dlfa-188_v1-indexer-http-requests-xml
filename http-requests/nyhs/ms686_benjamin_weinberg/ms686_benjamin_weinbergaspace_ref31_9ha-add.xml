    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are more than 240 photographs in this collection, along with 145 snapshot negatives. Most are not dated nor are the subjects identified. They are arranged by format and by any existing labels.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Box 2, Folder 1 contains eighteen portraits, from passport size to postcard size, mostly of Benjamin Weinberg. His wife's identification photograph is included as are several unidentified subjects. Folder 2 consists of six photographs of Weinberg on board a ship during his 1936 trip to Poland; Folder 3, three photographs identified as "1938 Trip to Europe." Of the many snapshots included, twenty were identified as relating to the 1936 trip, fifty-seven to the 1936 trip and family members. Throughout the 108 unlabeled snapshots, however, there are similar photos, indicating that the labels may be misleading.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of the five formal group photographs contained in Box 2, Folder 8, three are identified in Hebrew, one in English. The one without date or identification appears to involve, among others, Benjamin Weinberg and Fiorello LaGuardia. One oversized group photograph is contained in Box 3.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is one folder containing thirteen postcards (Box 2, Folder 9). Many are photographs of the Polish city of Krzemieniec (Weinberg was one of the directors of an organization called "N.Y. Relief Organization for the City of Krzemieniec Poland.") One postcard appears to be Weinberg's silhouette. </field>
