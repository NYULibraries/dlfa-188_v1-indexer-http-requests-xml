    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For ease of access, business and family records of the Rentschler family from Hamilton, Ohio, were combined with Gordon S. Rentschler death paper and genealogical materials that originated in New York. However, the death papers are listed separately within Series III.

The materials include minutes, business records, personal correspondence, certificates, diplomas, news clippings, memorabilia, photographic prints, and maps. They are a disparate body of documents, lacking in in-depth information. There is a dearth of material produced by Rentschler himself. However, when viewed in their entirety they provide a picture of a man from a successful mid-western family who entered the world of high finance and rose to the top of his profession as a result of unyielding hard work.

The business documents include minutes of the George A. Rentschler Company from 1925–1944 (Box Man-14, Folder 13–15), as well as a letter written in 1885 concerning the company's castor patent (Box Man-14, Folder 20). The growth and scope of the Rentschler foundry is visible in a draft of the Hooven Owens Rentschler Company publication on heavy-duty engines (1919; Box Man-14, Folder 17). Product specifications, pricelists, and advertising provide useful information on production and marketing within the industry from 1923–1938 (Box 14, Folder 18). Excellent background information on the history of Butler County and Hamilton, Ohio, including the Great Flood of 1913 is found in the genealogical/historical group of documents at the end of Subseries I.C (Box Man-21, Folder 13).

Material from the childhood and young adulthood of the Rentschler siblings consists of letters (from George to his mother), valentines (from George to his mother and Robert to his sister and brother George), essays, school reports, and yearbooks. Gordon's Hamilton High School reports and Princeton University reports (1898–1907) are found in Box Man-15, Folder 4. A train trip by Thomas A. Dorsey, Howard See, Frederick B. Rentschler, Robert P. Rentschler, and Gordon S. Rentschler to the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair provides an interesting travelogue (Box Man-15, Folder 11). The death of Robert P. Rentschler in 1915 at the age of thirty-one is recorded in a condolence letter from Louis D. Froelick, the Princeton Class Secretary, to Phoebe S. Rentschler, and in a bound resolution from his class (Box Man-15, Folder 17). The collection also contains letters from three female friends of Gordon Rentschler's: Dorothy McKinney, Antoinette C. Hearne, and Helen Marie Brant, written from 1910 to 1912 (Box Man-15, Folder 7). Brant's letters in particular contain a vivid description of a road trip across the Southwest of the United States.

Later correspondence (circa 1918–1948) is an eclectic mix of letters recording the milestones in Rentschler's life and his personal and public service. These include: Sidney Waldon's praise for Rentschler's unsung war efforts in 1918 (Box 15, Folder 18); thankyou letters for gifts and employment assistance (Box 15, Folders 20 &amp; 22); a tribute from his Princeton University Class of 1907, honoring his appointment as National City Bank President (Box 16, Folder 2); correspondence from James M. Cox, Governor of Ohio and 1920 presidential running mate to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, awarding him a "Rentschler Badge" for his role in breaking up a gang of horse thieves in Butler County, Ohio (1931; Box 16, Folder 7). An annotated note attached to another medal reads "struck in memory of the wash-room episode Aug 26 1933 on L.I. when some 'hero' socked the 'Kingfish'—Huey Long—in much needed retribution." Huey Long was a controversial Senator from Louisiana. The badge and the event that the note refer to are unknown. However, this was the period of banking Senate Committee Hearings in Washington, D.C. (Medal removed to Box Mem-38).

In 1947 he was presented with the Belgian Order of the Crown, and in 1949 he was appointed Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), both awards honored his work during World War II, the latter was awarded for his efforts in the Lend Lease program. (The correspondence suggests that he was awarded the CBE in 1947, but the medal was received posthumously by Mary C. Rentschler in 1949. The correspondence can be found in Box 16, Folders 18 &amp; 20. The medals were removed to Boxes Mem-40 and Mem-41.) Similarly, he received certificates signed by New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia (1941) and United States President Harry Truman (1946). (Removed to oversize print material Box 3). All of these letters, certificates, and medals reflect a life of public service as the leader of one of America's largest banking institutions. This is firmly underscored by the large number of condolence letters received by his wife and National City Bank at the time of his death in 1948. Correspondents include: Ralph S. Danon, Abraham Flexner, B. C. Forbes, James Forrestal, Bernard F. Gimbel, John D. Rockefeller, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., Robert M. Sohngen, and Cardinal Spellman. Gordon Rentschler's death papers also include beautiful, illuminated testimonials from companies and institutions associated with him, as well as correspondence surrounding the creation of a Gordon S. Rentschler memorial professorship at Princeton University. (The death papers are in Boxes Man-18 &amp; Man-19.)

The documents demonstrate Rentschler's stature in the business world. However, this knowledge is balanced with a few other, more private artifacts in the collection. Rentschler's bible contains selected correspondence, such as the following letter from Mary C. Rentschler at the time of her first husband's death:

"If it were not for friends like you, I do not know how I could go on. But I draw strength from the love I know you bore Ted—&amp; that I feel you will always bear him—for that is the kind of friend you are, as he often told me. Ted's friendship with you was one of his most cherished possessions. I hope I may be allowed to keep it and guard it always. Most devotedly yours, Mary C. Atkins" (1923 January 30; The bible and letters are housed together in Box Mem-30).</field>
