    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mary Shepley Coolidge Atkins Rentschler amassed an extraordinary wealth of family materials during her lifetime. Subseries I.B materials include copies of wills, correspondence, diaries, publications, drawings, memorabilia, blueprints, photographic albums, and photographic prints and negatives. The bulk of the written material falls into five main categories: early correspondence and documents, including love letters from Charles A. Coolidge to Julia S. Coolidge (1874–1900); diaries and correspondence from Mary's youth and marriage to Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. (1904–1923); general correspondence and love letters between Mary C. Rentschler and Gordon S. Rentschler (1923–1927); general correspondence to and from Mary C. Rentschler (1927–1974); genealogical material.

Correspondence, 1874–1900

In October 1889 Charles A. Coolidge married the sister of George Foster Shepley, one of the original partners of the architectural firm of Shepley Rutan and Coolidge. The love letters from Charles A. Coolidge to Julia Shepley written from February to April 1889 provide insight into a passionate and creative man and a leader in the field of architectural design.

His passion for art and architecture runs through the correspondence. He read Burkhardt and books about the Italian Renaissance over American literature (1889 March 20; Box Man-4, Folder 1), and describes sketching a Turner painting hanging opposite his bed (1889 March 15; Box Man-3, Folder 22). his firm was busy with many architectural commissions, including the Ames building (the first skyscraper in Boston), and Boston's Trinity Church: "I am going to take up the porch and front of Trinity Church and see if I cannot put it through as I do not know of anything that would be more of an improvement to the City" (1889 April 5; Box Man-4, Folder 1); and Stanford University in California "I spent all day with the Governor and Mrs. Stanford and I think we have finally settled the dormitory. Mrs. S. wanted to talk about you &amp; the engagement &amp; kept interrupting the business talk; you would have been amused and angry at the same time. . ." (1889 April 7; Box Man-4, Folder 1).

In another letter he writes "Mr. Olmsted telegraphed me today that the Governor will be here" (1889 April 3; Box Man-4, Folder 1). This was, perhaps, Frederick Law Olmsted. The letters suggest a lack of bureaucracy surrounding the construction of so many important buildings, and reflect Coolidge's pivotal involvement in creating the urban landscape of his day.

His letters are filled with yearning for Julia and a desire for a meaningful relationship (1889 February 27; Box Man-3, Folder 22; and 1889 March 19; Box Man-4, Folder 1). The letters convey an enormous respect, however their passion is not colored by sentimentality. On the contrary, it is the straightforward, almost "modern" quality of the correspondence that is most striking. Although we do not have Julia's letters, the responses in his letters suggest that she is less certain of marriage than he is. In a reply as to whether or not he would take care of her in her old age he says of course, and "as for your having always hated the idea of passing long, long years with one person, I should think that was an argument why you should now make up your mind to leave your mother" (1889 April 3; Box Man-4, Folder 1). He morbidly jokes that with all the traveling he makes to visit her she will soon have her freedom as a young widow, implying that he will die of exhaustion. In another letter he writes "cheer up dear you are not [to] be married yet never if you do not want to be and you need not be married for 'all your life' as you can kill me off very easily afterwards if you want to. Saturday Eve" (1889 circa April 5; Box Man-4, Folder 1).

This candid attitude reverberates throughout his letters. He is forthright in his dismissal of frivolous socializing and heaps scorn on the temperance movement:

"I have been holding forth on the false name and position of these temperance people, in the first place no sensible person can help acknowledging that temperance means a moderate &amp; uninjurious use of whatever food or liquid that you may be discussing &amp; when a total abolitionist objects to be called that &amp; says he is simply promoting temperance I feel like telling him he is a liar" (1889 April 8; Box Man-4, Folder 1).

Correspondence, 1904–1923

The second group of documents amongst the Mary C. Rentschler material is the diaries and correspondence of her youth and first marriage to Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. (1904–1923). Mary C. Rentschler's diaries span from 1904–1917 (from twelve to twenty-five years of age). Covering her childhood in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to her life in Cuba as a young bride, they provide a glimpse of Boston's youthful high society in 1915 and the life of a young bride and expatriate in Cuba two years later. In 1917 her husband joined the signal corps preparing for action in World War I France. The letters from the soldier to his parents as well as from Mary to her mother-in-law provide descriptions of army life. Finally, the death of Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. and the two sons is recorded in condolence letters to Charles A. Coolidge, Sr. in 1923.

Mary Rentschler's 1915 diary indicates a life focused on theatre engagements and her fiancé, Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. (Box Man-4, Folder 4). What appears is a headstrong young woman who by 1917 is married and pregnant and is thoroughly enjoying the adventure of life in Cuba. The diaries and letters concerning Cuba provide wonderful primary source material of life as the wife of a North American sugar planter. They document the political and social upheaval of the times, as well as the domestic life of a plantation. Mary C. Rentschler describes the arson, robberies, shootings, and kidnapping of a colleague (Mr. Van Petten) that the Atkins plantations endured during various insurrections. New of visits by senior United States officials to Soledad underscore Edwin F. Atkins Sr.'s prominent position. In an entry in her diary Mar C. Rentschler notes: "Heigh-ho, it's a funny family in a funny country. But we are all so pleased that the troops are sent &amp; that it was Pa [Edwin F. Atkins, Sr.] who sent them!" (1917 March 9; Box Man-4, Folder 7). (The troops are United States forces sent to protect North American property.) The anxiety of the events is overcome by a great sense of adventure: "Grand excitement! Yesterday Pa received a letter from Bob [probably Robert Atkins] saying they had received order from rebs. to stop grinding &amp; notification that the cane would be burned &amp; mill blown up. Pa &amp; Ma planned to leave this a.m. for P.A. [Punta Alegre]" (1917 March 6). Soledad is full of conversation about Cuban politics and the blundering and corrupt presidencies of Jose Miguel Gomez and General Mario Menocal (the former was president 1909–1913, the latter, 1913–1921).

Amid the chaos in 1917 she writes about the surge in sugar production: "We had a record run last week. Not one engine was stopped from the time it started till we stopped at 7 p.m. last night. It's never been done here before. The week before we stopped only once for 15 minutes. Isn't that pretty good?" (1917 February 26; Box Man-4, Folder 5). The texts corroborate this period as one of thriving industry despite the political upheavals. Her descriptions of sounds, people, and life in Soledad are beautifully evocative; she pens her letters to the noise of the sugar mill and a bustling household, which included her mother-in-law, Ma (Katherine W. Atkins), her father-in-law, Pa (E.F.A., Sr.), her sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Helen and Bill (Claflin), Mr. Hughes (plantation manager), and her sister, Julia (Coolidge Deane). When Rentschler is not writing of attacks on the batey (the village around the sugar mill) she describes the sewing classes that she and her mother-in-law give, as well as the movies and parties and horse riding expeditions. However, by 1921, the tone has altered. In a letter to Edwin F. Atkins, Sr., Mary write: "The atmosphere seems to be rather that of 'the morning after,' everyone awake again to the cold reality of life after the rosy colors of the last two years." (Saturday, 1921?; Box Man-4, Folder 13). The price of sugar has plummeted and will never fully recover.

Correspondence, 1923–1927

The love letters of Mary C. Rentschler and Gordon S. Rentschler are passionate and powerful. The letters offer an empathetic portrait of Gordon Rentschler providing a tender and intimate portrayal of a man at the heart of American big business. Mary gratefully acknowledges a letter from Gordon on the first anniversary of the death of her original family, January 1924: "You know, Gordon, you are the only one, except his mother, who ever speaks to me of Ted. To have him dropped out so completely is almost the hardest part of all" (1924 January 2; Box Man-4, Folder 17). His sensitivity to her personal loss and the acknowledgement of her past are very much appreciated by her. He appears to recognize the symbiotic relationship between mother and daughter and sensitively appeals to the adoration Mary has for her child: "Faith is even better than we always think she is. I wish Ted could see her, as he would be delighted with her. I can almost see his eyes dance and hear his great laugh as he would play with her" (1925 November 1; Box Man-5, Folder 4).

Their letters are full of the details of daily life. Mary describes life on the plantation in Cuba and on holiday in Marion, Massachusetts, and Gordon describes the world of high finance that he moves in. On a whirlwind business tour of Europe in the summer of 1925, Gordon describes staying at the Hotel Ritz in Barcelona: "tell Faith that my room has a big Russian Bath which one gets into by walking down three steps and when it is all full of water a girl as big as xx could take a good swim in it. It is my first experience with such a luxury so I played in it like any other farmer boy would" (undated; Box Man-5, Folder 3). His letters provide a tantalizing glimpse at the world of high finance and high society in the 1920s. At a dinner at the Ritz Hotel in New York Gordon writes: "Alex Moore of Spanish Ambassador fame and Charlie Chaplin ate next door to us and bickered back and forth between courses, and nearby sat Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte—nice but the water is too deeply mixed with the wine of one-time greatness" (1927 June 8; Box Man-8, Folder 4). Indeed, his correspondence indicates a firsthand knowledge of international politics:

"Charlie Mitchell [NCB Chairman] and I had a pleasant time bickering and dining and then gossiping with Averell Harriman about his dealings with the Russian Bolsheviks in his new xx in Georgia. He seems to have his things all set well, but I question how well any of us can get on with the Bolsheviks in their present frame of mind" (1925 June 19; Box Man-5, Folder 2).

By March 1927, four months before their marriage, Mary's letters have become familiar, tender, and humorous. Gordon writes to Mary of a dinner he attended with Kerensky and Mary replies: 

"There are moments when I do wish I were a man, to be in on such like meetings. There are so few people who will give a woman credit for owning any brains &amp; using them, or being interested in anything but clothes, houses, or babies! That's one of the nice things about you, you do. One of the best compliments I ever had paid me, was when one of Ted's friends heaved a sigh &amp; said 'Isn't it great to be out with just a bunch of fellows!' (Me being the only lady present.) On the other hand there are moments when I would not be a man for anything—unless you were a lady—which really stretches the imagination further than it will go" (1927 March 29; Box Man-6, Folder 6).

Her love for "my Man," as she address him, is wholeheartedly reciprocated; Gordon writes to her in Cuba from his home at 933 Fifth Avenue, New York:

"Tonight again I've watched the moon come over the park. It's a great moon here but of course not like it is sifting through xx palm trees because some where beyond the palms is my Mary, lovely happy and gay . . . as I watch this moon night after night I see my own little Mary. And some times she seems so very close. But always she is the same wonderful girl, lovely, sensible human" (1927 March 19; Box Man-6, Folder 8).

The reader is left with an image of a man utterly in love, who displays an almost childlike pleasure at his good fortune and who is enormously grateful for the opportunities that have been presented to him. Mary, raised in a sophisticated New England home, displays a level-headedness and personal fortitude that enable her to create a new life with the man from Ohio. "On the whole I'm glad my future doesn't seem to be about to include the spending of the rest of my life with a dyed-in-the-wool &amp; never-exported Bostonian" (Wed. eve., 1927; Box Man-6, Folder 6).

Correspondence, 1927–1974

The majority of this correspondence is to Mary C. Rentschler, from Katherine W. Atkinks, Julia C. Deane, and Isabel Coolidge. Other significant letters were written by Llewelyn (Daddy) Hughes, Julia S. Coolidge, and Faith A. Witter. The bulk of the material was written from 1929 to 1941. The letters bear witness to the flamboyance of the 1920s and the subsequent Depression. We read about Gordon's appearance in Senate hearings in Washington, D.C., Cuba's self-imposed cane production quotas, and the approach of war. The letters, particularly those of Daddy Hughes and Katherine W. Atkins in Cuba, provide wonderful firsthand knowledge of a country suffering from poverty and the legacy of colonial domination. But above all we learn about the daily lives of Mary and her family.

Faith A. Witter, Mary's third child, is a seminal character within Mary's correspondence and life. The collection contains a diary of Faith's progress from the age of nine months to four years of age, written by the child's nanny, Mary Goode McLaughlin, as well as many of her daughter's letters (Box Man-4, Folder 16). [The file containing McLaughlin's notes is contained in the 1923–1927 group of materials.] Mary frequently wrote about her children's progress, and in particular about her feelings for Faith:

"I am glad you find her sweet, for, to me, of course, she is unique. She is so much a part of me that I really cannot express myself intelligently—We frequently read each others' thoughts &amp; when she is by me there is a contentment that nothing else brings. I couldn't bear for you not to like her rather especially" (Long Island, 1929; Box Man-9, Folder 11).

In another letter written that summer to her mother-in-law, Katherine Atkins, Mary writes again of Faith. In this letter a powerful image is drawn of a life of ease for America's affluent society:

 "Charlie Mitchell &amp; Sloan Colt arrived off Charlie's vessel, chartered for the summer, &amp; ate us out of house &amp; home. . . I am going into town tomorrow—like Adelina Pati, for the 'last time.' Each time I swear I'll not go again &amp; then I get so bored &amp; so many things need doing, that I have to go—This time a wedding present for young Margaret Sims, and, very important but what I'd entirely forgotten, some furniture for the new infants' nursery. . . There goes Webb, exercising Mr. Cravath's horse. I expect he'll be glad to have his Miss Chatterbox back. He found it much more amusing dragging Popcorn &amp; the conversational Faith on a leading rein, than going alone—We are suffering from a most objectionable son of a most objectionable father. The son is learning to fly &amp; he flies right over our chimneys all day long. . ." (Summer 1929? Tuesday, Long Island; Box Man-9, Folder 11). [Adelina Pati might be a reference to the diva Adelina Patti, a singer from Wales who was a superstar of the second half of the 19th century.]

Charles Mitchell, the Chairman of National City Bank, and Gordon's mentor, arrives for dinner by boat to their Locust Valley home on Long Island; Mary is so bored she goes to town to shop; Cravath, of the law firm of Paul Cravath, lives next door, and the Rentschler's groom leads Faith around on her horse named Popcorn; in addition, a neighbor's son practices his flying lessons overhead.

By the fall/winter of 1929 the situation has changed:

"C.W.A. has just laid off 40% of its workers. Much of its last appropriation has to go for back pay, I understand. It is a ghastly mess—and all the money which might have kept us going for two or three years—spent &amp; nothing but debts in its place. . . I can hardly keep my mind off it what these people who have to say 'no' all day go through makes me shiver. On the other hand you get so annoyed with people who have lived &amp; worked here 30 years &amp; never paid a tax or taken out citizenship papers even. Well—fortunately we are having a meeting of our local committee tomorrow—our private unemployment Comm.—not C.W.A." (Friday Locust Valley, NY, Fall/Winter 1929; Box Man-9, Folder 11).

The disastrous economic condition of the country, although acknowledged and bemoaned in the letters, does not appear to affect the family materially. Details of family life continue with news of birthdays, sickness, parties, and vacations. Mary writes to Katherine from the Moisie River Fishing Club in Quebec, Canada, where the family loved to vacation. Referring to Faith, Mary writes: "She has Gordon right under her thumb—he is very weak minded. He loved her before but since Phoebe has been talking &amp; calling him "Daddy" Faith—very tentatively at first—tried it, &amp; that completely finished his subjugation" (1931 July 10; Box Man-10, Folder 7).

By 1933 the banking scandals are seeping into the correspondence and provide evidence of the agony that Gordon Rentschler suffered. Mary writes to her mother-in-law in Belmont, Massacusetts, from New York's Savoy Plaza:

 ". . . if it only weren't for the hurt of the injustice to Charlie &amp; Hugh. It is sort of like the war—if you were there, there is no need to explain &amp; if you weren't there is no use trying to explain the feelings &amp; experiences of that kind of an investigation by a group of men—a jury maybe?—who have already said 'guilty' (February 1933; Box Man-10, Folder 9).

The sometimes strained letters from her family in North America are in contrast to the letters from the Atkins plantation in Cuba of the same period. The correspondence reflects a life divided between a love of Cuba and her native home in North America. In March of 1933, shortly after the birth of her daughter Susan Helen, she received the following letter from "Daddy" [Llewelyn] Hughes, the plantation manager:

"My dear Mary, We were all delighted at hearing from you, it is fine that you and little Susan Helen are getting on so well. Gordon was very kind, as he always is, in sending us the cable and you may be sure we were all so glad to hear that everything was well. Mummy &amp; I are 'thinking' of returning north but so far we have not got beyond that stage, it is so lovely here, we have had a few showers and the fields are turning green once more. Spring time in Cuba and particularly in Soledad cannot be beaten, the nights &amp; early mornings are cool even if the days are a bit hot. How happy we'd be if conditions were better— Our crop came to a forced stop last Friday, we had finished our quota, 53,000 bags, only three years in the last 40 has Soledad had such a small crop, they were 1896, '97 &amp; '98. The revolution days, and even then we made over 47,000 bags and a profit! In 1893 Soledad made 56,164 and went to nearly 70,000 the next year—well, it is no use worrying over spilt milk, we must see what can be done for the future. Things certainly look brighter than a year ago and we all feel encouraged, even though we cannot step-out much this summer. Our trouble here is that we have so very little work for the people, we have not finished cutting the fields that were not cut in 1932, so cannot do much field work as, I suppose, we will have another restricted crop in 1934, for 1935 Soledad and everyone else that is still in the ring will have to prepare a crop of moderate proportions. My guess is that nobody will go wild planting for some years. I hope not anyway. I have given Bill Leonard your message about the Beef, he will attend to it and many thanks Mary on behalf of the poor people that will get one square meal that day. It surprises me that the country people are as well as they certainly look. There has been some difficulty about clothes &amp; shoes but Mrs. Atkins has done a lot and I don't believe there has been any real hunger, at least on Soledad, these early rains will allow people to get in their corn &amp; other plantings a month earlier than last year. You would be astonished to see the amount of stuff that is grown by the work? people and if they only keep it up after conditions improve the depression will have done much good, it has always been so difficult to get people to plant for themselves as you will remember. Sincerely yours, Daddy Hughes" (1933 April 11; Box Man-10, Folder 12).

This letter beautifully evokes the arrival of spring in Cuba as well as the growing economic and political crisis that by August would become a Revolution. The figures provide useful statistics to measure sugar cane production. The restricted crop refers to the quotas on sugar manufacture, the result of government efforts to stem the falling price of sugar.

Daddy Hughes and Katherine W. Atkins wrote descriptive accounts of Cuba from 1933–1941. In a letter written in April 1938 Hughes expresses his concern that family-run plantations will disappear as Government-run organizations will take over the sugar industry. In response to a request as to what Mary can do to help rural women, he suggests teaching them hygiene and childcare. He also suggests paying to transport children to the church schools in the local large town of Cienfuegos as the local government schools are unsatisfactory. We read that as Cuban law prohibited the employment of children under the age of sixteen and children finished school at about fourteen years of age, the estate might hire teachers to instruct the children for the interim. After all, the boys who were "running wild" would be their "future workmen" (1938 April 19; Box Man-10, Folder 12).

The rural poverty is even more evident in the letters of Katherine W. Atkins. Her in-depth descriptions provide a dramatic, clear picture:

"I was told in fact the grandmother who is the caretaker in the school begged me for shoes for the family of her son. The men told me they were no good, had had shoes and didn't come then so I went up to the house to investigate. They live in the last house on the ridge as you go out to the crossing. There was the sickest baby there you ever saw the head looked like a skull with the skin drawn over it and one leg was swelled to double its size with what looked like a gigantic water blister. Four other children, a small girl and three older boys, the house a mess and a big plank gone from the porch. Slack beyond words of course but could you blame them, they say he is always empanado in the store and as soon as he gets out of debt there is a bill for medicine. Mr. Mackenzie spoke as if he blamed him for that but what can the poor people do. I saw at least four bottles of patent medicine and baby food in the house, I would do it myself if my baby was ill. . . .the doctor is coming to inject the whole school for typhoid this morning so Good bye lessons and I think sewing class, last week when they had the first injection they were 'fainting and writhing in coils' all over the Batey poor little things. . . . One old nig, one of the two or three very old ones had her house blown down in the cyclone. I don't know why they promised to rebuild that house (there were two living in it then) as it was in Cienfuegos but they apparently did. Before it was begun one died and the other one has been here at intervals ever since. I though she wanted a place at Rosario where she is now living with her daughter and the other day we met up with Fernando while she was talking and much to my surprise he offered to take her to the store with my vale and then told her he could see to the house. Yesterday he denied having ever told her anything when asked by Bill or Wilfrid I am not sure of many things but I know I heard him tell her he would fix it for I was greatly surprised. We may get something for her later" (1940 March 13, Wednesday; Box Man-10, Folder 12).


The letters remain interspersed with news of the family. The letters reveal that Mary and Gordon assisted many members of their family when the occasion arose. Julia C. Deane enlisted her sister's help when Isabel needed medical assistance (1936 January 18; Box Man-9, Folder 12). Mary collected correspondence that was written to her by her children and the collection contains a large number of letters written from 1935 to 1947 by Faith, Phoebe, Mary (Mimi), and Susan. In 1938 Faith went on a summer vacation to the Diamond G. Ranch in Dubois, Wyoming. A wonderful glimpse of the young elite is provided by Faith's letters home from her vacation. In addition, there are interesting letters from the children's aunt and uncle, Helen and Sidney Waldon, with whom they often stayed for summer holidays. In one instance, Sidney write:

"Yesterday I saw Sue putting the dice in the box with the 1's upward. She would then shake the box sideways so as not to disturb the arrangement, and then upend the box so that she had double 6's. She varied the technique by sometimes using double 3's or 5's. Naturally she beat her sisters all to pieces. Later on she confided to me that if she used that trick with other people it would be cheating, but of course it was quite all right in playing against Mimi and Phoebe who are so much larger than she" (1939 July 14; Box Man-11, Folder 8).


The arrival of war barely changes the tone or content of the letters in the collection, with the exception of Katherine Atkins, who remarks on war work and takes an interest in the news:

". . . the Duponts came over in the morning for breakfast, they wanted to go to the Garden but a heavy shower came up right after breakfast and they concluded to go home for fear they could not get there later. . . .The Radio news that we can get is most disturbing, the only consolation is that it may not be true, peace with Finland, Turkey wavering toward Germany, the Balkans forced to throw in their lot with Russia, England torn by internal dissension, and only Sumner Welles to stem the tide" (1940 March 13; Box Man-10, Folder 12). [The Duponts were manufacturers of munitions. Edwin F. Atkins, Sr. created a garden in 1901 near the Soledad plantation to study sugarcane. The garden was donated to Harvard University in 1919 and operated by them until after the U.S. embargo was imposed in 1961. Sumner Welles (1892–1961) was an American diplomat. In 1940 Welles was the Undersecretary of State and took part in the mid-Atlantic meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt. In 1933 he was unable to mediate an agreement between the opposing groups in the revolution against Gerardo Machado in Cuba.]

Other correspondence of interest includes: a fascinating travel diary by Benjamin Clapp, 1811–1812 (Box Man-13, Folder 6); a letter from Dr. Josephine Kenyon, Mary's doctor, recommending thyroid medication, exercise, and painting (1938 February 4; Box Man-11, Folder 7); letters from Charles A. Coolidge, Jr. and Julia C. Deane describing a September 1938 storm that hit the northeast coast of the United States (Box Man-11, Folder 6); correspondence from Mary to Gordon from Helen Waldon's home in Michigan, upon the death of Sidney D. Waldon in January 1945 (Box Man-12, Folder 10); correspondence to and from Frederick B. Rentschler, a founder of the Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft company and Gordon Rentschler's brother (1948–1956; Box Man-12, Folder 14); a letter sent from Cuba by Helen Claflin describing the dangers of childbirth in that country in 1958 (Box Man-13, Folder 4); finally, individual letters from Winston Churchill's secretary (Box 12, Folder 16), J. C. Penney (Box Man-13, Folder 3), and Bernard Baruch (Box Man-12, Folder 15).

Genealogical material

Genealogical materials related to Mary Rentschler's branch of the family, i.e., Atkins, Carleton, Coolidge, Shepley, Shurtleff, have been amassed at the end of Subseries I.B materials. Folders 2 and 8 in Box Man-14 originated with the David H. Coolidge, Sr. materials and were added to these records for ease of access.

These materials provide biographical materials necessary to construct the family tree and chronological information on the family. Box Man-14, Folder 11, contains a photographic copy of an essay written by Louise Lionberger Amory (no date) about summer vacations at the turn of the 19th century in Marion, Massachusetts, at the home of Mary Augusta Clapp Shepley (also known as Ama), Mary C. Rentschler's grandmother.</field>
