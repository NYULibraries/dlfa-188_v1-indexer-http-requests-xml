    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These materials include wills, mortgages, correspondence, diaries, scrapbooks, and commission certificates mostly dating from the second half of the nineteenth century. They reflect both a huge pride and love for his family and a prominent standing and involvement in the legal profession and civic life.

Coolidge's papers include a large number of documents concerning his immediate and ancestral family. Numerous genealogies, obituaries, and historical letters written by distant family members attest to his interest and pride in the accomplishments of his family. The oldest documents in the entire collection are among these materials, they are a promissory note and mortgage dated 1793 and 1796, respectively. The realty document for a property on Milk Street in Boston belonged to his grandfather David Hill (Box Ovz-1). Other items of note include a copy of the will of his maternal grandfather, David Hill (1837 March 8), as well as an abstract of the will of his paternal grandfather, Jonas Coolidge (1860 March 16) (Box Man-2, Folder 5).

Three scrapbooks include invitations and press clippings surrounding events involving Coolidge's immediate family. Loose correspondence contained in the scrapbooks was removed to adjacent file folders. Among the correspondence are letters concerning the betrothal of his sons David H. Coolidge, Jr. to Harriet S. Crowninshield, and Frederick S. Coolidge to Elizabeth Sprague. Elizabeth Sprague's mother writes poignantly of her anxiety over separating from her daughter (Box Man-1, Folder 6). Correspondence from his son, David H. Coolidge, Jr., in the Caribbean in 1898 provides a glimpse of life there at the time of the Spanish-American War. The young Coolidge complains of his wife's extravagance (Box Man-1, Folder 3).

Civic involvement is attested to by the twenty commission certificates spanning from 1858 to 1906. These include appointments as Justice of the Peace, master of Chancery, and Commissioner of Insolvency in Massachusetts, as well as Commissioner for the States of Maine and Michigan, and membership of the Board of Trustees of the Hospital Cottages for Children in Boston (Box Ovz-1 and Ovz-2). Coolidge's three scrapbooks are filled with press clippings of local civic news, as well as domestic and foreign affairs. For example: a report of the battle of Gettysburg; an electricity exhibition conceived of by Coolidge and George S. Hale; administration of Boston's City Hospital with an item petitioning admission of female students; judicial abuses in Italy (Box Man-1, Folder 4). Finally, letters he received from Congressman W. W. Warren in 1875 and 1876 indicate firsthand knowledge of Washington politics. The letters discuss currency and the gold standard, as well as impeachment, corruption, and electioneering (Box Man-2, Folder 7).

The scrapbooks contain an eclectic group of materials. Aside from those previously mentioned, other items of interest include: a tiny and beautiful notebook of his scholastic record at his alma mater, Harvard University (Box Man-2, Folder 10); programs and press clippings concerning Arlington Street Unitarian Church to which he belonged (Box Man-2, Folder 15); a silk menu (Box Man-1, Folder 3); a handwritten poem to him on his seventeenth birthday, with miniscule photographs of women attached (Box Man-2, Folder 11); innumerable printed poems (Box Man-3, Folder 2), and a bill of safe passage for himself and R. C. Billings in the Civil War south (Box Man-1, Folder 4). (Billings became a very successful Boston businessman.)

His diverse interests and the papers he chose to keep reflect a civic-minded and successful Bostonian and provide a wealth of information from which to create a family genealogy.</field>
