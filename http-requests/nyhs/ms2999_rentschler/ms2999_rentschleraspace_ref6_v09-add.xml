    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Helen Rentschler Waldon was born in 1890, the only daughter of Phoebe Schwab Rentschler and George Adam Rentschler Sr. The bulk of the correspondence in this group was written to her by her family and reflects her primary role as a dutiful daughter and loyal sibling and wife. On September 29, 1906, Phoebe wrote to Helen at the Ogontz School in Pennsylvania: "Well my dear daughter be a good child as you always have been let no one lead you astray, but be the same true simple little girl you always have been" (Box Man-22, Folder 2). Helen's formal education, away from home, indicates an egalitarian attitude toward a female child, albeit couched in traditional patronizing language. Three years later her mother counsels thriftiness in economic hard times, and we indirectly learn that her father, George Adam Rentschler Sr., enjoyed privileged information as a bank official:

"You know Papa is always much concerned about his people especially the little shop &amp; he takes it upon himself to help them keep the wolf from their doors. No doubt there will be much suffering among the working classes. In fact money is so scarce that it is wise for all classes to be watchful &amp; saving. Things are more serious than the newspapers tell, but it is wise for the papers to make light of it, for it would scare those who have their savings in the banks &amp; cause much trouble. The banks of Hamilton are solid &amp; people have no need to fear, but then it is hard to make them understand &amp; believe when they have their all placed in safe keeping. Papa is in a position to know the circumstances, as he is a director in two Hamilton banks &amp; on the inside workings of the other three. . . . So my dear child do your share of economical financing too" (circa 1908/9; Box Man-22, Folder 2).

Helen's own letters to Gordon and Mary (in other parts of the collection) are often sentimental, and although there is a dearth of information, one senses that duty to her family superseded personal aspirations for many years; especially perhaps as she was the first female of the house after her mother died in 1916. There is a paucity of correspondence from non-family members. Extant letters include correspondence from Ohio friends Don and Cyrus Fitton and Brant Elliott, stationed in Europe during World War I (Box Man-22, Folder 3); as well as colorful letters written by Lee Olwell traveling in Singapore and China in 1926 (Box Man-22, Folder 8).

In August 1922 her father wrote to her in Biddeford, Maine:

"Everything is going along nicely. I am feeling about the same as I did when you left. The house is very lonesome without you. Gordon hasn't come back yet, and Bud is away most of the time. I hope you will enjoy every minute of your stay there, in as short a time as you can. You can't come home any too son. With my sincere love to you" (Box Man-22, Folder 5).

Her absence is keenly felt and the letter contains a barely disguised command to return home. Again, it suggests that Helen's first obligation is to her father and her home. Helen had a particularly strong relationship with her brother Gordon. In 1927, a month before his wedding to Mary, Gordon wrote the following:

"Nothing can ever take you away from me. Mama gave you to me when we started off to country school one bright May day away back in 1896 when you were a wee small girl. And ever since and always you will be my own dearest Diddy, baby sister, dearest daughter &amp; great life inspiration. God has given three great women to my life. Our dear little Mama, my own darling Diddy and my Mary. . . . You know how proud I am of you and how I adore you. . . ." (Box Man-22, Folder 9).

It is as a mirror to others that her material is so valuable. Subseries I.D contains the only notable letters from her eldest brother, Robert P. Rentschler. In 1906 Robert wrote to his sister about a parade at Princeton University attended by United States President Theodore Roosevelt and University President Woodrow Wilson, the future President of the United States. He jokes at the "comic" seriousness of the parade (Box Man-22, Folder 2). Similarly, in the summer of 1927, Gordon wrote a letter to his sister referring to their brother Bud's (George Adam Rentschler Jr.) marriage to a stage performer. [George Adam Rentschler Jr. divorced his first wife, Joan Baker, in 1936, and subsequently married Rita Rend Mitchell, the daughter of National City Bank Chairman Charles Mitchell.] This letter is unusual as it articulates Gordon's sadness and intimate feelings—a rare occurrence within this body of materials (other than love for Mary). In addition, we indirectly learn of Gordon's sense of responsibility toward his siblings and witness a measure of self-reflection (B Box Man-22, Folder 9). The insight that this letter affords is repeated on a happier occasion aboard an ocean liner traveling from New York to Europe:

"We duly celebrated the advance beyond the dear old Goddess of Liberty by holding quite a ceremony over Marion's caviar and the things that she told me that really belonged with good caviar, and inasmuch as this was good caviar, and had a long hard trip all the way from Russia in order to attend our party, we saw to it that its good friends, Gordon Gin and Bacardy attended the party. I think Marion is really responsible for giving this whole party a good start, because it was the excuse to get the crowd down in my room and get on a basis in ten minutes, which ordinarily requires the most serious part of ten days. . . . the friends are the kind I usually find, the ones who look slick and come by it naturally" (On board the SS Majestic, 1926 September 1; Box Man-22, Folder 8).

The polite and conventional voice that resonates in Helen's letters remains largely intact after she marries and continues with her own life. However, the treatment her brother received during the banking scandals of the 1930s enraged her:

"It is all so unfair, and of course what sticks out foremost in my mind is that awful statement made by that dreadful person called Senator Cousins, and made to me by him in my house. I wish I could testify to that extent. I have Mary Crews to bear witness to his statement about what he proposed to do to make votes for 'we senators.' Cousins is about as popular as a rattlesnake in Detroit right now, since he has to xxx record, the fact that he was the sole member of the committee who refused to sanction the R.F.C. [Reconstruction Finance Committee] loan to save our banking situation. May justice be dealt him some day!" (1933 February 27; Box Man-10, Folder 8—Mary C. Rentschler materials).

In 1928, at the age of thirty-eight, Helen married Sidney Dunn Waldon, an expert in the aeronautical and automotive industries. [This was Sidney D. Waldon's second marriage. His first marriage was to Lois Burton of Erie, Pennsylvania. They had a daughter, Maunee (Mrs. Maunee Streit).] Born in Great Britain in 1873, Sidney D. Waldon emigrated to America in 1893. He subsequently had a long engineering career. Helen R. Waldon's papers include photocopies of letters from several of the companies that Waldon worked for, including photocopies of letters from J. M. Packard of the Packard Motor Car Company, 1900–1919 (Box Man-22, Folder 1). He joined the company in 1902 and became a vice president at Packard in 1910. In 1933 Henry B. Joy, a Packard Car Company executive, wrote the following to Sidney: "A certain manufacturing outfit would not be on the map today if it were not for you good self, chiefly, and the other good soldiers who enabled me to win the undying fame (now forgotten) of having put Packard out in front" (1933 November 24; Box Man-22, Folder 12). After the Packard Motor Car Company moved to Detroit, Michigan, from Warren, Ohio, circa 1903, Waldon became interested in the street railway system of that city and fought vigorously, but unsuccessfully, to have a subway system built.

In 1915 Waldon resigned from Packard to become an executive and an engineer with the Cadillac Motor Company, where he remained for a year. In 1916 he left Cadillac to aid the Government, and during 1917 and 1918 he was one of the principal engineering aides in the nascent United States air force. He helped design the Liberty Engine in Washington, D.C. in 1916. Through his enthusiasm for aviation he became a friend of Orville Wright. [News clippings of a committee to create landing strips and airports, headed by Orville Wright in 1919, are in Box Man-24, Folder 3. Orville Wright was also a friend of Gordon S. Rentschler and Colonel E. A. Deeds. They all drove across the United States in 1919.] Helen Waldon's letters include a personal one from Katherine Wright, Orville's sister, who describes a comical boating mishap on vacation in Ontario, Canada, in August 1922 (Box Man-22, Folder 5). Throughout his life, Sidney D. Waldon was an avid "amateur" photographer. Beautiful panoramic photographs from a 1919 Packard road trip out west can be found in Box Man-5-through-9 (albums/framed photograph boxes); and extraordinary photographs from a road trip across Africa, 1924–1925, are located in Box Man-10 of the same group. Diaries from the African trip were removed to Box Mem-55 and Box Mem-56, and related correspondence is found in Box Man-22, Folder 7, of the manuscript collection.

Sidney D. Waldon and Helen R. Waldon built a home they named Pine Knob in Clarkston, Michigan, in 1928, the year they were married. [A diary written by Sidney D. Waldon describing the construction of Pine Knob in 1928 can be found in Box Man-22, Folder 10. Dedication booklets for the home are in Box Man-22, Folder 21.] The main building of this 820-acre estate was in the style of an English manor. Pine Knob was the focal point of many social gatherings of their group of friends called the "Wing Lakers," as well as a summer destination for their nieces—Phoebe, Mary (Mimi), and Susan Rentschler. The Waldons lived here until 1941, when they moved to Hamilton, Ohio. In Ohio Sidney worked as a treasurer and director for the General Machinery Corporation (a Rentschler concern) until he died in 1945. Four years later, Helen sold Pine Knob to the Henry Ford Hospital [see Box Man-23, Folder 7, for the real estate brochure advertising Pine Knob] and moved into the Hamilton, Ohio farm that she leased from her sister-in-law, Mary C. Rentschler [see Box Man-22, Folder 17, for the lease]. The farm reverted back to Mary C. Rentschler in 1967, when Helen died. [An inventory of furnishings and art at Pine Knob and the Hamilton Farm can be found in Box Man-23, Folders 5 &amp; 6, and Parke-Bernet, New York auction catalogs list items sent to auction.]</field>
