    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of 90 laminated proofs and advertisements created by the Gilbert Agency in the 1960's and 1970's.  The advertisements are arranged by client/product names, which are specifically identified in the box and folder list. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Emblematic of the "creative revolution" that changed the face of advertising in the 1960's, these ads are characterized by humor, irony and irreverence.  Notable examples include an After Six advertisement offering Russian Premier Alexi Kosygin a free tuxedo ("For you, we'll make it up in red"); a Renault ad pitched to "people who swore they would never buy another one"; and a London Fog ad picturing a man and a woman on an ark full of animals (mostly borrowed from the 1964 World's Fair African exhibit) with the tagline "When it looks like rain, believe in London Fog."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection provides an interesting window into the popular culture of the 1960's and early 1970's.  It also reflects the social issues of the time, in particular the anti-war movement, which features in several advertising campaigns (Some Toys Don't Like War, for Georg Jensen, and a series of political ads urging a vote on the war). </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Richard L. Gilbert was born in the Bronx on March 23, 1921.  After attending DeWitt Clinton High School and City College of New York, he was drafted into the Army in 1942.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After his discharge from the Army in 1946, Gilbert returned to New York, working various jobs in the advertising industry.  In 1950, Gilbert opened his own firm, Gilbert Advertising, in an office on West 31st Street. Over the next 40 years, Gilbert's firm compiled an impressive roster of high-profile clients, including Anne Klein, London Fog, Renault, and the Metropolitan Opera. Although it remained a small agency, the firm created some high-impact ad campaigns, most notably Some Toys Hate War, an anti-Vietnam war-themed ad for silversmith Georg Jensen.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">More information about Gilbert's career can be found in his memoir, Marching Up Madison Avenue, also held in the collection. Originally published in 2008, the book was re-issued in 2013 with the title I Was a Mad Man: A Madison Avenue Memoir.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">A long-time resident of the Bronx neighborhood Riverdale, Gilbert became a frequent contributor to the "Point of View" column in the Riverdale Press after retiring from advertising.  He died at home on December 29, 2013.</field>
