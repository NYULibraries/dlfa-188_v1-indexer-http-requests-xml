    <field name="scopecontent_teim">101 color 8x10 inch photographs of Central Park scenes. The photos are undated, but in his transmittal the donor/photographer noted that they dated from 1991-1994, with most taken in 1991-92. The photographs are of both the park's natural elements (foliage, rock formations (including detailed close-ups of rock textures and colors), lawns, waterfalls, lakes/ponds) and built environment (statuary (including Alice in Wonderland), bridges (including Bow Bridge), fountains (including Bethesda), lampposts, walkways, benches, roads, gazebos). Familiar sites (Bethesda, Alice in Wonderland, Bow Bride) are represented, but most of the views are of the more typical general views of park features. Certainly not typical of the park is that the photographs are notably devoid of people and animals, even at popular spots such as the Mall and Belvedere Castle), thereby focusing on the park itself. The photos also include several that include the buildings just outside the park, with the park's features as foreground. All four seasons of the year are represented so many photos capture the park in the white of snow and in autumn colors, as well as the lush green of summer and the color of spring blooms.</field>
