    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes the minutes of the monthly Board of Managers meetings, as well as annual general meetings, from 1895 through 1988, and 1998. The minutes contain discussions of the current business of the organization, reports of various committees, and upcoming elections. These transcripts also provide details about the death of members, issues related to membership requirements and applications, and planning for events, trips, and fundraising efforts for scholarships. Minutes are divided into two subseries:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries I.A. is comprised of typescripts that are housed in their original binders. The date range is 1895 to 1964. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries I.B. consists of one handwritten minute book documenting meetings from 1904-1911, as well as folders of minutes arranged chronologically. The date range is 1895-1998, and the series includes a mix of handwritten minutes, original typed minutes and photocopies.</field>
