    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Daughters of the Cincinnati is a hereditary lineage organization founded in 1894 by female descendants of American Revolutionary War officers. The organization's stated purpose is to advance and encourage the study of the history of the Revolution, and its main philanthropic aim is to provide college scholarships to the daughters of current military officers. To be eligible for membership, applicants must prove that they are descended from an original member of the Society of Cincinnati, or a Revolutionary War officer who met the requirements for membership.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Daughters of the Cincinnati was incorporated in New York State on Dec. 27, 1894, 111 years after the founding of the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization which does not admit female members.  The Society of the Cincinnati was founded in 1783 by officers of the Continental Army and their French counterparts who served together in the American Revolution. The organization took its name from the ancient Roman hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, whom they considered the embodiment of civic virtue. The primary aims of the Society of Cincinnati were to perpetuate the memory of the Revolutionary War and promote the ideals of the Revolution, and to provide support for members and their families.  In order to perpetuate their organization and its aims, the founders made membership hereditary.  Hereditary members of the Society of the Cincinnati are qualified male descendants of commissioned officers who served in the Continental Army or Navy. </field>
