    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records include requests for photographs from Time Inc.'s collection; requests for rights to reproduce photographs taken by photographers working for Life to use in exhibitions; requests from the United States Information Agency (previously United States Information Service) for Time Life International to prepare exhibitions for it such as American Arts and Skills and the Shelburne Museum; memoranda and correspondence regarding installation and shipping; exhibition catalogs, guides, and brochures; news clippings; and some photographs of installed exhibits. The records are primarily from Jim Alberse and Jeanne Kerr with some from Ed Lumsden.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Unreformatted audiovisual material in the collection is not accessible.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The management of the offsite and traveling exhibitions and loans started with Ed Lumsden and Jim Alberse in the promotion office of Time Life International (TLI). TLI became Corporate International in 1968 with Alberse in the public affairs office continuing management along with his assistant Jeanne Kerr. By 1969, Corporate International no longer existed as a department, and Alberse and Kerr transferred to Corporate Public Affairs still overseeing the international exhibitions and loans.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Exhibitions in this collection were shown internationally and were either organized by Time Inc. or included loans from its collection. Exhibitions were to promote Time Inc. and its publications on an international scale or to promote specific aspects such as a new international publication like Life South Pacific or Life Asia. Based on the creators of the records, these exhibitions were managed separately from those shown in the Reception Center or Exhibition Center in the Time &amp; Life Building, although some exhibitions were shown both onsite and traveled.</field>
