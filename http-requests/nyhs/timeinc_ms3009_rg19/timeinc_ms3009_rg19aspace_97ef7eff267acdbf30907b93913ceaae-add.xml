    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1949-1972</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records document exhibitions shown in the public spaces of the the Time &amp; Life Building at 9 Rockefeller Plaza and in the new Time &amp; Life Building at 1271 Avenue of the Americas in the Rockefeller Center. The majority of files document exhibitions at the second building with one folder listing exhibitions from the first building. Included are some files discussing sculpture in the plaza.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records come from Bernard Barnes, head of Corporate Special Projects, and his assistants Richard Amill, John Wingerter, John C. Byers, Elizabeth Hanson, and Wells Walker; and Edgar P. Smith, assistant to the Time Inc. president. The majorty of later files come from Hanson in her role as Exhibition Hall Manager with some from Bernard Yudain, the assistant to the Time Inc. president in regards to public affairs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is some overlap of exhibitions represented in the records kept by Time Life International/Corporate International on the international traveling exhibitions in this record group and by the Promotion and Public Affairs Department in the Time Publishing and Business Records.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Time Inc. displayed exhibitions in public areas of their offices at the Time &amp; Life Building at 9 Rockefeller Plaza and in the new Time &amp; Life Building at 1271 Avenue of the Americas in the Rockefeller Center. The public areas are referred to as the Reception Center, Exhibit Hall, and Exhibition Center. It isn't clear if these are three separate areas or if they are areas with several names. were renamed.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Some exhibitions showcase Time Inc.'s history or photographs produced by Time Inc. magazines. Exhibitions may be organized by one of the Time Inc. magazines, may be co-organized by Time Inc. and an outside group, or may be a loan of a traveling exhibition from another institution. Several early exhibitions came from the American Federation of Arts.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Based on the creators of the records, exhibitions in the Reception Center, exhibit Hall, or Exhibition Center in the Time &amp; Life Building were managed separately from the traveling exhibitions used for promotion, although there is some exhibits were reprised for travel.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Several people and offices oversaw the organization and implementation of the exhibitions including Bernard Barnes, head of Corporate Special Projects, along with his assistants over time Richard Amill, John Wingerter, John C. Byers, Elizabeth Hanson, and Wells Walker; Edgar P. Smith, assistant to the Time Inc. president; and Bernard Yudain, the assistant to the Time Inc. president in regards to public affairs. By 1968 Barnes is no longer with Time Inc., and Hanson is now in the Central Services Division (later renamed Company Services) as Exhibition Hall manager. By 1972, she is no longer with Company Services, but the Exhibition Hall is still managed as part of this division.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">These files are located within the Corporate Public Affairs record group because the earliest version of Corporate Publicity was overseen by the head of Corporate Special Projects according to the Time Inc. Department Head Lists, and an archives transfer form indicates some of the material from Exhibition Center exhibits was the property of Corporate Public Affairs. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1970 Time Inc. creates the department Corporate Public Affairs. By 1978 Corporate Public Affairs includes Corporate Creative Services which, among other tasks, oversaw exhibits in the Time Inc. buildings or traveling exhibits sponsored by Time Inc. Around 1986, Corporate Cultural Affairs is created, which may have replaced Creative Services, fully focusing on exhibits.</field>
