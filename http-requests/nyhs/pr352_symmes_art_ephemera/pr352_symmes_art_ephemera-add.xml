    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection includes about 3,000 art gallery and museum announcements, posters, brochures, checklists, and other documents obtained by prints and drawings curator Marilyn F. Symmes, mostly from the 1990s-2019. Most of the material relates to modern and contemporary one-artist exhibitions, though two-artist and group exhibitions, including those with themed titles, are also represented. Most of the collection includes materials from New York City art galleries and museums, though institutions elsewhere in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in other countries are also represented.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes about 3,000 announcements, guides, brochures, checklists, artwork images, booklet catalogues, and posters from galleries, dealers and museums related to art exhibitions. These materials were either mailed to graphic arts curator Marilyn Symmes or obtained by her when visiting an exhibition. The bulk of the documents/exhibitions date from the 1990s to 2019, when Symmes was working at Cooper Hewitt in New York and later the Zimmerli at Rutgers. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the collection contains documents related to modern and contemporary one-artist exhibitions. These exhibitions primarily included paintings, sculpture, video, photography, prints, drawings, and installations, with some architecture, design, and textiles. Many artists are represented by only one or two documents, while others include multiple documents. Both well-recognized names and less well known artists are found in the collection. The container list attempts to identify at the folder level those artists represented with more extensive or substantive content.  Two-artist and group exhibitions, including those with themed titles, are also in the collection. 
Overall, as Symmes described the content when donating the collection to N-YHS, "The collection presents in microcosm a significant record of modern and contemporary artists whose work was exhibited during this period [1991-2019] primarily in New York City. This collection provides some insight into subjects, issues, materials, styles explored by artists as presented in these exhibitions—thereby reflecting a significant sampling of cultural and social concerns during this time period, as well as commercial interests of the American dealers."</field>
