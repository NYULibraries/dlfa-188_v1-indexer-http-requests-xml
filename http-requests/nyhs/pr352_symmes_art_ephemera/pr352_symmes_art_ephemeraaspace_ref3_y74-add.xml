    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes announcements, guides, brochures, checklists, artwork images, booklet catalogues, and posters from galleries, dealers and museums related to exhibitions centered on the work of one particular artist. The term "catalogue" is used loosely here and refers to a broad range of textual forms intended to provide some level of substantive insight into the content of an exhibition. By the donor's count, there are approximately 2,300 items in this series. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list identifies some, though certainly not all or even most, of the artists represented in a particular folder of documents. Generally, artists were noted if there were several documents related to them or if the documents, even if only one was present, included substantive textual information, such as a checklist, description of artistic purpose, gallery layout, or biographical information. While acknowledging the subjective nature of the effort, an attempt was made to document within the container list where one could find brochure or booklet-type catalogues or other such documents concerning particular exhibitions. Researchers will no doubt find other useful documents within the folders, particularly high quality brochures emphasizing select artwork images or creatively designed gallery mailings, but not all artists and documents could be itemized in this finding aid within the constraints of processing resources.</field>
