    <field name="scopecontent_teim">After the mid-1920's, the American Institute began to focus on science programs for children. This subseries contains information on the children's programs, workshops, and clubs that were sponsored by the American Institute.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Science Fairs - The first American Institute Children's Science Fair was held in 1928 in conjunction with the School Nature League at the American Museum of Natural History. The first fairs encouraged the study of agriculture, nature, and conservation. The fairs were held in the fall from 1928-1933. In 1934, the fair was moved to the spring and, because of the shift, there was no Children's Fair for that year. The fairs became popular and the large demand for exhibit space meant that the American Institute eventually had to limit the number of entries from each school. In 1938 the fair was renamed as the Junior Science Fair, and the name was changed to the Science and Engineering Fair in 1939. These fairs were no longer affiliated with the School Nature League and the exhibits became more technical. Although it is unclear when the American Institute fairs ended, the material documents the fairs until 1983.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The fairs from 1928-1939 are well documented but there is not much information on the fairs from 1940-1983. The material includes correspondence, judges reports, booklets, regulations, entries, vouchers, lists of prize winners, information on Parents Night, descriptions of the exhibits, and details of arrangements needed to set up the exhibits.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Science Clubs - With the success of the annual science fairs, the American Institute sought to establish a way for children to pursue their scientific interests all year round. The Institute created a Junior Science Club that consisted of existing science clubs sponsored by schools or other organizations. Children could not join individually. Members would be invited to participate in lectures, field trips, meetings, workshop courses, and museum courses. The American Institute science clubs were local to the New York City region until 1938 when the American Institute established a nationwide organization of clubs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Material pertaining to the Science Clubs includes correspondence, reports, and membership items. There is also information on the planning of events including correspondence with speakers, course descriptions, sign-in sheets, applications, schedules, and lists of participants. There is little information on the activities of clubs outside of New York City or on any club activities after 1940. Publications of the science clubs included March of Science (1932-1937), Science Leaflet (1934, 1939-1941), Amateur Scientist (1937-1938), and The Science Observer (1938-1941). These publications are located in Series 4: Pamphlets and Publications.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Science Congress - The Science Congress was an annual series of scientific meetings for members of the Junior Science Clubs. The congress was modeled on the scientific meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the adult meetings of the American Institute. Beginning in 1933, junior and senior high school students lectured, read scientific papers, and gave demonstrations of their work at the congress. In 1934, Christmas lectures modeled on the Christmas series at the Royal Institution of London became part of the congress which was held at the end of each year. Some of the Christmas Lectures were broadcast on the radio by NBC. There is no material on the Science Congress from 1940-1966. Material for a 1967 Junior Academy Science Congress is included in this subseries. It is unclear if the Science Congresses continued after that time. The Science Congress material includes applications to the congress, the topics of the talks and demonstrations of the students, ticket information, and attendance records.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Accent on Science - This was a short-lived American Institute weekly radio program that ran on WNYC in 1937. It was a fifteen-minute segment that consisted of conversations with members of the science community on various topics including chemical warfare, telescopes, the cures and causes of syphilis and gonorrhea, and the proper food to serve on airlines. The material includes transcripts of most of the shows and correspondence regarding plans for the program.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Scholastic Salon of Photography The Scholastic Salon of Photography was originally part of the Children's Science Fair, but it became a separate event in 1938 due to its popularity. Sponsored by the American Institute and several camera clubs from New York City schools, students from across the country submitted photographs to the salon and prizes were awarded to the winners. Prize winning photographs and selected entries were placed on display at the American Museum of Natural History. After the second salon, the winning photographs traveled to schools around the country for display. The Salon material includes brochures, correspondence, planning material, and publicity information for 1938-1940. Only a few photographs from the salons are in the collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Science Laboratory - After the success of the student laboratory at the 1939-1940 World's Fair, the American Institute started a permanent laboratory where students could experiment on their own outside of school. The lab was located in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue. By late December of 1941, the lab was closed due to a lack of funds. The material includes administrative information, correspondence, photographs, and examples of experiments performed in the laboratory.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Crime Prevention Bureau Courses - In 1933, the American Institute sponsored courses to officers of the Crime Prevention Bureau of the New York Police Department on establishing science clubs. The NYPD hoped that establishing science clubs, similar to their establishment of athletic activities, would help prevent juvenile delinquency. There is administrative material on the planning of these courses and events, with evaluations on of their progress.</field>
