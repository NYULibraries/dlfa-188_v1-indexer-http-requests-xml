    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries 1: Annual Fairs, 1828-1926</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The material in this subseries relates to the annual fairs of the American Institute. It consists of foldered items as well as bound volumes. The foldered material is organized chronologically. Generally, the same types of records (Vouchers, Judges Reports, and Reports of Managers, etc.) recur for each fair. The titles of the folders were assigned by the American Institute, and all material was kept in its original order. The material relates to the organizational preparations, financial data, and prize and entry information for the annual fairs. The bound volumes consist of Minute Books of various committees, Registers of Premiums, Entries, Judges, Invitations, and Tickets, and Account Books, Receipt Books, and Bank Books.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is little or no printed material regarding the fairs, and the correspondence relating to them is in the Administrative Subseries. The material in the Annual Fair Subseries contains the following main categories of information.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Business and Financial - The foldered material contains files entitled "Vouchers" for almost every year that a fair was held. The files consist of bills and receipts for payment by the American Institute to individuals and companies that provided services for the fair. The services include construction, concession stands, cleaning, and advertising. In some cases, vouchers pertaining to expenses incurred by specific committees are identified by the names of those committees. For instance, specific folders might be labeled as the vouchers of the Printing and Publication Committee or the Arrangement Committee. Some financial information, specifically, accounts of receipts and expenditures of any given year's fair can also be found within the foldered Reports of the Board of Managers and Finance Committees.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many bound volumes also contain financial information. There are numerous Account Books, Receipt Books, and Bank Books (see container list for details).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Reports and Minutes - The foldered material contains reports written by the various committees involved in the planning of the annual fairs. The reports and minutes of the Board of Managers detail the expenses and work of each individual committee. The nature of the reports of specific committees, such as the Ticket Committee, the Premium Committee, or the Finance Committee, is generally evident by the name of the committee.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bound volumes also contain information on the organizing committees. There are volumes of the Minutes of the Board of Managers for almost every year a fair was held. In addition to recording the minutes of the Board of Managers, the volumes contain lists of the members of each of the Fair's committees and record each committee's duties. The Minutes of the Board of Managers also detail the rules and regulations of the Fairs, payment of bills, and the votes on various motions. Minute books also exist for some of the committees for many of the fairs dated between 1840 and 1872. Some of the committees represented in these minute books are the Premium Committee, the Printing and Publication Committee, Committee of Arrangements, Finance Committee, Invitation Committee, Committee on Gas, Light, and Water, Floor Committee, Ticket Committee, Flag Committee, and the Committee on Audit.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Exhibit Entries - There is very little information pertaining expressly to entrants in fairs that were held prior to 1890, but between the years 1890 and 1897, entry forms appear for each exhibitor. These entry forms provide detailed information on exhibitors and their products or inventions. The entry forms list the exhibitors' name and address, the article submitted, the name of the inventor and/or manufacturer, and sometimes provide a description of the exhibit.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bound Registers of Entries list the name of the entrant, the product or invention being entered, and the entrant's designated number. The registers can be cross-referenced with the "Judges Reports" to locate comments on specific entries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Judges - In the foldered material, information on judging at the annual fair can be found within the "Judges' Reports." These reports are extensive and cover the vast array of exhibits for almost every year of the Annual Fair. The Judges' Reports are forms in which judges, chosen by the Institute for their expertise in a given field, evaluate exhibits and select prize winners. The reports list entries according to exhibit number and do not identify the name of the person or company exhibiting the product.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bound volumes also include Registers of Judges for various years between 1842 and 1892. These registers list the judges selected for each department or group category by year. Because the Premium Committee selected the judges for each Fair, the Minute Books of the Premium Committees also provide information on the judges chosen for that particular year.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Premiums - Not much information on premiums is found within the foldered material. Although the Judges' Reports identify the winners of the premiums, the Reports generally do not include lists of the winners. Similarly, the Premium Committee Reports often list a total number of premiums awarded but usually do not include names of specific winners. Only a small number of folders entitled "Medal Awards" that exist for certain years include receipts from winners of premiums for their awards.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bound volumes contain more material on the premiums awarded. The Registers of Premiums list the prizes awarded at each fair. They include the name of the premium winner, the winner's place of residence, the premium awarded, the category of the award, and sometimes, the winner's signature.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Fair Attendance - Information on fair attendance can be found in the Reports of the Ticket Committees. Most of the reports provide the total number of tickets sold, as well as tickets issued at no charge to members, schools, and guests. Some years also include daily totals of tickets sold. Additionally, the Reports of the Board of Managers often remark on the attendance for an annual fair. Although the reports do not always provide detailed numbers, they will often comment on the attendance of the fair in comparison to last year's figures.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bound Registers of Invitations list people invited to the Annual Fairs. The invitations generally included government officials, members of the press, clergymen, and other significant people within New York society. Also included is the bound Members' Ticket Register from 1897, which lists the number of tickets given to each member of the American Institute, and the Minutes of the Invitation Committee from 1850 to 1852.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some items of interest in the Annual Fair subseries include the listing of Samuel F. B. Morse as the winner of a gold medal in 1842 for his display of the telegraph. In 1871, Walt Whitman read a poem at the 40th Annual Fair. Within the material under "Reports and Papers" is a receipt signed by Walt Whitman acknowledging his payment of $157.84, the total representing his travel expenses and honorarium.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Researchers consulting information as it relates to specific annual fairs are encouraged to also consult any pertinent bound volumes (Subseries 3) for the corresponding time period.</field>
