    <field name="unittitle_teim">Sub-Subseries XIII.6.A - Photo Albums</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This sub-subseries contains 4 photo albums - 2 bound albums arranged chronologically (by Evert Jansen Wendell, ca. 1900-1910; and an album assembled by an unknown person at the CAS using photos by Lewis Hine, 1928), followed by 2 disbound albums arranged chronologically (probably by Louisa de Ferrari Weygandt or Lillian Weygandt ca. 1906, 1910 and undated; and by an unknown person or people at the CAS, ca. 1936-1944).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Two of these albums present a broad visual picture of the CAS: The Hine album contains a selection of some of the prints also collected in proof form in subseries XIII.2-4 above. The album documents the work of the CAS in various locations, with captions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 1936-1944 album/report is a photo essay which appears to be a draft, with original photographs attached to the pages by photocorners. The author(s) and photographer are unknown. It is unknown whether any final version of the report was ever produced. The entire volume was housed in a 3-ring binder. The section relating to Bowdoin Farm, placed at the back of the binder, was written in 1939, with 2 supplemental pages from 1944. The Bowdoin Farm pages have numerous editorial comments penciled or penned in. The other sections from the front of the binder (Centers, Newsboys, Convalescent Homes) appear to have been written in 1944 and perhaps constitute a later draft, as they have fewer editorial comments. The section on Convalescent Homes does not include photographs, but the other sections are richly illustrated with many 2.5"x 2.5" photographs, attached to the pages by photocorners. Some photographs are missing from the pages. There is no section on camps, but there are four loose photographs which may or may not have been intended for a section on that subject.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The other two photo albums were created by CAS-affiliated people, but the albums' relationship to the work of the CAS is unclear. The 1900-1910 photo album was assembled by Evert Jansen Wendell, a trustee of the CAS from 1902-1917 who is well represented throughout this collection by photographs and other material. His album consists of photographs from a trip to Cuba. It is probable that either Louisa de Ferrari Weygandt, Italian School principal from 1860-1921 or her daughter Lillian Weygandt, principal 1921-1930, is the creator of the 1906-1910 album, which was kept at their center until it was forwarded to the CAS archives at an unknown date. The photographs depict people in the country, possibly Venoge, NY.</field>
