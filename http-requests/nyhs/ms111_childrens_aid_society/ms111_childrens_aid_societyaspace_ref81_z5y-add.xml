    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists of 4 boxes of photographs and disbound photo albums, and 2 bound photo albums, divided into 4 sub-subseries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">XIII.3.A - Lewis Hine Prints of CAS Country Facilities - consists of prints by Lewis Hine of CAS country facilities, taken in 1928, arranged by print number. The photographs include a nearly complete set of 5x7 proofs numbered 1-84. Three numbers (45, 67, 79) are not represented, three additional numbers (5A, 31A, and 71A) are included, and there are a few duplicate proofs as well. The sub-subseries also includes 8x10 prints of many of these images. The images include many unpopulated landscapes, as well as images with people (especially farm school boys). The photographs were taken at a transitional time for the CAS, as the newly acquired Bowdoin Farm property in New Hamburg N.Y. was about to become a camp and farm school, replacing the Brace Farm School.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">XIII.3.B - Photographs of Farm Schools - contains photographs of the CAS farm training programs arranged chronologically with Brace Farm School first, followed by Bowdoin Farm School, and then unidentified Brace and/or Bowdoin Farm School. Within these divisions, folders are further subdivided by photographer, and arranged numerically by photograph number within the folders. The sub-subseries concludes with a set of 8 small format disbound photo albums entitled "Bowdoin Farm Boys" from 1935-1943, consisting of 549 2.75 x 4.5 portraits of young men who attended the farm school.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">XIII.3.C - Photographs of Camps - contains photographs of camp facilities, arranged alphabetically, and further subdivided chronologically. The Bowdoin Camp photographs include a bound photo album.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">XIII.3.D - Photographs of Convalescent Facilities - contains photographs of CAS convalescent facilities, arranged alphabetically by facility.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Researchers should note that two of the same facilities used for camps were also used for farm schools, and Goodhue camp was also used as a home for girls preparing to go to foster care. Thus, there is some overlap between the sub-subseries. Lewis Hines' photographs of mixed country facilities are arranged as sub-subseries A. Photographs of Goodhue Home are arranged with Goodhue Camp in sub-subseries C. For a partial history of facility name and location changes, please see the note for Series IX.2: Facilities-Alphabetical. For a history of convalescent facilities, please see the note for Series X.</field>
