    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children was founded in 1940 out of a desire to provide temporary foster homes for European refugee children during World War II. Eleanor Roosevelt was the Honorary President, Marshall Field was President, and Agnes King Inglis was Secretary of the organizataion. The Children's Aid Society was one agency authorized to investigate potential foster homes and provide follow-up supervision of the children placed in these homes. The Children's Aid Society was wary of the project. CAS Executive Director Arthur Huck believed the children would be better off in Europe and CAS President William Church Osborn noted that international transfer of children was a serious business. Ultimately, rather than sending the children to foster care, a group of British children was housed in the former home of Charles E. Mitchell in Tuxedo New York, under the care of Mrs. H.C. Sonne whose husband bought the house and provided funding to sustain the children. Contributions for what became known as The Children's House were sent to CAS and processed through CAS accounts. CAS then paid bills and salaries to support the endeavor.</field>
