    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries 1-5 contain prints and tintypes. Most prints are vintage, but there are some reprints. Most prints are unbound and individual, but there is also one photo album in subseries XIII.2, and one photo album and one set of disbound photo albums in subseries XIII.3.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries 6 includes 4 other photo albums with more wide-ranging subject matter. These include an album of Lewis Hine photographs of various CAS facilities and programs(individual prints of the same photographs and others by Lewis Hine are also arranged by facility in Subseries 2-4), and an interesting photo-essay about the CAS, composed ca. 1939 and 1944, consisting of a typed narrative about CAS programs and history illustrated by small sharp photographs attached by photocorners. See the subseries description for more information about this item and the other 2 photo albums in the subseries. Subseries 6 also includes oversize photographs and photographs that were neither commissioned by the CAS nor depicting the CAS, but which were kept by the CAS.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Emigration Department company photographs (group portraits of children who traveled together) and other photographs in Subseries XIII.5 include the earliest photographs in the collection. This subseries contains prints and tintypes ca. 1890-1930's. In addition to these photographs, a complete list of Emigration Department case files containing thousands more prints, tintypes and postcards 1890's-1980's may be obtained from the reference department of the library at the New-York Historical Society. The photographers are unknown for all of the company photographs and most of the case file photographs. However, almost every tintype in the collection was taken by a single photographer named O'Connor, who worked from his studio on Eighth Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets. The tintypes most often depict adolescent boys and young men before they traveled to the country. Most of the tinytpes are individual portraits, some are group portraits of two or three boys, and a few tintypes include Trustee Evert Jansen Wendell with the boy.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the photographs in the other subseries date from the 1910's through the early 1930's. These photographs were taken for public relations purposes, by photographers hired by the Children's Aid Society. The principal photographers represented in the collection are Underwood &amp; Underwood (ca. 1908-1913), Brown &amp; Dawson (a.k.a. Publisher's Photo Service) (ca. 1913-1926), A. Tennyson Beals (ca. 1915-1927), Hiram Myers (ca. 1923-1926), Paul Parker (ca. 1926-1932), and Lewis Hine (1928).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most dates are approximate. Most photographs in this collection were never reprinted in documents in this collection, and those images that were reproduced in annual reports or other publications were often reproduced many years after the photographs were taken, making dating difficult. Conversely, most early photomechanical reproductions in the annual reports have no corresponding print in this collection; the originals have been lost. In addition, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty which facility is depicted in a photograph. Every effort has been made to accurately identify facilities and ascertain approximate dates, based on cross-referencing photographs in CAS publications, using identification numbers and visual clues on the photographs, and mining the institutional memory of the CAS as researched by Victor Remer and the processing archivist, but misidentifications remain possible.</field>
