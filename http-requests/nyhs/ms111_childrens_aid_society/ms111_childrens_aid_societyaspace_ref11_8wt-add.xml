    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains the records of CAS programs which placed children in homes with non-relatives, whether for adoption, foster care, or employment. This arrangement follows the CAS' own arrangment -- the CAS kept adoption, foster care, and employment case files together. The names of CAS placement programs changed over time, but the Children's Aid Society kept the records continuously through name changes, using the consecutive record books and case files collected in this series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series is subdivided into 6 subseries. Most of the material in subseries 3-5 is restricted.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries XI.1 - Broadsides, Pamphlets, Reports, and Other Materials circa 1867-circa 1994 consists of one box of Emigration, Placing-Out, and Foster Care materials arranged chronologically.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries XI.2 - Correspondence from Children and Foster Families, Chronological, 1855-1914 (bulk 1861-1881)consists of 10 boxes of correspondence, arranged chronologically. This subseries is open for researchers. There is a 13 year gap between the bulk of the final material in the subseries and the first material of the following subseries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries XI.3 - Case Files 1895-1951 (bulk 1895-1939) consists of circa 15,000 case files in 913 boxes. This subseries is the largest part of the CAS collection. The case files are comprised of foster care and adoption records, and perhaps an equal number of records of employment placements -- records of boys who trained at the Farm School and were subsequently placed in farm homes for wages. The case files include forms, reports on frequent CAS follow-up visits, photographs, and correspondence from the placed-out children, their host families, and occasionally their biological families. Many children kept up correspondence with agents of the CAS well into adulthood. The names of individual children have not been included in this finding aid, because the information is restricted.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries XI.4 - Bound Volumes consists of 100 bound volumes of records of the Emigration and Placing-Out Program (1853-1916). These volumes include Surrender Volumes, in which guardians surrender their charges to the care of the Children's Aid Society; Record Books, which describe individual cases; Company Books, listing groups that traveled together; and other volumes</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries XI.5 contains disbound ring binders and lists created by the Foster Home Department, 1917-1939 (bulk 1929-1939).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries XI.6 consists of non-CAS publications related to the "Orphan Train," including self-published books by orphan train riders.</field>

      History of CAS Emigration Programs, including "Family Emigration," Employment, Adoption, and Foster Care
    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The mission of sending children to the country was the driving force of the Children's Aid Society from its founding in 1853. Twenty-five years later, in the 26th annual report from 1878, the society continued to affirm that "the most important part of our work is the transference of poor and homeless children to good country homes." The primacy of that mission continued throughout the period covered by this collection. The Emigration Department sent thousands of children to foster care and(for older children)employment situations in the country. In some cases, children were formally adopted by families, or families later chose to adopt them, but in most cases children were placed less formally.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The CAS called the program Emigration in its annual reports beginning circa 1859, and it was known as the Emigration and/or Placing-Out Department until 1899. From 1899-1925 it was known in the annual reports as the "Western Emigration and Placing-Out Department," although the CAS continued to use forms which called it alternately the Emigration or Placing-Out Department.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">It is well known that the CAS separated children from their families to start anew. It is less widely known that the CAS also provided train tickets for entire families to leave the city together, to rejoin a breadwinner or pursue other opportunities. Beginning in 1874, the CAS initiated an explicit "family emigration" program which signalled a shift toward a goal of keeping families together. Beginning around 1898 the department's stated purpose in the annual reports included not only "finding homes for homeless chldren" but also "assisting poor families to reach distant friends for employment." Families traveled on the same trains as companies of children and are included in the "Company Books" and the "Record Books" in subseries XI.4. However, families were never included in the case files of the Emigration Department; the CAS did not provide additional social work care for them or track their progress. Although some information about families is contained in Emigration Department Record Books, other records of Family Emigration were kept separate, in volumes that are arranged in the following series of this collection, as Series XII.2.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Beginning around 1923 a Family Home Department was initiated, to put children in temporary suburban homes with the goal of eventually returning them to their families. In 1926 this Family Home Department became known as the Boarding Home Department, and the Western Emigration and Placing-Out Department became known as the Home-Finding or Placing-Out Department, and sometimes the Free Home and Adoption Department. In 1931 these two programs, the Home-Finding Department and the Boarding Home Department, were consolidated as the Department of Foster Home Care, aka the Foster Home Department. The Foster Home Department had two divisions: the Free Home Division, for older boys, adolescent girls, and troubled youths, and the Boarding Division, for younger children. </field>
