    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Personal papers and ephemera are included in this series. Of particular note is the wedding book of George Williams Seaman and Irmingarde Van Horne Freeman Seaman in which many of the family members are mentioned (Box 6, Folder 6). The folder also contains wedding invitations and several associated photographs. A portion of the estate inventory of George and Irmingarde (Box 6, Folder 7) is annotated to indicate from whom items were inherited or purchased. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In Folder 8 are a number of items that are not clearly associated with a specific member of the Van Horn, Freeman, DeWindt or Seaman families. Items include letters; receipts; notes on scraps of paper; an advertisement for "Dr. Wistar's Balsom of Wild Cherry" (1844); extracts from a memorial for John Dubois (1869); pages from a notebook concerning medical expenses (1880-1881); a copy of a document promising freedom to two slaves if they obey their master for ten years (1805); and an undated sermon discussing Acts II Verse 23.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Three volumes are included in the series - a notebook that appears to have belonged to Ida Van Horn Freeman and two scrapbooks belonging to Caroline Elizabeth DeWindt Monell. One scrapbook contains miscellaneous clippings and personal writings and the other includes, primarily, clippings describing Newburgh's Centennial (1882) celebrating the 100th anniversary of the end of the American Revolution. Caroline Monell's second husband, Judge John J. Monell, was on the Centennial's Executive Committee and made a speech during the festivities. The scrapbook also contains a drawing and other items unrelated to the Centennial. The smaller two volumes are housed in boxes (*).</field>
