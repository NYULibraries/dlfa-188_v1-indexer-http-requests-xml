    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of the more than 105 letters in this series, fifty-three are those of John B. Seaman and the majority of his correspondence is with Charles C. Peck, his business partner or agent. These letters deal primarily with business transactions. There are quite a number of condolence letters to John B. Seaman and his niece, Lizzie, on the death of his wife Amelia. There are other letters of a personal nature as well. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A number of family members moved to Texas and several of the letters are from Bonham County where John B. Seaman and C.C. Peck sold land to a Howard L. Parmele for the establishment of a settlement. Of interest is a letter from John Seaman's nephew, Seaman Field, describing the 'new city' of Dallas and commenting on his suspicion and dislike for members of the Parmele family (Box 2, Folder 2 - March 15, 1874).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Another letter of particular note was written to Emily Seaman on September 16, 1900, from "Lizzie" in Galveston, Texas (Box 2, Folder 4). The letter describes the devastating hurricane that killed thousands and destroyed much of the city. The letter is not in good condition, but it is legible.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In Box 2, Folder 6, there is what appears to be a copy of a letter sent on November 5, 1815, from John Adams, the former U.S. President, to John P. DeWindt congratulating him on the birth of a daughter. The daughter, Caroline, was born on Adams' birthday.</field>
