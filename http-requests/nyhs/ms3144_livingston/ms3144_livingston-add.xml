    <field name="bioghist_teim">James Duane Livingston III (1930–2019) assembled this collection of family papers, photographs, and genealogical research to preserve for his daughters the biographical details of his own life, and of the lives of their shared ancestors and collateral relatives. On his father's side Livingston descended from Robert Livingston (1654–1728), his six-times great-grandfather, first lord of Livingston Manor, a 160,000-acre patent on the Hudson River. The Livingston family counted such notables as Robert R. Livingston (1746–1813), a member of the Committee of Five who drafted the Declaration of Independence, and Philip Livingston (1714–1778), who signed it. William Livingston (1723–1790) signed the U.S. Constitution, and Robert R. Livingston administered the oath of office to George Washington when he assumed the presidency in 1789. James Duane Livingston (1786–1837), a great-great grandson of the first lord of Livingston Manor, was the first to bear that combination of names. They would repeat in his grandson, James Duane Livingston (1859–1936), great-grandson, James Duane Livingston Jr. (1890–1956), and great-great-grandson, James Duane Livingston III, the compiler. (The suffixes "Jr." and "III" are not observed consistently on documents in the collection.)</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">James Duane Livingston Jr., a native of Indianapolis, married Florence Josephine Boullee (1892–1983), a native of New Jersey, in 1924 in New York City. Together they operated a printing concern on Wall Street. Florence descended from Wilhelm Heinrich Boullee (1821–1882), a country doctor, and his wife, Augusta E. Engelhardt (1827–1898), German immigrants who settled in New Hamburg, Ontario, Canada, in the 1840s, and from Friedrich Jugneit (1837–1901), a Prussian immigrant who served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and his wife, Maria Schmidling (1846– ).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Together James Duane and Florence (Boullee) Livingston had one child, a son, James Duane Livingston III, who was born in Brooklyn. James was a graduate of Midwood High School who went on to Cornell and Harvard Universities and spent thirty-three years as a research physicist for General Electric in Schenectady, New York. He married twice, first (1953) to Nancy Lee Clark, by whom he had three daughters (Joan, Susan, and Barbara Livingston), and second (1985) to Sherry (Hood) Penney (1937–2019).</field>
