    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Harry T. Peters Collection of Pictorial Newspaper Illustrations spans the period from circa 1845 to 1920 and contains approximately 10,500 wood engravings depicting daily life and news events of the late 19th century. The collection is organized into two series: general subjects and places/geographical views.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The vast majority of the illustrations in the collection are black and white wood engravings, but a few earlier woodcuts and some later halftone prints are also included. Most of the collection's single and double-page sheets are from the leading American pictorial journals: Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper (1855-1922) and Harper's Weekly (1857-1916). Other publications include Gleason's Pictorial Drawing Room Companion (begun in 1851, from 1855-1859 was known as Ballou's Pictorial), the New York Illustrated News, and Scientific American (begun in 1845). Some earlier (1840s-50s) views are cut from the Illustrated London News (begun in 1842). Many images are full sheets, so that the publication and date are clearly visible; some images have been cut so that no identifying information can be found.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Images show aspects of daily life, important news and cultural events, and fanciful illustrations on a wide variety of topics. In many cases, images found in this collection are difficult to find elsewhere, as photography was not fully in use as a documentary format, and as the ephemeral nature of many of the events pictured did not warrant a separately-issued lithograph or engraving. While images pertaining to a certain geographic region have been grouped together, the researcher is encouraged to look through the "subject" folders as well as through geographic views, as one is likely to find additional images in both places. There appears to be substantial overlap between some of the categories. Subject categories were created by N-YHS staff after the donation of the collection, and have not been changed.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Numerous artists are represented, and the work of several leading illustrators has been grouped together. These are William M. Cary, Arthur B. Frost, Winslow Homer, Thomas Nast, Howard Pyle, and Frederic Remington.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I. General subjects includes clippings sorted by general subject. The largest categories are entertainment, sports, ships, and politics. Engravings sorted by artist can be found in this series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II. Places holds clippings sorted by location. The majority of these deal with New York City, particularly its buildings and events. Beyond the New York metropolitan region, large sections include images of Philadelphia, Chicago, and international locations.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Harry Twyford Peters was a coal merchant, sportsman, and pioneer in collecting and writing in the field of American lithography. Peters was born in 1881 in Greenwich, Connecticut. He graduated from Columbia College in 1903, and then joined his father's profitable coal business, Williams &amp; Peters. He remained at the firm until his retirement in 1945.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Collecting as an activity was well-known to a young Harry Peters. His father Samuel Twyford Peters was a collector of Chinese ceramics. His uncle Henry O. Havemeyer was a noted collector of French paintings. Havemeyer is said to have encouraged Peters to collect American prints, as they were not frequently collected at the beginning of the 20th century. Peters, an avid sportsman, was later said to have begun his collection of Currier &amp; Ives prints after seeing one of their prints of the famous horse Lady Suffolk. He began to collect sporting prints, and later expanded his interest to the entire oeuvre of the firm. He later collected work by other American lithographing firms as well.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Peters eventually published several books on American prints and printmakers, and his work is generally credited for reviving interest in the lithographic work of the firm Currier &amp; Ives. His 2 volume "Currier &amp; Ives, Printmakers to the American People," was published in 1929 and 1931. "America on Stone," a more general history of lithography, also came out in 1931, and was followed in 1935 by "California on Stone," which included an iconography of the Gold Rush and California. In 1942 a one-volume edition of the Currier &amp; Ives set was published, which became a bestseller and was included in the Book-of-the-Month Club.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Peters became a member of N-YHS in 1930, and a Fellow in 1946. In 1947 he was awarded the New-York Historical Society's 5th Gold Medal for Achievement in History for his outstanding contributions to the history of graphic arts and social history. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Peters exhibited show dogs and horses throughout his life, and frequently served as a judge at Westminster Kennel Club shows. He served as Master of the Meadow Brook Hounds for twenty-three years. Harry Peters died on June 1, 1948.</field>
