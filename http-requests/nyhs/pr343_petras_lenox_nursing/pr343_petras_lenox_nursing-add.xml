    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1) A copy of Achelis, the Lenox Hill Hospital School of Nursing yearbook, for the year 1945. This was May Petras's copy, and includes an image of her. Several of her fellow graduates inscribed messages to her in the book. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2) A toned gelatin silver photograph of sculptor Walter Russell (1871-1963). The photo is inscribed with regards by Russell to Petras, and dated 30 July 1943. A note on the reverse of the photograph indicates that Russell was a patient of Petras. The photograph was taken in Russell's studio in the Carnegie Hall apartments (the central portion of which was later occupied by Editta Sherman, according to N-YHS curator Marilyn Kushner); he is pictured working on a large bust of Franklin D. Roosevelt.</field>
