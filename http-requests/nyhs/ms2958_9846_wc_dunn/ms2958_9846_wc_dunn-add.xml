    <field name="abstract_teim">W.C. Dunn writes from the "quarantine ground" (i.e., Staten Island) in New York to Wakefield Smith, a druggist in Boston, addressing him as "Friend Smith." Dunn is "destitute to a single cent" and asks Smith to inquire at the Union Bank to determine how much money Dunn has, but in any case to send eighty or ninety dollars to him. Dunn recounts that he had sailed to Savannah with lumber for the Jamaica market, but the vessel was seized and he had "lost the whole of his adventure." He was now stopped in quarantine for 20 or 30 days with a shipment of cotton from Mobile. In addition to financial stress, he is unwell with exhaustion from the "intense heat." Dunn asks that the money be directed to the owner of the vessel, a commission merchant named Chandler(?). The folder also includes an envelope that was apparently used to hold the letter at some point, but is unrelated to the original use; the envelope is postmarked 1900 and was mailed from San Francisco to Rutland, Vermont.
