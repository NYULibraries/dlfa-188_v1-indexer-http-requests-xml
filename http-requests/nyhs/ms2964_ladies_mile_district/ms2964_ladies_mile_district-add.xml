    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection was acquired from the New York Preservation Archives Project (NYPAP), a non-profit dedicated to archiving the historic preservation movement in New York. While it is not a repository itself, NYPAP works to funnel material relevant to the preservation movement to appropriate archives. As a result, this collection pertains to the 20th century effort to preserve the Ladies' Mile, rather than the history of the buildings themselves.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">It contains a cross-section of the research done and the campaigns organized by the Drive to Protect Ladies' Mile. There are hundreds of letters of support from New Yorkers living both within and outside the proposed district, as well as letters from former New Yorkers, and preservation enthusiasts. The Drive to Protect Ladies' Mile also asked for and received support from representatives for New York institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Conde Nast Publishing. There are press clippings spanning decades, tracking the progress of the Drive, as well as the opposition from a few Real Estate groups. There is a large amount of research done in support of the designation, including bound volumes of that work which were presented to the Landmarks Commission. This also includes swaths of statistics relating to the buildings themselves. Relatedly, there is a copy of Margaret and Truman Moore's book End of the Road for Ladies' Mile? as well as an unbound manuscript, many of Truman's photographs, and the slides from the traveling lecture they created to raise awareness. The Drive also put together an archive to pass along to NYPAP. This contains press and letters of support held in binders, as well a couple artifacts discovered in the course of their research; a set of Siegel-Cooper playing cards, and the 1896 guidebook Bird's Eye View of New York and its Most Magnificent Store. Lastly, there is a small amount of administrative material concerning the Drive's budget, steering committee and interpersonal correspondence. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Drive to Protect the Ladies' Mile Historic District was a community organization created in an effort to preserve the area of midtown known as the Ladies' Mile. Roughly defined, the Ladies' Mile spans the area from the East blocks of Broadway, to the west side of Sixth Avenue, 23rd to 14th street, including parts of Union Square, and a few blocks of Broadway down to 9th street. It contains approximately 400 buildings. Called the Ladies' Mile because of the variety of department stores, clubs and restaurants that drew wealthy New York women to the area during the Gilded Age, the area includes the Flatiron Building, the Siegel-Cooper Building and many more. Most date to the late 19th century. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The effort to have the area designated a historic district began in the early 1980's with Truman and Margaret Moore, a photographer and preservationist respectively. The couple took notice of the declining condition of many of the old department stores and combined their efforts to create a slideshow and lecture which highlighted the neighborhood's unique architecture and historic value. That slideshow eventually became a book, and along with Anthony C. Wood and Christabel Gough, the Moores organized the Drive to Protect Ladies' Mile. Preservation advocate Jack Taylor joined in 1984 and spearheaded the effort as its president. It became an umbrella organization for a number of other preservation-minded groups, all focused on the midtown area. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the area a historic district in 1989.</field>
