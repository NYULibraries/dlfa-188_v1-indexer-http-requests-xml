    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I. Correspondence, 1916-1942</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is arranged chronologically and includes incoming, copies of outgoing, and internal ADS correspondence (among board members, officers, and members). Also included are letters to and from Charles Stewart Davison that do not deal directly with ADS.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In general, attachments were kept with their respective correspondence. However, original ADS organizational material attached to letters, such as meeting minutes, resolutions, and financial reports, was removed to Series II, and a preservation photocopy was filed in its place. Newspaper clippings were also copied, and removed to Series IV.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Letters from 1916 to 1917 deal with World War I, ADS meetings and internal society matters, and politics. There are also numerous responses to ADS's "ten proposals" from business leagues, leaders, retail associations and chambers of commerce around the country.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Topics in correspondence from 1918 include the case of Thomas Mooney (the labor activist accused of bombing a patriotic march), the I.W.W., 'subversive' meetings, conditions in the U.S. Army (sickness, pay), William Randolph Hearst (his disloyalty), the ADS campaign/boycott against German goods and the teaching of German in schools, German atrocities, the impending post-war settlement with Germany ("unconditional surrender"), the situation in Russia, sedition and disloyalty, and immigration restriction. Internal correspondence discusses ADS proposals and operational matters including events, aims, salaries, campaigns, finances, and the women's committee. Also included are correspondence from the DC bureau of ADS, correspondence with artist Edwin Howland Blashfield regarding his stamp design for the society, and letters from members of congress. One set of correspondence with the Auburn Bureau, filed together in a report, deals with an ADS editorial and a threat of libel suit.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Topics from 1919 include the post-war future of ADS, the death of Theodore Roosevelt, the Citizens Committee of Welcome for U.S. soldiers, immigration restriction, labor, socialism, Bolshevism, and William Randolph Hearst.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1920 correspondence discusses the future of ADS and its financial troubles, Bolshevism, subversive behavior, immigration, labor strikes, the situation in Ireland, internal ADS matters such as meetings, finances, and campaigns i.e. Roosevelt portraits, lawsuits, the distribution of "Protocols and World Revolution," and personal matters of staff members. Numerous letters from members concern the 1920 presidential election and the society's support of candidate Warren G. Harding.</field>

Immigration restriction is a prominent topic of discussion from 1923-1928. Letters also deal with internal ADS matters including the street speaking campaign, the society's debt and financial difficulties, and libel suits against ADS.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence from 1929 to 1934 concerns ADS debt and finances, distribution of anti-communist pamphlets, the Socialist party, and Davison's legal matters.</field>

Much of the material for these years is Charles Stewart Davison's letters to editors and senators about world politics or correspondence of Davison that does not deal directly with ADS.</field>
