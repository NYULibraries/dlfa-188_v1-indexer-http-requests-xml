    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains material that documents the daily operations of ADS including board and committee meeting minutes, schedules, programs, and notices; resolutions, proposals, editorials, press releases (often multiple drafts of); committee member and candidate lists; reports from outside sources on various topics; "operators reports" (purportedly inside information on subversive activities, personages and meetings); legal material; financial material (statements, receipts, reports); notes; memos; phone messages; calling and business cards, addresses, and photographs. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Organizational material is arranged chronologically. Financial material, phone message slips, calling and business cards, and address slips are filed separately. Attachments were kept with material, usually memorandums; newspaper clippings were photocopied and moved to Series IV.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included in this series are three photographs of a woman, presumably an ADS Women's Committee member, soliciting signatures on a petition against the German press ([1918]). An additional photograph depicts what appears to be a mural of FDR and other individuals from the 1930s.</field>
