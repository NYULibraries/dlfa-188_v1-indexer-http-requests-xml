    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes the paper-based records of the Victorian Society in America, Metropolitan Chapter (VSNY), with some early records of the parent organization. Overall, the VSNY records include newsletters, Board minutes and other governance matters, financial records, event publicity, membership forms, and other material ranging from the 1970s to 2019. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files retain VSNY's original chronological order and the coding structure used by VSNY to arrange each year's documents by subject matter. These codes (i.e, letters A to X) were used consistently to sequence the folders for newsletters, minutes, and so forth for each year. Following is a description of the content for the letter codes used by VSNY for the records. However, not all documents/codes are present in every year.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Folder Code A) Metropolitan Chapter Newsletters
VSNY began publishing a Chapter newsletter in 1983. The newsletter is published twice a year, in the spring and fall, with occasional additional issues and/or a Chapter update leaflets. The newsletter contains news and updates on VSNY's preservation advocacy; VSNY awards, scholarships, and grants; VSA Summer Schools; Board news and interviews, member news and lists; past events; and comprehensive calendar of all lectures, seminars, and tours; among other recurring features. 
Folders contain as many extant copies as were delivered by VSNY and some issues are missing. 
Before 1983 news from the VSA Chapters was contained within the VSA's national publication, The Victorian; see Folder Code J) National Publications. 
See also:
– Series II, Digital, may contain draft articles and photos submitted to the newsletter and some PDFs of printed issues
– Issues from 2007-present are available at https://vicsocny.org</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Folder Code B) Board Minutes
Contains extant monthly Board meeting agendas, minutes and, possibly, some correspondence outside of Board meetings that affect agenda items. 
The VSNY Board begins its term on July 1, annually, and ends on June 30. From July to September VSNY Committees meet to plan the next year and the monthly board meetings begin in September. In earlier years, Board terms of service were limited to one year and, eventually, VSNY adopted longer, multi-year terms. 
Of note, some VSNY Board Members, such as William (Bill) J. Dane, served on VSA national's board and committees, and VSNY correspondence may sometimes be commingled with national business (Folder Code K).
