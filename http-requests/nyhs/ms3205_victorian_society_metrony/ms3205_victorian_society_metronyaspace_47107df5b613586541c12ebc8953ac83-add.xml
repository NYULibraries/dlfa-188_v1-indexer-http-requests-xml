    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of digital files transferred from several CDs and one 3.5-inch floppy disk in the collection. These digital records consist primarily of routine business matters such as meeting minutes, financial reports, membership management, preservation advocacy efforts, newsletters, and annual meeting presentations. Scans of some early (1960s-70s) historical documents related to the organization are here, accounting for the pre-digital year in the series' date range. Also included here are the files from a set of 3 CDs of a 2010 oral history interview of William (Bill) J. Dane. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The container list documents each of the individual CDs/floppy from which files were preserved, with a summary of their content. The title used in the container list for the media was established by the processing archivist because of the ambiguity of the original media's inscription, which is also recorded in the container list's description. A full manifest of the individual files comprising the series is available from the reference librarian upon request.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Digital files were not retrieved from damaged, duplicate, and commercially available CDs or due to disk formatting issues, though the physical media itself remains in the collection. Some of the preserved files may not be accessible due to file and/or media corruption and/or because the library does not have the proprietary software necessary to make the information they contain accessible. </field>
