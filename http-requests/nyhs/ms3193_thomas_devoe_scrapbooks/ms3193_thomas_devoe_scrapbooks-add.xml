    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes 80 scrapbooks compiled by Thomas De Voe. The bulk of the content is newspaper clippings, though some other printed forms are present as well. Some material ranges as early as circa 1720 and as late as 1890, but the bulk ranges from the 1850s into the 1880s. A few of the volumes are indexes to scrapbooks of clippings, which may or may not be in this collection. Entries in the container list that begin with the word Index indicate these.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">34 of the volumes concern either New York City history (that is, from De Voe's perspective looking back from the mid-19th century) or contemporary developments during the 1850s to 1880s. These latter volumes include a variety of subject matter about the development of New York (especially Manhattan), such as in transportation (ferries, railways, etc.), cultural institutions (museums, historical societies), infrastructure (streets), events, etc. 15 volumes relate to obituaries or other profiles of notable people, 8 relate to the Civil War and other military matters, 7 concern markets, and the remaining 16 volumes are on various topics.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each volume is listed in the container list. Volumes that retain a title given them by De Voe are noted in "quotations." Volumes that have a title given them over time by someone at N-YHS (possibly taken from a now missing original De Voe label) are noted in [brackets]. Volumes listed with no such markings were titled by the processing archivist in 2022 for the inventory; in these cases the volume had no indication of a title and the archivist assigned one based on a skim of the content.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Thomas F. De Voe was born in 1811 in Westchester County, New York. He apprenticed as a butcher, then operated his own business at the Jefferson Market at 6th Avenue and Christopher Street in Manhattan from 1833 to 1872. In 1840, his fellow Jefferson Market butchers chose De Voe to represent them to the city on regulatory matters. To do this work more effectively, De Voe did research, including at New-York Historical Society, where he eventually became a member. With the encouragement of N-YHS Librarian George Moore and others, De Voe turned his research into the published works he is well-known for: "The Market Book" (1862), a historical account of New York's markets, and "The Market Assistant" (1867), a description of the foods available at the markets. De Voe was also an officer of the New York State militia's 8th Regiment. In 1872, De Voe gave up his business to become New York City's Superintendent of Markets. He died in 1892.</field>
