    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes 22 photographs taken by photojournalist and anthropologist Teun Voeten.

All of the photos are black-and-white, and all but three are captioned on the back. 3 photos are 16 x 12 inches; 19 are 11-1/2 x 8-1/4 inches or slightly smaller.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Teun Voeten was born in 1961 in the Netherlands. He studied cultural anthropology and philosophy at Leiden University, while also developing an increasing interest in photography. He gained experience as a photographer in the Netherlands and in New York, where he attended the School of Visual Arts in 1989. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In New York, Voeten went to work for the photo agency Impact Visuals, covering stories such as the social justice protests in Bensonhurst, New York, following the murder of Yusuf Hawkins (1989) and the Nicaraguan elections (1990). He earned his master's degree in anthropology in 1991 and continued working as a photojournalist, often in conflict zones around the world.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1994, Voeten wrote an article about a community of 30 or so people, commonly considered to be "homeless," who resided in the railroad tunnels of Amtrak under Manhattan's Riverside Park. Following up on this initial article, Voeten lived with these so-called "tunnel people" for 5 months in 1994-95, documenting and photographing their lives. This led to the publication in 1996 of his book, in Dutch, "Tunnelmensen." The book was revised and translated into English as "Tunnel People," published in 2010.</field>
