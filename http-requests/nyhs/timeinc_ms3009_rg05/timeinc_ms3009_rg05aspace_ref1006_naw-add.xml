    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Henry Luce III files date during his tenure as Time publisher and vice president of corporate planning. Subject files from his role as publisher are in the Time Inc. Time Publishing and Business Records (MS 3009-RG 24). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">General Correspondence is primarily business social letters to and from executives at other companies, heads of state, and other prominent people in business regarding social or business events, charitable development activities for other organizations, speeches, personal references, and some discussion of Luce's family. It isn't clear if this correspondence is directly related to his position. As the date range for the correspondence concludes while he was VP, the records are included here. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The St. Bernard's School files are materials received by Luce during his time as a member of its Board of Trustees. The files are included here as they are external activities of a member of corporate management.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Henry "Hank" Luce III was the son of Time Inc. co-founder Henry R. Luce and was on staff at Time Inc. from 1951 to 1980. Aside from his work at Time Inc., Luce was also the president and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Luce joined Time Inc. in 1951 as a correspondent. From 1956 to 1960 he was the head of the New Building Department, planning and overseeing the construction of the Time &amp; Life Building at Rockefeller Center. Once the new building opened, Luce held positions in the publisher's offices of Time and Fortune before becoming Fortune Circulation Director in 1961. At this time St. Bernard's School also elected him as its president. It isn't clear how long he held this position although he was a board member of the school for several years before and after. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1964 Luce joined Time Inc. corporate management as the associate director of research and development. From 1966 through 1968 he held positions as the Time-Life News Service London bureau chief and as publisher of Fortune. From 1969 to 1972, Luce served as Time publisher.
