    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of Gerald Levin's files date from his role as executive vice president (EVP) of strategy and development at the corporate level and vice chairman of Time Inc. overseeing strategy. His files were stored in the Time Inc. Archives as "corporate strategy" and include a mix of files from his time as HBO chairman, group vice president of video, EVP of strategy, and vice chairman of Time Inc. through the Time Inc. and Warner Communications merger. As they were found in the archives intermingled, they remain that way. The majority of Levin's files from his earlier roles with Video Group are in the Time Inc. Video Group Records (MS 3009-RG 41).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Administrative Files and Confidential Files of Levin's records document his work on defining the corporate mission; company restructuring; possible partnerships or ventures with other companies, including internationally; and his work on the Time Inc. and Warner communications merger. Records include correspondence with other companies; interoffice memoranda; presentations to the Board; notes on meetings for the Board, analysts, the Time Inc. annual meeting, and various conferences and company retreats; budgets; research on media industries; and transcripts and background information of speeches.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series Confidential Files retains the name the files had while in the Time Inc. Archives storage, but does not indicate restrictions. While there is no material difference from the Administrative Files, the Confidential Files remain in a separate series to document the division his office made during the transfer. Confidential Files are Levin's files on Time Inc.'s mergers and considered mergers with other companies, mainly the Time Warner merger. Some documents and original folder titles used code names for various companies such as "Gulf" for Gannett, "Tango" for Time Inc., and "Wonder" for Warner Communications. The use of "Gulf" for Gannett does not appear to have any relation to his files reviewing the possible acquisition of Gulf and Western Industries. Materials found inside the file titled "ABC-CBS" include notes on discussions with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gerald "Jerry" Levin joined Time Inc. in 1972 as vice president of programming for Home Box Office (HBO) while the new subsidiary was still in development. He became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of HBO in March 1973 and then chairman of HBO in May 1976. In August of 1979, Time Inc. appointed Levin as the group vice president of video, overseeing Time-Life Films and HBO along with other cable operations and interests including American Television and Communications Corporation (ATC). In March 1984 Levin was named an executive vice president of Time Inc. making him the chief strategist. In July 1988 the Time Inc. board of directors elected him as a member and named him vice chairman of Time Inc. In this role Levin pursued alternative strategies for all areas of the company. During his time as vice chairman, he was one of the executives managing the merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications, Inc. that created Time Warner. After the merger, he retained his vice chairman title. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In January 1991, the board elected him as chairman of Time Warner. A few months later, the board named him chief operating officer handling media and entertainment business operations. In February 1992 Levin joined Steven J. Ross as co-CEO of Time Warner and replaced N. J. Nicholas, Jr. as president. Upon Ross's death in December of that year, Levin became the sole CEO. AT that time he reorganized the board to have fewer "insiders" or those employed by Time Warner as well as decreasing the overall number of members. By January 1993, the board elected Levin as chairman; he retained his titles as CEO and president. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Under Levin's leadership, Time Warner and America Online (AOL) announced a merger (which was really an acquisition of Time Warner by AOL) in early 2000. The deal was made right before the internet stock bubble burst. This ended up being a difficult merger resulting in falling stock value and extensive cost cutting the new AOL Time Warner company. By October 2003, the company returned to its former name of Time Warner. Levin announced his retirement from Time Warner in December 2001 and left the company in May 2002.</field>
