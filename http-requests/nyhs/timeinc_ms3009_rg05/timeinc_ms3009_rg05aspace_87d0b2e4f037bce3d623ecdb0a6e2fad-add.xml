    <field name="scopecontent_teim">William Rukeyser's files document his work researching publishing Time Inc. magazines or new magazines in the international market. His research includes the issue if articles from the original Time Inc. magazies could be directly translated or if additional editing and rewriting was required. Rukeyser explored partnerships with publishers outside of the United States such as Gruner + Jahr and Singapore Press Holdings Ltd Group. He also received a proposal from Sinolink Group for a Chinese edition of Time magazine. Rukeyser also researched other types of media markets including television and VCR use. Time Inc. contracted consultant Lee B. Hall for this project, and Rukeyser's files include extensive correspondence with opinions and research reports from Hall.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rukeyser's role at the corporate management level overlapped in function with the Time Inc. International department although he was not part of this department. Further records on Time Inc.'s international publishing ventures are in Time Inc. International Records (MS 3009-RG 56).</field>
