    <field name="scopecontent_teim">James A. Linen's files document his tenure as president, chairman of the board, and chairman of the executive committee. The records contain two decades of his appointment books, detailed information on his speeches, and document Time Inc.'s participation in establishing the Prince of Songkhla University in Thailand with the project led by the Office of the President. His appointment books and speeches were sent to the Time Inc. Archives as complete runs without separation by title held so his files span from his time as Time publisher through his retirement.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">James A. Linen joined Time Inc. in 1934 as part of Time's editorial staff. After holding advertising positions for Time and Life, he was named publisher of Time in 1945.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1960, during a major realignment of Time Inc., the board named him president of Time Inc. at the same time they appointed Andrew Heiskell as chairman of the board. Linen stepped down from this position in 1969 due to illness. At that time, he was named the executive committee chairman holding this position until at least 1975. According to his obituary by the Associate Press, Linen retired from Time Inc. in 1977. He remained listed as a board member through January 1978.</field>
