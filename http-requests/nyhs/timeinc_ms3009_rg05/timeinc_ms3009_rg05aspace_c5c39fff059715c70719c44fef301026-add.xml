    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Vice President of Administration Rosemarie Di Sapio files include her records as vice president and director of this office. Records include memoranda and documents from corporate offices regarding expenses and staff movement; files regarding the expenses related to meetings and conferences; and records regarding overhauls in staffing numbers at Time Inc. The personnel files kept by Di Sapio's office include performance reviews, termination agreements and payouts, and a small amount of court records. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Archives transfer forms for Di Sapio's files are in her bio file (MS 3009-RG 2). Her files were sent to the Time Inc. Archives between 1988 and 1991. It looks like a large amount of her files were either culled prior to acquisition by the New-York Historical Society or possibly dispersed into one of the assembled collections created by the Time Inc. Archives.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rosemarie Di Sapio joined Time Inc. in 1961 as the secretary to the director of communications. She held positions on the business side of Sports Illustrated beginning in 1966 culimating in a position as the associate business manager from 1973 to 1977. From 1978 to 1980 she was the business manager of Money. She briefly held the position of Time-Life Films director of personnel and administration before being promoted to the Video Group director of finance and administration. At the end of 1985, she was named the corporate director of administration. In April 1987 she is listed as the director of administrative services for the Magazine Group which seems like the same role as before, but within the new Time Warner company structure. In August 1987, she is promoted to vice president of administrative services. The 1992 department heads list has her as the vice president of Magazine Administrative Services which sounds like it is still the same role within the Magazine Group of Time Warner. The Magazine Group later reverted to a subsidiary called Time Inc.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to a job description in Di Sapio's bio file, the director of administration supported the chief administrative officer. The CAO oversaw ISG (which is not defined), human resources, international administration, and the corporate business office. Magazine Administrative Services in 1992 oversaw Security, Dining, Telecommunication, Travel Services, and Facilities Management. Announcements about Di Sapio's promotions never state that she was taking over duties from retiring vice president Charles Bear although their roles were similar in some ways.</field>
