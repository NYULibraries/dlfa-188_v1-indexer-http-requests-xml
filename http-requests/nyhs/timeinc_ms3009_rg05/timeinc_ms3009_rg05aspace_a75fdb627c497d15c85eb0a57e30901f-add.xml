    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1968-1994</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Kelso Sutton's files span approximately 1968 to 1994 and originated from his various roles within the Time Inc. Magazine Group (circa 1976-1986), his time as president and CEO of the Book Group (1986-1993), and his corporate-level work as a Time Inc. executive officer while member of the board of directors (circa 1983-1993) and finally as executive vice president (1993-1994). Because there is some overlap with these four groups, especially for strategic planning files, presentations, and speeches, all of his files were kept together in a single series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Across the series, the files contain correspondence, memoranda, administrative and personnel files, group budgets and financial records, research material, strategic planning files, meeting notes, conference files, presentations with slides, and speeches by Sutton and other colleagues.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Magazine Group subseries includes acquisition files for Southern Progress Corporation, magazine development files for Picture Week, TV-Cable Week, and Woman, and scripts and audiocassettes for the short-lived Time World New Service radio program. There are also several folders carried over from Sutton's time at the corporate Circulation Department (1968-1975) for Life, Newsweek, and People, as well as files from the previous Group Vice President Arthur Keylor.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Book Group subseries contains correspondence with other publishing companies and book clubs, as well as files about Time Inc. subsidiaries such as Book-of-the-Month Club, Little, Brown and Co., Scott, Foresman and Company, Time-Life Video, and other post-merger Time Warner Publishing entities. There are also several folders retained from his predecessor Reginald Brack.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Board of Directors Executive Officer subseries features corporate-level development and strategic planning files, including the work of the Corporate Strategy Group, and files about the Time-Warner merger.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Executive Vice President subseries files focus on the Full Service Network, an interactive telecommunications venture by Time Warner.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There do not appear to be any files from Sutton's brief time as the publisher of Sports Illustrated in his files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Kelso Sutton worked at Time Inc. from 1961 to 1994 and held a variety of positions throughout his thirty-three year career. He joined the company as part of a management training program after graduating from Harvard University and began working in the Time circulation department. He subsequently became assistant business manager of Time in 1962, business manager in 1964 and general manager in 1968. In 1972, he was appointed director of the newly centralized corporate circulation department and elected as a company Vice President. He served as temporary acting editor of the Magazine Development Group for six months in 1976, after which he was appointed vice president of magazines for the Magazine Group. From 1978 to 1980, he was the publisher of Sports Illustrated. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sutton returned to the Magazine Group as the group vice president (1980-1984), executive vice president (1984-1985), and finally president and chief executive officer (CEO) (1985-1986). He was also elected to the board of directors of Time Inc. in 1983 and remained a member until his retirement. In December 1986, Sutton exchanged jobs with Reginald Brack and became president and CEO of the Book Group, which signaled a shift away from his previously powerful role within the company. He served in this role until the position was eliminated in 1993 after restructuring within Time Warner. Sutton then served as executive vice president for Time Inc. until his retirement in 1994.</field>
