    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Contract, Corporate, and Corporate Secretary Legal Files are similar to the subseries Dead Companies, but were not included on the lists found with the transfer of Dead Companies to the Time Inc. Archives. These are a mix of files from defunct companies and old business arrangements made by Time Inc. and include acquisition and sale agreements, articles of incorporation and dissolution, meeting minutes, correspondence, publishing contracts, and title searches. The files come from Arnold Carlson as Controller (or Comptroller), John "Jack" Harvey as Comptroller, Peter Sheppe as Director of Administrative Services (Comptroller department), and Dean Chamberlain (business manager Time-Life International and then Corporate Circulation.) There are notes showing that some records are from the "Contract file"; files sent to Ronnie Biehl for the "Corp file"; and files from the "Corp Sec [Corporate Secretary] Legal file cabinet." </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes extensive contract files from production of The March of Time. Records include leasing, financing, and distribution agreements along with correspondence from director Louis de Rochemont and Roy Larsen.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of records are restricted due to restrictions on contracts and agreements between Time Inc., its subsidiaries, and third parties. Open materials include articles of incorporation, board meeting minutes, correspondence, and title searches.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Additional and more complete publishing agreements are in the subseries Printing Agreements.</field>
