    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1954-1974 (bulk, 1968-1971)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Otto Fuerbringer's files on newspaper development contain research on newspaper companies throughout the United States either for acquisition purposes or informational purposes in order to create a Time Inc. daily newspaper. Research records include financials and other business reports, press releases, correspondence, clippings, and notes. Fuerbringer's files include originals and copies of documents from staff previously working on newspaper development.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">His files also includes records on the proposed Time-life News wire service and the acquisition of Lloyd Hollister Inc. and North Shore Publishing Company. The 1968 proposal to launch Time-Life News is in one of the general memoranda folders. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Fuerbringer's files include early research on The Washington Star. While his files indicate owner was not interested in selling in 1968, Time Inc. did acquire this newspaper later in 1978.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In May 1968, Time Inc. Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan appointed Otto Fuerbringer as the "chief explorer of Time Inc.'s interests and opportunities in the newspaper field," making him a vice president. Previously Fuerbringer served in several editorial roles at Time magazine before his promotion to managing editor in 1960. After Time Inc. concluded its exploration of newspapers, Fuerbringer held the first managing editor position in the Magazine Development Group. While head of this group, Time Inc. created and first published Money and People. Fuerbringer retired from Time Inc. in September 1973 although it appears he continued to act as a consultant in magazine and newspaper development.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Prior to Fuerbringer's appointment, others worked on the idea of investing in, acquiring, or starting a newspaper. They include: Director of Corporate Research and Development and Vice President Edgar Baker (1965-1968); a manager in the Comptroller's Office Robert Brody and his assistant N. J. Nicholas, Jr. (1965); Associate Director of Corporate Development Frank White (1968); Time-Life News Service Chief Richard Clurman (1967); Time Assistant Publisher Putney Westerfield (1967); Time editor Marshall Loeb; and newspaper task force member Shirley Estabrook (1968). </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">A 1967 memorandum from White to Baker lists the criteria for how Time Inc. would judge a possible newspaper acquisition. Criteria included editorial empathy so that the newspaper values were not resolutely different from Time Inc.'s; growth potential; existing market size; and favorable competitive situation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">One product of Fuerbringer's work in newspaper acqusitions was a proposal for Time-Life News, a wire service to sell news information to daily newspapers. Fuerbringer and Time-Life News Service Chief Murray Gart proposed it via memorandum in late 1968. Fuerbringer managed an additional project to explore this idea, and an experimental run occurred in June 1969 headed by Roy Rowan (borrowed from Life). Time-Life News ultimately did not happen.</field>
