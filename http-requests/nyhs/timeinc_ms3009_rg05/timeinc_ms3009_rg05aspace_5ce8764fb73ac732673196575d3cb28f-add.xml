    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of the correspondence and memoranda in this series are to and from Charles Stillman while he was the treasurer of Time Inc., but look like they were removed from the files of other staff members, mainly President Roy E. Larsen. A note from the Time Inc. Archives accompanying the files says, "Retain these folders intact for Mr. Stillman." indicating that the Archives considered these Stillman's records although they were collected from other sources.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of his interoffice memoranda are to the "War List" during World War II reporting on or giving commentary about financial, commodities, and labor issues during and due to the war, particularly issues that may affect Time Inc. or its subsidiaries and associated foreign publishers. The folder with memoranda from 1939 includes a list of staff on the various War Lists. Some memoranda include attachments of reports and other materials from outside organizations such as the Roundtable on National Defense and The Army Industrial College. There is also a small amount of correspondence during his work for the Economic Cooperation Administration.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some material was found loose and some was in existing folders. While the loose material could originally have been part of one of the folders, it has been house separately to maintain the original order since it isn't clear if some of the records were originally from Stillman.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Charles Stillman was an early staff member and officer of Time Inc. joining in 1928 as the business manager. He shortly was promoted to assistant treasurer. In 1930 he was elected the treasurer of Time Inc. Beginning in January 1949, he was both an executive vice president of the company as well as treasurer. Stillman joined the Time Inc. board of directors in 1948. From 1960 to 1968, he served as the chairman of the finance committee. Stillman retired from Time Inc. in 1970, but remained an advisory director to the board.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Stillman took leave from Time Inc. for six months beginning in June 1948 to head the Technical Survey Mission for the China Aid Program at the request of the United States Economic Cooperation Administrator.</field>
