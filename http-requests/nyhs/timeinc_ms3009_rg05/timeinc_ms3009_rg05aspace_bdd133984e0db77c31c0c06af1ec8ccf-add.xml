    <field name="scopecontent_teim">James A. Linen's appointment books document his activities while he was publisher of Time, president of Time Inc., chairman of the executive committee, through his retirement when he was still serving as a member of the board. Most years have two books with the same handwriting and matching appointments although both books do not always have all the same appointments. Usually one of the books has the JAL monogram. Possibly one book was for Linen's desk and one was for his assistant's desk. Some of the appointment books have the name of one of his assistants, either Gloria "Gigi" Conn or Janet Olson.</field>
