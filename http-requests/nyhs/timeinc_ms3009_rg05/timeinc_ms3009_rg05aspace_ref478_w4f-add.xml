    <field name="bioghist_teim">Reginald K. Brack, Jr. joined Time Inc. in 1962. After holding positions as the founding publisher of Discover magazine and group vice president of Time Inc.'s Books Group, he was named chief executive officer (CEO) of the Magazine Group in December 1986. In December 1988, this group became a subsidiary of Time Inc. known as The Time Inc. Magazine Company with Brack remaining the CEO. In September 1990, after the Time Inc. and Warner Communications merger created Time Warner, the magazine and book publishing subsidiaries consolidated as the Time Inc. Magazine Company with Brack becoming chairman of the board, president and CEO. The name of this subsidiary of Time Warner would revert to "Time Inc." by the end of 1991. In August 1994, Don Logan was named the Time Inc. president and CEO while Brack remained the chairman until 1997. Brack also served as chairman of the board of directors of the National Urban League from 1992 to 1996.</field>
