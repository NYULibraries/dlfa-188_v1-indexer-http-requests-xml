    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records from Patricia Ryan primarily contain correspondence to place articles or excerpts from outside writers. Outside writers include those from other magazines (sometimes other Time Inc. magazines), freelancers, and some amateurs. Files do not always have correspondence from the writer and may only contain internal correspondence regarding their article or excerpt. Topics include story ideas, submissions, the logistics of publishing accepted articles, and payment amounts. The correspondence is similar to that in Ray Cave's and Joseph Carroll's files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Besides the correspondence to outside writers, Ryan's files include copyright assignments as part of the correspondence files and memoranda to Sports Illustrated Managing Editor Roy Terrell. Her records also include financial records of the Text Department which seems to have reviewed submitted manuscripts.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Ryan's files are organized mainly chronologically then alphabetically and there is some repetition of names in each year. Correspondence contains general A to Z files followed by specific folders for individuals. It is possible materials from individuals with a specific folder are also in the general folder.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Patricia "Pat" Ryan joined Time Inc. in 1960 as a secretary at Sports Illustrated (SI). In 1971 SI promoted her to senior editor after holding positions as a researcher and writer. While the 1971 and 1974 SI masthead lists her as a senior editor, Ryan signs as Text Department Editor, and is also addressed as the articles editor. Her duties included negotiations with contract writers for articles and publishers for book excerpts. Richard Munro obliquely states in his SI September 4, 1972 letter from the publisher that Ryan was the first woman to rise to Senior Editor at SI. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In her Inside Time Inc. 1984 interview, she recounts the argument she had with SI Managing Editor Andre Laguerre over her byline after her 1966 promotion to staff writer. Ryan wanted her byline to be "Pat Ryan" rather than "Patricia" since she "felt that a woman's byline would be suspect in a man's world." In fact, she is addressed as "Mr. Ryan" in a number of letters in her correspondence. Laguerre agreed to the byline, but still listed her as "Patricia" on the masthead.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ryan joined People as a senior editor in 1978 and was swiftly promoted to Assistant Managing Editor, Executive Editor, then Managing Editor by March 1982. She was the second managing editor for People, and the first woman at Time Inc. in a top editorial position. According to a memoranda in Life Managing Editor Judith Daniels' files, Ryan was named Life Managing Editor in April 1987. She was fired in 1989 without an explanation though the The New York Times posits it was due to the rivalry between her partner and Time Inc. coworker Ray Cave and Editor-in-Chief Jason McManus.</field>
