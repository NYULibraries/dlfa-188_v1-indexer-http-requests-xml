    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records from Ray Cave span from a year when he served as a Sports Illustrated senior editor then an assistant managing editor and primarily contain correspondence to place articles or excerpts from outside writers. Outside writers include those from other magazines (sometimes other Time Inc. magazines), freelancers, and some amateurs. Files do not always have correspondence from the writer and may only contain internal correspondence regarding their article or excerpt. Topics include story ideas, submissions, the logistics of publishing accepted articles, and payment amounts. The correspondence is similar to that in Patricia Ryan's and Joseph Carroll's files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ray Cave started at Sports Illustrated as a reporter in 1959, was promoted from a senior editor to Assistant Managing Editor in November 1970, and rose to deputy to Managing Editor Andre Laguerre. After a "stint as Acting Editorial Director of all Time Inc. publications", Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan appointed Cave as Time Assistant Managing Editor in 1976. The next year, he became Time Managing Editor and served in this role through 1985. From 1986 to 1988, Cave served in several corporate editorial roles before resigning from Time Inc. in 1988.</field>
