    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes both incoming and outgoing business correspondence of Robert Ensko Inc. The correspondents include individual collectors/purchasers, museum curators, historical researchers, appraisers, engravers, silversmiths, dealers and other suppliers, and university, association, and other institutional purchasers of silver objects. Among the more frequent institutional clients appearing in these files are various units of Yale University and the New York Racing Association, which purchased trophies from Ensko beginning in the late 1950s (and perhaps earlier) for races at Aqueduct, Belmont, and Saratoga. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subject matter of the correspondence perhaps mostly concerns clients or potential clients seeking particular antique silver objects or reproductions of such objects. Requests for engraving are also common. Drawings and some photographs are found in the files as patrons described their objectives to Ensko. Ensko maintained relationships over the years with their individual clients and with their supply chain of dealers, engravers and silversmiths to satisfy client wishes, and so the correspondence reflects the ongoing development of silver collections through Ensko. The correspondence appears to be largely complete, running from 1936 (with a few letters back to 1934) through to the firm's close in 1970.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to documentation of purchases and other business transactions, the correspondence includes other matters that Ensko assisted with, including answering historical research questions from independent historians, such as Helen Burr Smith, and curators at Albany Institute of History and Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, Yale University Art Gallery of Fine Art, and elsewhere. Ensko also was called on to offer both informal appraisals of objects and more formal appraisals of silver holdings in collections and estates; the appraised inventories are found at various points throughout the files. Ensko also occasionally loaned objects for exhibition at museums and elsewhere and that is documented in these files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files also include some personal correspondence at points, and correspondence with the firm's attorneys and accountants that run on the border of personal and professional. The set of correspondence for January-June 1936 includes letters from the Smithsonian concerning British assay office receipts; six receipts dated 1796-98 were enclosed for Stephen Ensko to keep and these are in the files as reflected in the series' date range.</field>
