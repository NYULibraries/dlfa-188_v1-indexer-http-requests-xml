    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">circa 1934-1969</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries includes the files of bills/invoices paid by Robert Ensko Inc. from about 1934 to the close of the business in 1970. These bills include both general business expenses and payments to dealers, silversmiths, and other firms for silver reproductions and antiques, as well as to engravers. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Certain suppliers of silver objects appear frequently across the years, including Captain I.M. Harris &amp; Co., I. Freeman &amp; Son, Michael Feinberg Inc./Feinberg English Silver Inc., Ralph Hyman (London), H.D. Robbins &amp; Co., Reed &amp; Barton, L. Tobert (New York) and B. Tobert (London), and Tuttle Silver Co. Other dealers appear less frequently but still have a considerable presence at times including N. Bloom &amp; Son, Williams Comyn &amp; Sons Ltd., Currier &amp; Roby Inc., Reginald Davis (London), Elgin Silversmith Company, International Silver Co., Victor Obler Company, J. Ortman, William B. Meyers Company (Newark, NJ), and Wakely &amp; Wheeler (London), among others. Bills from two engravers stand out in their volume: William Carbine (from the 1930s until perhaps the mid-1950s) and H. Sigal Inc. (which appears on early invoices as Hillel Sigal). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although there is a substantial volume of bills from suppliers of silver objects, much of the bills paid files consist of general expenses, including those for shipping, photography, utilities, employee health benefits and other insurance, catering, office and display supplies, florists, various taxes, accounting services, legal matters, and the like.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries also includes some petty cash receipts, mostly from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, and cancelled checks, checkbook stubs, and bank statements for various years, especially from the 1950s.</field>
