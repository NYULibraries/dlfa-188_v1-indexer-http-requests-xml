    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1787, 1908-1971 (bulk 1950s-1960s)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes photographic prints and negatives of a wide variety of silver objects. Several albums include photos of trophies, with information about them, supplied by Robert Ensko Inc. to the New York Racing Association (NYRA) for "Run of the Mill" and "Stake" races at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga in 1960-1966. There is also a set of three albums with photos (and a small box of negatives) of the Firestone Collection, which according to a note in the albums was appraised by Stephen G.C. Ensko. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Beyond these albums, there are many other photographs, though their particular context is not clear. A large set of organized photograph files, originally in filing cabinets when received at N-YHS, seem likely to be mostly of objects that were in Ensko's inventory or of at least specific relevance to their business. These files include both photographic prints and negatives. They include both antiques and reproductions of styles designated on some folder labels as "English silver," "Sheffield," "antique English," "early American" (often abbreviated as E.A.), and "modern." The photos remain in their original folders with Ensko's labeling. Objects include trays, creamers, bowls, candlesticks, cups, coffee and tea sets, dishes, urns, strainers, porringers, tankards, shakers, sauce boats, flatware, Apostle spoons, etc. A separate set of several small boxes of negatives seem likely to relate to images of Ensko's inventory as well. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Retained in their original flat letter boxes as received at N-YHS are various photographs and other image formats that appear to be more research or reference-oriented, such as for Ensko's books, appraisals, client inquiries, etc. The content of these letter boxes were not closely examined by the processing archivist in 2021 and were left largely as found in the boxes. While much is simply loosely piled in the boxes, there are discernable relationships among some of the grouped photographs, such as maker, style, marks, collection, etc. These materials include annotations, brief notes, and other documentation. A few unrelated items, such as personal notes, a 1918 wedding invitation, and a 1787 newspaper, are found randomly among these documents.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Finally, there are three boxes of pictorial works, including bound copies of tearsheets of advertisements and articles about silver, a few museum exhibition and auction catalogues, booklets, postcards, and the like. Specific to Ensko are two copies of a small booklet published in 1934 by the firm that seems to be a primer on antique American silver for its clients or potential clients.</field>
