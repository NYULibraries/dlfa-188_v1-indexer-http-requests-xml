    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes hundreds of thousands of two overlapping documents: customer transaction tickets and customer invoices. Transaction tickets record client/customer object sales, repairs, engravings, and other client-related matters such as returns and credit memos. Data on the tickets include client name and address, object or service purchased, stock number, price, transaction and shipment date, shipping address, and other pertinent details.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is a high degree of redundancy in the series because there are as many as three copies of the tickets: one arranged and bound in alphabetical order by client, one arranged by ticket number (very roughly chronological), and for some, a third (pink color) copy. Nonetheless, for the earliest records in the series, from the early 1940s, there is only one copy of the ticket.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The invoices are carbon copies of the originals sent to customers. The invoices include much of the same information found on the tickets, but in much more polished form. The tickets are handwritten, often with detailed working notes and customer specifications. The invoices are typed lists or straightforward notes of the item or service purchased.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Taken together, the documents appear to be a comprehensive, detailed view of Ensko's client transactions. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A detailed understanding of the interrelationship of these documents and others from the business can be gleaned from a 1954 "Client order procedure" found in Series IV (Box 75). This was a procedural document apparently written for a new typist. The essentials of it seem to be relevant for tickets from the 1940s on through 1970.</field>
