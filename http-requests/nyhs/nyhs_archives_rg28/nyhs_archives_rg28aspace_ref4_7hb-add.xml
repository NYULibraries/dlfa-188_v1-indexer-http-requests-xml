    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes audiocassette tapes (and a few open reels and a tape cartridge) dating primarily from the late 1980s and early 1990s. Judging only from the labels, the subject matter appears to primarily include public lectures and presentations held at N-YHS and training/background sessions, likely for docents, educators and other N-YHS staff responsible for conveying exhibition interpretative comments to the public. Many of the tapes include the lectures, panel discussions and some concerts presented as part of the "Why History?" series that ran from 1990-92. Other tapes include lectures by guest speakers and N-YHS curators that related to exhibitions, including those by N-YHS museum curator Annette Blaugrund on Paris 1889 (1989) and The Taste of Andrew Carnegie (1991), N-YHS Librarian James Mooney on Putting New York on the Map (1988), and Professor Mosette Broderick on McKim, Mead &amp; White's New York (1991), to name just a few. Tapes related to docent training include, among many others, museum curator Ella Foshay on the Niagara (1986) and Hudson River School (1987) exhibitions, curator Tim Burgard on Thomas Cole's The Course of Empire (1989), and N-YHS educators Carole Slatkin and Jane Lattes on Audubon (1987) and firefighting (1985) exhibitions, respectively. Some tapes provide collection overviews, including an "Introduction to Department of Public Programs: Highlights for Teachers" (1986) and Ella Foshay on "Treasures of the New-York Historical Society" (1988).  Many tapes related to programs connected to the bicentennial of the Constitution are found in the series, including guest curator Betsy McCaughey on the exhibition Government by Choice: Inventing the U.S. Constitution (1987) and the series of educational programs broadcast on radio.</field>
