    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes moving image formats, primarily videocassettes in VHS, Betacam, and U-Matic formats. The bulk of these date from the late 1980s and early 1990s and, judging only from the labels, the subject matter primarily concerns programs held at N-YHS. Most extensively documented in these tapes are the lectures, panel discussions and some concerts presented as part of the "Why History?" series that ran from 1990-92. These series linked various programs to particular themes, including "Race and Class" in 1991 and "What is American?" in 1992. Educational initiatives are also documented here, including high school student mock Constitutional Convention debates, the Liberty Scholars partnership with Bank Street College, and the Lab School collaboration with I.S. 44. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The moving images also include public service announcements (PSAs), interviews, and exhibition openings. Many of these relate to N-YHS's exhibition Government by Choice: Inventing the U.S. Constitution and other tie-ins to the bicentennial of the Constitution in 1987. Tapes of special events are also included, such as some of the History Makers Award ceremonies (including the second one, in 1989, honoring Malcolm Forbes) and former President Bill Clinton's July 2001 appearance.</field>
