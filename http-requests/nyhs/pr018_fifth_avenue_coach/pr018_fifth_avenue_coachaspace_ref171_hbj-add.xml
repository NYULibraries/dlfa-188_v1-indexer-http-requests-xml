    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IX is divided into six subseries. Within each subseries, the items are arranged in an approximate chronological fashion. The cyanotypes primarily document the 146th Street station house and the 9th Avenue and 54th Street car house from 1897 to 1910. The small format bus views contain some replicas of the mounted images, as well as several supplementary views from the 1920s, including seven additional photographs of Bus 914 in front of City Hall on 23 December 1926. Later views from the 1930s onward include the buses of the Fifth Avenue Coach Lines. The earliest 8 x 10 bus views duplicate several of the mounted images, though the bulk of the images depict coaches from the 1930s through the 1960s. Many of the photographs from the 1930s and 40s represent the buses of the Madison Avenue Coach Lines, the Eighth Avenue Coach Lines, the Chicago Motor Coach Lines, and the New York City Omnibus Corporation, all under common control by 1936. The latest photographs from the 1960s depict coaches from the Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority, the entity that took control of the Fifth Avenue Coach Lines and its affiliates in 1962. Photographs of employees include two 1946 portraits of Operator Norman Peer, Badge 841, and two 1950s group snapshots of employees in the new locker room. Other views from the 1950s and 60s consist of executives giving speeches, attending at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and celebrating at a banquet.</field>
