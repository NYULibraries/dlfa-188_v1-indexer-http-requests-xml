    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Fifth Avenue Coach Company Collection documents the Manhattan company's buses, facilities, operations, and employees. Though the collection spans the years of the company's existence (1896-1954), most of the 473 mounted photographs date from 1915 through 1928. The photographs were commissioned by the company for advertising and public relations purposes, as well as for use in employee training. The mounted photographs were originally numbered consecutively and arranged in numerical order, with numerous gaps in the sequence.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Fifth Avenue Coach Company, incorporated in 1896, was a horse-drawn omnibus line originally founded in 1885 as the Fifth Avenue Transportation Company (Ltd.) to discourage the laying of trolley tracks on the fashionable two-way thoroughfare. Battery operated vehicles were quickly abandoned after their introduction in 1900 as a result of their expense and inefficiency. Horse-drawn London-type omnibuses continued to be used until 1907, when they were replaced by gasoline-driven motor coaches with French engines and London chassis. The company began producing their own motor coaches in 1914 and became well known for their double-decker models. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Fifth Avenue Coach Company became a subsidiary of the Third Avenue Railway Company in 1898 and the New York Transportation Company in 1899, gaining its independence in 1912. In 1924 it became a subsidiary of the Omnibus Corporation, which controlled the bus systems in New York and Chicago. In 1954, after acquiring the Hertz car rental business, the Omnibus Corporation sold the assets of the Fifth Avenue Coach Company to the New York City Omnibus Corporation, which was renamed Fifth Avenue Coach Lines in 1956. After a strike in 1962, the company's bus operations were taken over by the city.</field>
