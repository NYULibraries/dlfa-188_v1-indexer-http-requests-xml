    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes a diverse and idiosyncratic mix of printed materials dating from the 1950s to 2001, though mostly from the 1970s and 1980s. Very generally, the material concerns economic, political, cultural, and public policy matters. Most of the materials were created by New York City-based organizations, concern New York City matters, and seem targeted to a New York City audience, but some are of state-wide or national scope. The bulk of the series includes some form of periodical, especially newsletters, newspapers, magazines, and series of technical or policy reports. But with few exceptions there are no extended runs of any of the individual titles; most titles are represented by only a few issues, often only the first number of the title. Aside from periodicals, the series holds a variety of single issue documents of interest, such as commemorative booklets, souvenir programs, annual reports, calendars of events, publicity materials, and the like.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Newsletters perhaps form most of the series. These newsletters were created by government agencies, or groups within those agencies, for internal distribution or for the general public; public policy interest groups; political figures; commercial institutions; trade associations; and other organizations. There are also many small newspapers created for distribution within a specific New York City neighborhood, organization, or constituency.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A detailed list of the printed material was provided by the donor's family and is housed with the documents. The container list below summarizes most of these items at the folder level.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to these miscellaneous printed material the series also includes several New York City official directories, known as the "Green Book," from the 1950s to the 1980s used by Henry Walter.</field>
