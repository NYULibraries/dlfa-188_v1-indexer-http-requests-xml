    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes documents, much of which was prepared by Henry Walter, of a public relations nature for various public figures, other than Abraham Beame and Harrison Goldin. Most notably, these include Walter's files as Press Secretary for Robert M. Morgenthau during Morgenthau's campaign for Governor of New York in 1962. These files include press releases, speeches and remarks, drafts, correspondence, schedules, and campaign travel arrangements. The series also includes press releases issued by Walter in his capacity as the Director of Public Information for the newly-formed New York City Department of Highways (1963-64). Also from the 1960s is a folder of campaign brochures and other ephemera related to former reporter and Democratic candidate Martin J. Steadman's campaign for Congress from the 4th Congressional District (1966), with a letter from Steadman to Walter thanking him for his help and support during the campaign. </field>
