    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series includes Henry Walter's files from his years as an assistant for public relations matters, especially in connection with speechwriting, for Comptroller (1970-1973) and Mayor (1974-1977) Abraham (Abe) D. Beame.  The series generally includes three types of content: press releases from Beame's office and other public statements made by Beame; working files underlying Walter's public relations activities; and newspaper clippings. The working files include drafts and final versions of speeches/remarks, messages/greetings, daily press schedules, press releases, proclamations, briefing memos on appearances (e.g., other attendees, important background information, logistics), invitations for Beame to attend events and programs or other documents related to those events, internal memos, Walter's timesheets and daily to-do lists, city government agency reports, and other materials related to Beame's public appearances and communications. The subject matter primarily concerns city finances, politics, crime, drug abuse, and other such broad issues facing Beame, but also concerns specific events such as the celebration of the nation's bicentennial in 1976 and the power outage/black-out of 1977.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also includes some documents, including original correspondence, from the 1960s primarily related to Beame's positions on tax and revenue public policy matters, and some material from Beame's post-mayoralty years.</field>
