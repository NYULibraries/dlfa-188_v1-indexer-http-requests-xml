    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries primarily includes Henry Walter's files from his years as Assistant to the Comptroller for Public Relations, from September 1970 to the end of Abraham (Abe) Beame's tenure as Comptroller at December 31, 1973. The subseries generally includes three types of content: press releases from Beame's office and other public statements made by Beame; working files underlying Walter's public relations activities; and newspaper clippings. The subseries also includes some documents, including original correspondence,  from the 1960s primarily related to Beame's positions on tax and revenue public policy matters; these pre-date Walter's involvement with Beame and likely were given to Walter in connection with his public relations responsibilities. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Press releases are found as four bound annual volumes for 1970-1973 and as unbound, foldered documents for the same years. The two sets appear to be largely identical. One important known exception is that the unbound documents include the press releases issued separately during Beame's 1973 mayoral campaign and the transition period after his election. In addition to press releases, these documents include other forms of public relations material, such as speeches, remarks, messages, and the like. The sets each have "indexes," which include a table of contents indicating date and subject matter of the documents. The bulk of the topics concern financial matters, such as bond sales, budgets, New York City's credit rating, governmental unit reorganizations and appointments, mass transit fares, expenses (e.g., Board of Education deficits, process for awarding management consultant contracts), and housing construction. Many of the topics, though financial in emphasis, have broader implications as well, such as drug addiction/drug abuse, the city's costs related to United Nations operations, home rule legislation in the state, proposed Manhattan House of Detention (Tombs) prison annex, and the Yankee Stadium renovation. There are also topics concerning national legislation (e.g., wage and price controls) and international matters, especially with respect to Israel (e.g., support for Soviet Jews, call for a UN investigation into Arab guerilla sabotage against people flying in and out of Israel, providing military jet planes to Israel, remarks at memorial services for the slain Israeli Olympic team members). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Working files include a mix of documents, including drafts of speeches and press releases (including unused material), Beame's daily public schedules, carbon copies of outgoing correspondence over Beame's or Walter's signature, Walter's to-do lists, notes, and time records, clippings, and reports issued by the Comptroller's Office and other print matter, including the employee newsletter The Comptroller. One file includes the development of Beame's mayoral candidacy announcement, with Walter's observations on the events of that time (March 1973).  Threaded throughout the files are glimpses of Walter himself, including carbon copies of short letters to his mother or to friends and professional colleagues. Most of these files are structured chronologically, with all matters from a given period of time (typically one month) filed together. A few files are subject-oriented and include correspondence, press releases, and other documents related to particular topics. These include a compendium of mayoral candidate Beame's campaign promises and documents related to the efforts of one Abraham Broza to collect signatures on petitions in support of certain of Beame's positions. These files also include Beame's correspondence with state and city officials from the late 1960s, that is, prior to his comptrollership, concerning his positions on tax and revenue reform measures.   </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files of clippings include mostly photocopies of articles from the New York Times, Daily News, Post, and other newspapers that concern Beame and New York City issues of interest to Walter as Beame's public relations assistant. The files are especially extensive for 1973 and include the coverage of Beame's mayoralty campaign.</field>
