    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries of public relations files for the mayoralty years primarily includes Henry Walter's working materials as a speechwriter for Mayor Abraham Beame. The files include drafts and final versions of speeches/remarks, messages/greetings, daily press schedules, press releases, proclamations, briefing memos on appearances (e.g., other attendees, important background information, logistics), invitations for Beame to attend events and programs or other documents related to those events, executive orders, local law public hearing packages, clippings, internal memos, and other materials related to Beame's public appearances and communications. Subject matter ranges from general issues facing Beame, such as crime, politics, and business/investment climate, to specific concerns of the time, such as the city's fiscal crisis of 1975, celebration of the nation's bicentennial in 1976, the city's hosting of the Democratic National Convention in 1976, and the power outage/black-out of 1977. Files from the early months of 1977, during which time Beame ran for re-election as Mayor, include some memos and summaries related to political campaign messaging, but generally there are no extensive campaign-issued documents here. Some files include reports and other print matter and these are noted at the folder level in the container list below. Indexes to speeches/remarks given by Beame are available in the files; these tend to emphasize the group to or occasion on which Beame spoke, not the subject matter. The subseries also holds a small amount of material, such as clippings and reunion plans, relating to Beame but dating from his post-mayoralty years.</field>
