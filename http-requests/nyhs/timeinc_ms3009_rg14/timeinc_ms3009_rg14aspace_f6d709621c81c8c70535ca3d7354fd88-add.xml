    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Financial Files cover the period of 1956 to 1985 and contain materials related to the Time-Life News Service's finances. The majority of materials featured in this series were collected by Emily Friedrich, Linda Vartoogian, and Camille Cassata, also called Camille Sanabria after she was married, who appear to have worked in Time's Business Office and Time-Life News Service's business office. A variety of chiefs of correspondents appear in the records along with business office staff. Unlike other parts of Time Inc. that kept financial and editorial departments as separate, the Time-Life News Service had more overlap with chiefs of correspondents also overseeing the department's finances. The main chiefs of correspondents who were involved in business department affairs were Richard Clurman, Lawrence Laybourne, James Shepley, Emmet Hughes, Murray Gart, and Dick Duncan. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included in this series are budget reports, operating statements, financial statements, lists of salary account, bureau financial reports, Washington Star Payment Reports, contracts, lease agreements, clippings, newsletters, Time mastheads, receipts, notes, copies of checks, invoices, photos, negatives, itinerary, fee requisition forms, and correspondence. The correspondence included in this series discuss expenses, budgets, finances, committee meetings, expenditures, travel, allowances, fees, costs, raises, utility costs, financial payouts, financial issues, salaries, severance pay, visas, refugees eligibility, grocery costs, food stamps, doctor's appointments, money requisitions, contact info, and bureau updates. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included in this series are two files on the Washington Star. These files provide information about the Washington Star's financial relationship with the Time-Life News Service as well as the newspaper's dependency on the Time-Life News Service for acquiring information news.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Through 1974, Time-Life News Service's finances were handled by staff within Time's business office and were mainly overseen by an assistant manager. After 1974, Time-Life News Service had their own business office, but the department does not show up on department head lists in the Time Inc. Reference Files until 1987. Between 1974 and 1987, those who work on the Time-Life New Service finances are not named on department head lists. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Notable business department staff include Emily Friedrich, Linda Vartoogian, and Camille Cassata. Emily Friedrich does not appear in any department heads lists. Linda Vartoogian is listed in 1972 and 1974 as an assistant to Time's business manager but disappears from the lists after that even though she continues to work on the news service finances until at least 1983. Camille Cassata only appears on the 1987 departments heads list as the news service's financial manager, but the materials themselves indicate she may have been working for the news service as early as 1983.</field>
