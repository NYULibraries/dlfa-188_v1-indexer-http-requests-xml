    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Files covers the period of 1936 to 1987 and contain a mix of biographical and personnel files for Time-Life News Service staff, correspondents, and bureau chiefs. Due to the way that the materials are organized, it is unclear who collected or organized the materials. The files included in this subseries include a mix of staff that were currently working for Time-Life News Service when the files were transferred to the archives as well as files for ex-staff and stringers. If a box appeared to have files mainly for ex-staff or stringers then those boxes were separated and placed into their appropriate subseries. The remaining materials do not offer any indication of their original organization and have been interfiled into one subseries. While there are separate series for ex-staff and stringers, people that fall into those categories may be found in this subseries as well.</field>
