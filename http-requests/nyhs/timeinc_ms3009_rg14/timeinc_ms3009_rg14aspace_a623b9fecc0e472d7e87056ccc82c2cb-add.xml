    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Emmet Hughes Files contain correspondence, memorandum, and dispatches that Hughes received while acting as Foreign News Chief. While these materials were found with other chief of correspondent files, these materials were separated since they had a different organization, different folders, and a single collector. The correspondence and memorandum included in this subseries provide reactions and summaries to articles as well as bureau updates.</field>
