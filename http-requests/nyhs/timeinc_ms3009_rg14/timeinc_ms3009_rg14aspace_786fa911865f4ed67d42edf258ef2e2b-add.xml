    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Files cover the period of 1944 through 1987 and contain materials created by a variety of chiefs of correspondents at the Time-Life News Service. Several sets of General Files were found. It is unclear who grouped files from different chiefs together, if an administrator within the Time-Life News Service or the Time Inc. Archives was responsible. The separate sets have been grouped together alphabetically as one series. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Folder titles include a mix of names, places, and subjects. While the Bureau files subseries and Staff Files series contain folders with titles and materials similar to those found in this subseries, the materials have not been interfiled. The main reason that these materials have remained separate is because they were found stored and arranged separately from one another. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Contained in this subseries are payroll forms, employment applications, resumes and CVs, clippings, invitations, guests lists, dispatches, translated articles, benefits summary  sheets, annual reports, awards ceremony pamphlets, requisition forms, biographical summaries, press releases, conflict of interest and employment policies, department heads lists, error reports, evaluation guidelines, meeting transcripts, photos, negatives, contact lists, prospectuses, list of Time Inc. board members, news bureau surveys and results, distribution lists, financial statements and reports, seating lists and charts, vacation schedules, query sheets, lists of bureau staff, immigration and visa forms, reports on newstour participants, background research reports for newstours, reports attitudes toward Time, and memoranda and correspondence.
