    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Murray Gart Files contain materials collected by or sent to Gart from 1971 to 1976. Originally found with corporate editorial records, these files were separated and placed with the chief of correspondents' materials when it was discovered that Gart was the creator of these records. The type of materials in this subseries are similar to the materials found the General Files subseries within the Chief of Correspondent Files. Contained in this subseries are budgets, marketing reports, popularity reports, industry reports, executive summaries, lists of staff, dispatches, salary reports, affirmative action reports, meeting attendee lists, conflict of interest policy drafts, meeting agenda, and correspondence. Correspondence in this subseries discusses hiring, circulation, contract negotiations, New York City municipal work strikes, travel schedules, discrimination, traineeship programs, budgets and expenses, conflicts of interests, cost control, staffing changes, and lawsuits.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After working as editor at Weekly Independent Record in Cape May County, N.J., and as editor and farm reporter for newspapers in Wichita in the early 1950s, Murray Gart began his career with Time Inc. as a stringer for the Time-Life News Service but was soon hired as a correspondent. By the early 1960s he was promoted to bureau chief. Between 1969 and 1977, Gart served as the Time-Life News Service's chief of correspondents but left this position in 1978 to become the editor of the Washington Star. Due to financial issues, the Washington Star folded in 1981. At this time, Gart returned to Time-Life News Service, a subsidiary of Time Inc.,as a senior correspondent and later served as a consultant.</field>
