    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Richard Duncan Files contain materials collected by or sent to Duncan from 1980 to 1987. While originally thought to be general chief of correspondent files, these materials were found within their own box and had a single creator. There were no other chief of correspondent files other than the ones created by Duncan. The type of materials in this subseries are similar to the materials found the General Files subseries within the Chief of Correspondent Files. Included in this subseries are lists of meeting attendees, biographical data sheets, dispatches, translations of court documents, dinner event menus, a report on background material for the Korean delegation dinner, CVs, travel itinerary, and correspondence. The correspondence featured in this subseries discusses fellowship programs, meetings, new hires, travel plans, stringers, invitations, consultant reports, proposed projects, schedules, and itinerary.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Richard Duncan, better known as Dick Duncan, first shows up in Time Inc. department heads lists in October 1966 when he was serving as Caribbean bureau chief. It is unknown if he held other positions at Time Inc. prior to this. Duncan remained in this position until March 1969 when he was transferred to the Ottawa bureau to serve as their bureau chief. In 1972, Duncan disappeared from the department heads list but reappears in 1974 as the bureau chief of Beverly Hills. Sometime between 1974 and 1978, Duncan becomes deputy chief of correspondents and then chief of correspondents. Duncan remains in this position until May 1986.</field>
