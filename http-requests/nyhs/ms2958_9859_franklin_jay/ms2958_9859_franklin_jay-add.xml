    <field name="abstract_teim">Autograph letter signed, from Benjamin Franklin to John Jay. Dated Passy, January 6, 1784, and noted on the outside of the letter as received on January 15, 1784. Franklin opens by acknowledging Jay's letter of December 26, and assuring him that he had sent the enclosed to Mrs. Jay, whom he saw recently with the children, all of whom were doing "perfectly well" and "past the small pox." Franklin then writes of his own health, confirms that he has "the stone," but that it is "very tolerable." He describes the positive aspects of his health, notes that he is taking no drugs, and is of the view that with "abstemious living and gentle exercise" he can manage the stone "to the end of my journey, which can now be at no great distance," by which he is presumably referring to his life and eventual death. Franklin emphasizes his positive outlook on his condition by saying he is "more afraid of the medicines than of the malady." 

Franklin then considers the prospects for opening negotiations with England for a treaty of commerce. He notes that he and Jay have no commission to open such negotiations, though the Congress sends "with every dispatch" "a copy of the minute which directs the commission to be prepared." He encloses a copy of this to Jay. Though it is insufficient as authority to open negotiations, Franklin suggests it might "serve as ground for proposing a conference with one of the new ministers, in which you might discover whether they really intend a treaty or not." 

Franklin then reflects that he has enemies in England "as an American" and enemies in America "as a Minister," but no enemies "as a Man." He notes that Jay also has enemies, but that enemies should not make one "unhappy" because "they point out to us our faults; they put us upon our guard; and help us to live more correctly." Franklin then states that "three copies of the definitive treaty," presumably referring to the Treaty of Paris, had been sent and he awaited word on ratification. He informs Jay that he had received a letter from Mr. [David] Hartley regarding the change in ministry and quoting him as eager to hear of the ratification in order to bring "that blessed event to a complete termination." Franklin closes by conveying his grandsons' thanks for Jay's remembrance of them and expressing their best wishes.
