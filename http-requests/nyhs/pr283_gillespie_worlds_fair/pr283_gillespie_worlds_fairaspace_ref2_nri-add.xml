    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains twelve photo albums and three scrap books of unknown origin that were collected by Paul Gillespie.  Most of the albums and scrapbooks appear to have been created by different people who attended the New York World's Fair and contain a mix of amateur and souvenir photographs, memorabilia, newspaper clippings and some non-world's fair material.  Of particular interest is a "Diary and Scrap Book" that includes diary style entries documenting a visitor's thirty-three separate visits to the fair over the course of its two seasons, as well as a collection of fair ephemera.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A series of photographs that were originally in vinyl sleeves and bound as an album, were rehoused in archival sleeves and are located in box 5, folders 6-8.</field>
