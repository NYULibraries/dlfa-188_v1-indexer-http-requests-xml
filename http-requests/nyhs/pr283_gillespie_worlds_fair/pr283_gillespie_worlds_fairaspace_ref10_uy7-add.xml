    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries is the largest part of the Gillespie collection and consists of a large assortment of photographs by unknown photographers, covering a variety of subjects, styles and formats.  The photographs capture almost every aspect of the fair, including pictures of the fair under construction and images inside exhibits and shows.  Many photographs have a distinctly amateur quality in their choice of subject and composition, but a significant number demonstrate an advanced level of skill.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs in this subseries are arranged by size and format.  If sleeved, they are done so back-to-back if no useful information is written on the reverse.  Large photographs are mostly 8 x 10 inches or similar in size.  Medium photographs are mainly in the range of 4 x 6 inches to 5 x 7 inches; Box 5, folders 6 through 8 were originally bound together as a single album, but were rehoused for conservation purposes.  Included in the medium category are three folders that originally came from a single bound collection of vinyl sleeves.  Small photographs are mostly smaller than 4 x 6 inches.  This category also includes two sets of small souvenir photo cards that are still in their original packaging.  Color positives are twenty-six, 4 x 5 Kodachrome direct positive transparencies.</field>
