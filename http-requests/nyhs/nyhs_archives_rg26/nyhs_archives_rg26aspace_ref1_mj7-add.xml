    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes two sets of correspondence files. The first includes correspondence related to the management of the store's product line, with most of the letters directed to Lorelei Rowars, the Museum Store Director from the mid-1980s to mid-1991, when the store temporarily closed for almost five months. Subject matter includes arrangements for products to be developed and sold in the store, such as posters, catalogues, postcards, holiday cards, and other items; product proposals from vendors; arrangements for sales of museum store products through outlets other than N-YHS itself (e.g., holiday gift sales for local company employees), and related matters. These files were found during processing in 2016 as a complete set. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The second set of correspondence also relates to store management, but was compiled from various store files by the processing archivist. Principal subjects in this set include arrangements for the Adirondack Store to have a space at N-YHS during the exhibition Forever Wild, arrangements with Princeton Audubon Ltd for printing Audubon reproductions, store catalog production files, sales of the Phelps-Dodge Family book, and a sampling of mail orders received for store items.</field>
