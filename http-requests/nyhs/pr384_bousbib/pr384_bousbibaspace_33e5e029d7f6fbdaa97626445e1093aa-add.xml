    <field name="bioghist_teim">Napoleon Sarony (1821-1896) was the premier theatrical photographer of the 19th century. Born in Québec, Sarony moved to New York in 1836 and began his career in the lithography industry.  He learned his trade while employed by Currier and Ives, and eventually even set up his own lithography shop. He opened his first photography studio in 1867, near 630 Broadway in New York. 
Otto Sarony,  (1850–1903) son and heir of Napoleon Sarony, worked with his father. Otto began directing sessions that appeared under the Sarony signature in the late 1880s. He presided over virtually every session undertaken by the studio from 1893 until his father's death in 1896. From 1896 until October 7, 1898, he was sole proprietor of the business. In 1898 he sold the studio, including the trademark name "Sarony" to Jonathan Burrow. Otto Sarony managed the studio until his death in 1903.  To Burrow's chagrin, in 1902 Otto Sarony had sold the right to his own name to photographic entrepreneur Theodore C. Marceau, who set up a rival studio.  Sarony remained a viable brand in portrait photography until the mid-20th century.</field>
