    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of two photograph albums. One is the album of Louis Fabian Bachrach (1881-1963), and contains formal portraits and snapshots of his family, as well of the offices and employees of his photographic studio.  
The second album contains photographs of Louis Fabian Bachrach's mother, Fanny Keyser Bachrach (1854-1937), throughout her life. It appears to have been assembled by her children after her death.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Bachrach family has been in the commercial photography business for more than 140 years.
David Bachrach (1845-1921) founded Bachrach Studios in 1868. His son Louis Fabian Bachrach (1881-1963) began his photographic career by working with his father in Washington and Baltimore and by helping several photographers in New York. Louis Fabian Bachrach, Jr. (1917-2010), known as Fabian Bachrach, introduced color photography to the studio in the 1950s, while his brother Bradford (1910 or 1911-1992) headed the company until 1978. Fabian's son Robert now (2017) heads the family business, while son Louis Fabian Bachrach III has his own independent portrait studio.</field>
