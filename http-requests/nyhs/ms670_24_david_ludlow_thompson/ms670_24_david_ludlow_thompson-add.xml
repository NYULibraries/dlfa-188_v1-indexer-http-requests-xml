    <field name="abstract_teim">The David Ludlow Thompson Papers consist primarily of letters Thompson sent to his mother, Keturah Sayre Thompson, and his friend, Elias A. Fairchild, relating his experiences in battle during the American Civil War, inquiring about friends and relations at home, and asking to be sent clothing, food, and reading materials. Housed with each letter is a transcript provided by the donor that has been photocopied onto archival quality paper. The reader is cautioned against editorial mistakes in the transcripts. The "original" transcripts (i.e. those not printed on archival quality paper) are housed in a binder in Box 2, along with a wooden spoon carved by Thompson while he was held as a prisoner of war. Portions of this collection relating to the Civil War have been digitized and are available to on-site researchers and to users affiliated with subscribing institutions via EBSCOhost.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The David Ludlow Thompson papers consist primarily of letters that Thompson wrote to his mother, Keturah Sayre Thompson, and his friend, Elias A. Fairchild, describing army life, relating his experiences in battle, inquiring about friends and relations at home, and asking to be sent clothing, food, and reading materials. His letters also include detailed descriptions of the weather, the inedible rations, the ill-fitting garments provided by the U.S. Sanitary Commission, his poor attempts to mend his clothing, his bout with scurvy, and having to share his quarters with rodents and insects. His advanced education is evident in his frequent references to the literary canon, using quotes from Milton, Chaucer, and Tennyson to illustrate different situations.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most notably, the letters include a description of the Battle at Antietam and a letter sent to Elias A. Fairchild, declaring that David Ludlow Thompson had been declared a prisoner of war after Antietam.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also included in the collection are photocopies of articles written by Thompson regarding his experiences during the American Civil War, biographical information, and a wooden spoon that Thompson carved while being held at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia.</field>
