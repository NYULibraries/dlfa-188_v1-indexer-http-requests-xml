    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes about 1,750 applications for companionship (i.e., membership applications) from 1895-1963, with the applicant's service record (or of his ancestor in the case of a hereditary companionship); foundational documents from the Military Order's inception in 1894-1895; meeting minutes and related documents for the organization's early decades through 1922; photographs of about 100 companions, including its Commanders from the early twentieth century; a history of the national organization self-published in 1997; and other items.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Military Order of Foreign Wars of the United States, New York Commandery was formed in New York City in December 1894 by a group of veterans and descendants of officers of America's wars with foreign adversaries, specifically at the time the Revolution, War of 1812, War with Tripoli, and Mexican War. The organization was incorporated under the name Military and Naval Order of the United States in the State of New York, but it was immediately determined that the name bore a resemblance to a similar organization in Massachusetts. Consequently, in 1895 the Order changed its name to its present form.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The foundational declaration, or "Institution," of the Order's charter members cited the purposes of the organization, which included honoring the memory of the veterans of America's foreign wars, strengthening ties of fellowship among the companions (as the Order's members are known), fostering the cultivation of military and naval science, and maintaining national honor, union and independence. A constitution was established which included the qualifications for membership. The specifics of these have changed over the course of the New York Commandery's history, sometimes in exclusionary ways, such as the institution of a Caucasian [sic] racial requirement after World War I (eliminated around 1962), and sometimes in inclusionary ways, such as the removal of a male lineage requirement, but the principal thread throughout is that officers or descendants of officers who served in a foreign military conflict are eligible.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The formation of the New York Commandery quickly served as a model, and Pennsylvania formed its own Commandery in 1895, followed by Connecticut in 1896 and then several other states. In response to this sudden proliferation, a National Commandery was formed in 1896. The New York Commandery held its own annual meeting; the National Commandery sponsored triennial (later biennial) conventions.</field>
