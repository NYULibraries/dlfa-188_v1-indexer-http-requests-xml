    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series is comprised primarily of almost 100 photographic portraits of companions from across the history of the organization. All are identified by name and, for most, their companion number. These range from one of the group's charter members (#3, James Henry Morgan) to a set of photographs taken in 1990-91 during Operation Desert Storm with member #1955, Christopher Arnheiter. These photographs are of various sizes, ranging from small snapshots to larger, matted poses. There is a roughly even split between those that picture companions in their military uniforms and those in civilian dress. Eleven of the portraits are of companions that served as the organization's Commander from 1910-1937; these are identified in the container list. The series also holds a few group photographs from some of the organization's events, including dinners and meetings, and other graphic materials. All items are identified to some extent in the container list.</field>
