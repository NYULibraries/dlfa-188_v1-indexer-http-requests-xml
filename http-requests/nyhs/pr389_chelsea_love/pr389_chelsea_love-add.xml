    <field name="scopecontent_teim">One report from Marie-Louise Love (1922-2012) directed to Mr. J.O. Johnsen of the Drydock Savings Bank concerning the New York City neighborhood of Chelsea, with a particular focus on the building at 406 West 22nd Street. It is likely no coincidence that the subject address is also Love's residence, as seen on the transmittal cover letter to Johnsen. The report takes the form of an album of photographs, street maps, and text; a label on the cover refers to "Real Estate 191: Valuation and Appraisal" suggesting that perhaps the material was compiled by Love as an exercise or demonstration project for a professional training course. Whatever its original purpose, the report provides a real estate-oriented perspective on Chelsea as of 1961.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Love's report consists mostly of captioned photographs, but also includes her summary of the area's history, status as of 1961 of the area's demographics and built environment, the Chelsea Conservation Area Program, and Chelsea's transportation, recreation, religious, and restaurant and hotel facilities. The 406 West 22nd Street building is described in detail as to physical characteristics, monthly revenue stream from leases, operating expenses, and other data, with floor plans. There are two exterior photographs of the address and two street maps showing nearby religious and other institutional structures; a map shows that the address is within the Chelsea Conservation Area. 406 West 22nd became part of the Chelsea Historic District in 1970.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Photographs in the report include an aerial view of Chelsea, schools, churches, the Port of New York Authority Building, the Morgan Annex of the Post Office, the French Hospital, the Hudson Guild Neighborhood House, Ninth Regiment Armory, YMCA, the Muhlenberg Branch of the Public Library, Hotel Chelsea, Cavanagh's Restaurant, London Terrace Apartments, John Lovejoy Elliot Houses, a model of the Penn Station South housing complex, and various wide angle street views. All are black and white, most are small snapshots.</field>
