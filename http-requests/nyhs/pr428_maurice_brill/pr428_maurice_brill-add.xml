    <field name="bioghist_teim">Maurice Brill (1869-1951) was a clothier/haberdasher and, later, a real estate investor. With his brothers Samuel and Max, Maurice was the proprietor of the New York City men's clothing chain, Brill Brothers, founded in 1887. The operation expanded in the city, eventually to include a location in a building newly-constructed in 1930 at 1619 Broadway, at 49th Street. Shortly after its construction, the Brills bought the building, which became known as the Brill Building. The clothing business was liquidated in 1940 but Brill continued to own 1619 Broadway. He died in New York in 1951. </field>
