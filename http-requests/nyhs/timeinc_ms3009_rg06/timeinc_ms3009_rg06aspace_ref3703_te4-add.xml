    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These are a mix of office files created by the rotating corporate editorial position held by Richard Stolley, Jason McManus, and David Maness, and are primarily McManus's along with some of his files while he was Corporate Editor. The files are accompanied by a file list titled "Files from Rm 34-06." Files include reports on possible new magazines, reports on individual magazine activity on radio and television, correspondence among the editorial staff, conference and national organization materials, personnel policies, and various committee agendas and notes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jason McManus started at Time Inc. in 1957 as a summer trainee, and Time Inc. hired him in 1959. He held various writing and editor positions with Time rising to Executive Editor in 1978. Richard Stolley then McManus temporarily served on a corporate editorial assignment as rotating Assistant Corporate Editor from around June 1981 to November 1982 according to the Department Head Lists in the Time Inc. Reference Files. While serving at the corporate editorial level, McManus retained his regular title as Time Executive Editor. Since McManus held the temporary assignment after Stolley and also later became the permanent Corporate Editor, it appears that many files from the temporary assignment during this time span were taken over by his office. According to a transfer form, his office sent them to the Time Inc. Archives in 1987 which is when McManus was promoted from Corporate Editor to Editor-in-Chief.</field>
