    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Henry Anatole Grunwald Files primarily date from his roles at Time magazine as Senior Editor, Assistant Managing Editor, and Managing Editor; and roles at the corporate level as Editorial Director and Editor-in-Chief. Based on the accompanying archives transfer forms, all of Grunwald's files were transferred by his office while he was Editor-in-Chief. Therefore the records are not separated based on office and title, but kept in the series designated by his office on the transfer forms. Records include his internal and external correspondence, departmental files, files on Newstours he attended, speeches, and travel records.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In 2004, shortly before Grunwald's death, his files were reviewed by a family representative and parts were removed to return to his family. In most instances, photocopies take their place. In some instances, there are notes from Time Inc. librarian C. Weil indicating what was removed. Removals include "items of personal nature, family, real estate on Vineyard."</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Grunwald emigrated to the United States from Austria in 1940 at the age of 17. After graduating from New York University in 1944, he began his first job at Time Inc. Grunwald held positions as a foreign correspondent from 1945 to 1951, Time Senior Editor from 1951 to 1966, Time Assistant Managing Editor from 1966 to 1968, Time Managing Editor from 1968 to 1977, Corporate Editor from 1977 to 1979, and finally was appointed as Editor-in-Chief in 1979 by his predecessor Hedley Donovan. He also served on Time Inc.'s board. Grunwald retired from Time Inc. in 1987.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During his tenure as Editor-in-Chief, Grunwald appointed the first woman managing editor of a major Time Inc. magazine when Patricia Ryan took over People in 1982.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Shortly after his retirement, President Ronald Reagan named Grunwald U.S. ambassador to Austria. Beginning in 1997, Grunwald published two memoirs, One Man's America, recounting his experiences as a Jewish refugee from Nazi-controlled Europe and success in his adopted country, and Twilight: Losing Sight, Gaining Insight about his degenerative loss of eyesight. In 2003, he published the novel A Saint, More or Less.</field>
