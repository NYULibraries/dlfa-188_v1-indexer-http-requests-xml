    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While some of Marshall Loeb's files relate to his positions as managing editor of Money and editor with the corporate Magazine Development Group, the majority document corporate editorial activities during his tenure as assistant to the editor-in-chief Henry Grunwald. According to the list of duties in his files, some of his reponsibilities which these files reflect were to: evaluate Edit-Publishing projects and proposals; oversee relations with Publishing of the foreign publication Asiaweek; oversee the Time Australia editorial policy agreement; oversee Time Inc. history; arrange a Time Inc. takeover conference; maintain contact with Video Group and keep Grunwald and McManus informed; work with Frank Trippet on his minority writers program; work with Don Wilson on distribution of the Time Inc. history publication by Curt Prendergast; and represent Grunwald at various corporate meetings, budget reviews, and industry conferences. Some records earlier than 1984 look like they were passed down by prior temporary corporate editorial staff.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Marshall Loeb was a writer and editor at Time Inc. from 1956 to 1994. After holding positions at Time, Loeb became managing editor at Money in 1980. While holding this position, Loeb also served as an editor with the corporate Magazine Development Group. A November 5, 1985 letter from Loeb to Fred Gruin in his Miscellaneous file states Loeb is on a temporary assignment acting as assistant to Time Inc. editor-in-chief Henry Grunwald. Loeb's files show that he held these three positions simultaneously from around 1984 to 1986. The contents of the file Descripton of Duties has a list of his responsibilities as the "Third Man" in Corporate Editorial, after Grunwald and corporate editor Jason McManus. In 1986 he became the managing editor of Fortune where he remained until his retirement in 1994. </field>
