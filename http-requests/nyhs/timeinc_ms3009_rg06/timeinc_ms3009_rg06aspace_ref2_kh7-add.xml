    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I.A. Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan Files</field>
    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1948-1989 (bulk 1959-1979)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Hedley Donovan Files contain the files kept by his office while he was editorial director and editor-in-chief. The files also include some records or copies of records up to four years after his retirement. The files document his schedule, professional expenses, collected research reports, speeches, office subject files, travel, and draft memoirs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hedley Donovan was the second editor-in-chief of Time Inc. from 1964 to 1979, a position previously held only by the company's cofounder Henry R. Luce.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> Donovan was a native of Minnesota and after graduating from the University of Minnesota, he spent three years at Oxford University studying history on a Rhodes scholarship. Instead of accepting a Harvard teaching assistant position, after graduation Donovan took the better paying job as a reporter at the Washington Post working on general and political assignments. During World War II, he served in Naval Intelligence. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">  Fortune hired Donovan as a writer in 1945, promoting him to associate managing editor around 1950 and managing editor by 1953. In July 1959, Time Inc. announced Donovan's new position as editorial director, a deputy position to the editor-in-chief. While editorial director, Donovan established the Research and Development unit to conduct studies regarding Time Inc.'s ventures in television programming. In 1962, he was named to the board of directors. When Luce retired in April 1964, he recommended that the board appoint Donovan as his replacement. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> During his tenure as editor-in-chief, Donovan made the decision to suspend publishing of Life in 1972 for financial reasons and launched the magazines Money (1972) and People (1974). Under his supervision, the Magazine Development Group also considered other new magazine ideas: Well, regarding health topics; Camera Month; View, the description of which sounds like a precursor to People; and a women's magazine. Though the women's magazine received a title (Woman), and several years of work went into it, it was never realized. Time Inc. also acquired the Washington Star newspaper near the end of Donovan's tenure. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> In 1978, shortly before his retirement, Donovan presented a statement to the board to precisely define the role of editor-in-chief so that the office would be preserved for future holders. As transcribed in Prendergast and Colvin's book The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise, 1960-1980, he stated: "[The editor-in-chief] is responsible solely to the board for editorial content." "The board... delegates to the editor-in-chief the continuing appraisal and direction of the company's editorial work." "The editor-in-chief is a member of the board and of its executive committee." "The board does not expect the editor-in-chief to maintain the same immediate authority over the editorial work of Books and the [Washington] Star as he does over the magazines. He will, however, appoint the managing editor of Books and the editor of the Star..."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> His statement also defined the relationship of the editorial director as senior deputy to the editor-in-chief. This statement was formally adopted as company policy in December 1978.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> While preparing for retirement, Donovan recommended his replacement be Henry Grunwald with Ralph Graves as the editorial director. Donovan retired as editor-in-chief in June 1979. F.Y.I., the Time Inc. staff newsletter published a special issue of articles about Donovan on June 4, 1979. Though officially retired from Time Inc., Donovan remained a consultant until at least 1985.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> After Donovan's retirement, he wanted to take some of his files in order to write his memoirs. Two sets of copies were made, one for the Archives and one for the researchers and writers working on the history of Time Inc. book. The original materials may be in the papers Donovan's family donated to the University Archives at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim"> Beginning in July 1979, Donovan served approximately one year as a White House senior advisor to President Jimmy Carter. In 1981, he was the visiting journalist at Harvard University, and in 1989 Donovan published his memoirs Right Places, Right Times: Forty Years in Journalism, Not Counting My Paper Route.</field>
