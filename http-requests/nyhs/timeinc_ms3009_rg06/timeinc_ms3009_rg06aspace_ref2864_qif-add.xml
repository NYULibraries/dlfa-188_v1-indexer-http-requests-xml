    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Early Files and 1963-1973 make up two groups of files found housed together, respectively, that are not from a single year. They were kept in the found groups, but reorganized chronologically. Some of the files designated as 1973 date from 1970 to 1972. 1974 has two sets of alphabetical files; one was transferred with a form and one was not, but is similar, though not duplicates, to the transferred set of files. The Departmental Files contain some name and memo files similar to Interoffice Correspondence that are not duplicates. Since these files were transferred to the Time Inc. Archives as Departmental Files, they have not been moved to Interoffice Correspondence.</field>
