    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">circa 1880s-1960s</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Photographs series includes copy photos of architectural drawings, glass plate negatives, printed material (offprints from publications, entire publications, postcards), newspaper clippings, documents from Departments of Documents and Buildings (generally for New York City projects), handwritten notes, and sometimes correspondence or blueprints. (This series does not include photo albums; see Series V for those, along with scrapbooks.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">All folders contain photographs unless otherwise specified. For projects that have multiple folders of material, general descriptions of what is in each folder have been given. Projects that merely have a listing of their name are represented by a folder of photographs only. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sometimes images of other buildings may appear in a specific project's file. These were found with the other photographs in the file, and often cases have manuscript notations on them to "file in [project name]". They were most likely used as models for buildings, or contained elements or ideas that were to be incorporated into the project in question.</field>
