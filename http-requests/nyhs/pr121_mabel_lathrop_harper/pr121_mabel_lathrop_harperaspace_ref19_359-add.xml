    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II consists mainly of portraits of the Harpers and their close relatives, dating from 1872-1954, with many undated photographic prints. Photographs are arranged alphabetically by sitter with unidentified individuals at the end. Thereunder photographs are arranged chronologically when dates are available and alphabetically by description when dates are unavailable. Highlights include publicity portraits of Mabel Herbert Urner Harper, notably those by Jessie Tarbox Beals. Many portraits of Mabel and Lathrop were taken in their victorian home or outdoors in Gramercy Park. The family portraits focus mainly on Lathrop Harper's siblings: Ella Adelaide Harper, an amateur writer; Christina A. Harper (whose sketches of her mother are included with her mother's portraits); Francis P. Harper, his business partner; and James P. Harper, Jr., a prominent diamond importer. One of the photographs of James P. Harper, Jr. was originally framed; the frame was separated from the photograph during processing and can be found in Box 5. There is one folder of group portraits of the family. Also well documented is Lathrop's mother, Margaret Perego Harper. There are a few photographs of other members of the Arcularius, Perego, and Dimmock families for whom the familial connection is unclear. Photographers represented in this series include Jessie Tarbox Beals, R.A. Lewis, C.D. Fredricks, R. Horton, Fabian Bachrach, Davis &amp; Sanford, Underwood &amp; Underwood and Hargrave &amp; Gubelman. Related negatives can be found in Series IV.</field>
