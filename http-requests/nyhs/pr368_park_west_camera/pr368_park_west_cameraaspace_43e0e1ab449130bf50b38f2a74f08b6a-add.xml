    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains original photographic work by club members. Most of these are individual prints, often mounted on backing material, ranging from the 1940s into at least the 1970s, though most are undated. The work of Harry Noah is especially well-represented in these photos. Many of the photographs and their backing are water damaged, as they were rescued from a flooded room. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition, the series includes photographs from an album maintained by the club. These photographs are by more recent members, and date from the 1990s into the 2000s. Most of these prints are black and white, though many are in color. Finally, the series includes slides by some recent members, principally Myron Brenton. Brenton's slides are of various New York City scenes, including scenes at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A digitized slide show produced by the PWCC that includes some of these images and others can be seen here.</field>
