    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection includes newsletters and administrative records of the Park West Camera Club (PWCC), and examples of the photographs taken by its members. The records are not complete, but do hold substantial runs of important documents.  The newsletters date primarily from 1984 to 2014. Minutes of meetings are primarily from 1947-1959, with some from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of the club's group activities are documented, most notably its 2015 exhibition Through Our Eyes and the 2017 exhibition celebrating PWCC's 80th anniversary. Original photographic prints by members comprise a significant part of the collection. These photographs range in date from the 1940s to the early 2000s.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Park West Camera Club was founded in 1937. Originally called the Hypo Hounds, the club began as an educational offering of the 63rd Street branch of the YMCA in New York City. The group changed its name to Park West Camera Club in 1952. It remained affiliated with the YMCA for several decades, until the 1990s or early 2000s. At the YMCA the group had a basement meeting space with equipment for developing photographs. This space was also used to house the organization's records and select member photography. In the 1990s, the basement space flooded, destroying many records and photographs, and damaging others. The incident spurred the creation of an Archives Committee led by Myrna Harrison-Changar, which eventually drew on the salvaged material to mount the exhibition Eight Decades of Photography in 2017 in celebration of PWCC's 80th anniversary. The exhibition was held at the Soho Gallery in Tribeca, where PWCC had taken up residence after it spun off from its YMCA affiliation. As of 2018, PWCC still meets weekly at the Gallery. </field>
