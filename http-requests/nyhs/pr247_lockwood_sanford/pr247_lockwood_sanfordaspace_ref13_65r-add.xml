    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series I: Client Sample Books</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I. includes fifty-four small books (some hand bound with twine) in which samples of wood engravings done for Sanford's clients are pasted, along with the date done (or perhaps the date paid) and the price for each engraving. The engravings date from 1874 to 1910. The books generally show products sold by each client, but also occasionally include letterhead, cuts of factory buildings, business cards, and corporate identifications. Most books date from over a period of years, sometimes allowing the change in models and products sold by businesses to be measured.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The books in this series all measure approximately 9 x 6 inches. The client sample books are arranged alphabetically by client. Client names are written on the exterior of each book; it is sometimes the case that proofs for more than client can be found in one book. In this case, all clients have been listed in the following container list. Where a location of the business has been determined, it is noted in the container list. </field>
