    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II. holds sixteen compilation books of engravings, proofs, drawings, and invoices which were glued randomly in commercial books. One of these books was removed from the Album File, where it had been listed separately as an album (formerly PR-002-238). The material is not arranged in either client or chronological order. The work is largely unsigned. The engravings found inside date from 1838-1913. The bound volume in Box 4 includes an engraving marked "first engraving, 25th June 1838." The notebooks into which most of the proofs have been pasted were produced by Whitlock's Bookstore in New Haven; they are student workbooks for reading course, and are copyrighted in 1924, so that somewhat dates their creation. Frederick Sanford or another family member must have pasted in these engravings sometime after 1924.</field>
