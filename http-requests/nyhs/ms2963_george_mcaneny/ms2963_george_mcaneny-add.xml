    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born Christmas Eve, 1869, George Francis McAneny was a newspaperman, lifelong civil servant and municipal reformer in New York City. After graduating from high school in New Jersey, McAneny moved to New York to report for the New York World and began his work in civil service as the executive secretary of the National Civil Service Reform League in 1892, a non-profit devoted to promoting efficiency and anti-corruption reform in government. Over the course of his career he served the public in a variety of roles: as the Manhattan Borough President in 1910; chairman of the State Transit Committee, which helped create the early foundations for today's Subway system, in 1811; President of the Board of Aldermen in 1913; and as acting mayor during the absence of Mayor John Purroy Mitchel during that same year. With government reform and city planning always in mind, McAneny advocated vigorously for protecting public spaces and historical preservation. During his term as Manhattan Borough President, he restored 500,000 square feet of land to public use, and in the later years of his life, aided in the preservation of Fort Clinton, prevented the construction of a courthouse in City Hall Park, and was responsible for zoning ordinances which focused on building height. In 1933, he served as city comptroller. Additionally, he was one of the founders and the first president of the World's Fair of 1939 and 1940 and served as the President of American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. McAneny married Marjorie Jacobi and they had six children, Ruth, Elizabeth, Herbert, Arnold, Ernest and David. At the time of McAneny's death in 1953, he had nine grandchildren and two great grandchildren.</field>
