    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III. Images contain primarily gelatin silver photographs of the Chamber of Commerce as well as portraits of members and events. The series has been divided into two subseries: Photographs and Non-Photographic Images.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries I. Photographs contains albumen and gelatin silver prints ranging in size from 6 1/4 x 8 1/4 inches to 16 x 21 inches. Many of these are mounted on board and are extremely fragile. Among these photographs are images of the Chamber of Commerce Building at 65 Liberty Street, including exterior images by Pach Brothers and a large number of interior photographs. Portraits include both individual and group portraits. Individual portraits show Edward VIII, Prince of Wales during his visit to the Chamber of Commerce in 1919 and Georges Clemenceau, former prime minister of France, at a Chamber of Commerce meeting in 1922, as well as John Lindsay delivering a speech in the Great Room. Group portraits include member banquets and images of Li Hung Chang's visit to Grant's Tomb. Events show both the dedication of the Washington statue at the Sub-Treasury Building as well as the celebration commemorating the 150th anniversary of the inauguration of George Washington. Miscellaneous photographs contain a single aerial view of Jones Beach, including the water tower.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II. Non-Photographic Images contains two portraits. One, a reproduction of an etching, is a portrait of Isaac Low. The other is a painted portrait of an unidentified man. </field>
