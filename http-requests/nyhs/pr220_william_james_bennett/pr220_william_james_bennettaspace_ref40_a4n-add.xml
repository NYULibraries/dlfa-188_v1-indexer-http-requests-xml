    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series II: Views outside New York City</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II. includes the remaining nine prints from Bennett's folio views. These are mainly city views, including prints showing Detroit, Charlestown, Baltimore, West Point, Richmond, Buffalo, Mobile, and New Orleans. It also includes three different views of Niagara Falls and one print of the Trenton Falls near Utica, New York. The cities included here are notable as a group for their close proximity to and dependence on water. Many of these views use an elevated perspective to look down on the city shown, often from across a body of water or atop a topographical feature.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also includes all seven illustrations of the Croton Aqueduct, plates which were engraved by Bennett after Fayette B. Tower's drawings. These prints, as well as other views by different engravers, were published in Tower's Illustrations of the Croton Aqueduct (New York: Wiley and Putnam, 1843).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Prints are listed chronologically by date painted or engraved, and are black and white aquatints unless otherwise noted. </field>
