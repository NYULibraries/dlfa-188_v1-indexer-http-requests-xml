    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1 volume compiled by Clarkson Maverick (fuller name was William K.C. Maverick), an actor primarily of comedic roles often, judging from some documents in the album, based on Irish characters, masquerades, and minstrelsy. Maverick's inscription at the front of the album says it is "a book for miscellaneous matter, scraps, &amp;c." and is dated April of 1860. Much of the early pages of the album relate to theatre, to Maverick, and to his wife, Persis (Jones). They married in 1874 and she died in 1895. Documents include concert programs, some of which included Maverick (e.g. performances of the Jolly Comedians in Hoboken, N.J.); writings by Maverick; Red Star Line and Inman Line steamship passenger lists; and birthday and holiday greetings. Related clippings are mixed in, most notably for an 1896 event in Windham, N.Y. at which Maverick appeared dressed as a woman and in blackface to recite Lucy Stone Blackwell's lecture on women's rights. Much of the album, though, consists of miscellaneous clippings, related to the Civil War (1860s), Tammany Hall (1880s-90s), literary pieces, anecdotes, and other matter. Some original documents (one dating to 1830) refer to Samuel Maverick, possibly Clarkson's father. Source: Purchase with the Wilbur Fund, February 1945.</field>
