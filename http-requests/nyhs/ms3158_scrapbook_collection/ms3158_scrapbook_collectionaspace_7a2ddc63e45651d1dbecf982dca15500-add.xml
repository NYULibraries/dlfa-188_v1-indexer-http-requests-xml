    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4 volumes of newspaper clippings (and some full newspapers), programs, bulletins, invitations, postcards, pamphlets, etc., compiled by photographer and lecturer George E. Stonebridge (died 1941). N-YHS holds a large collection of his photographs and some family papers. One of the volumes primarily centers on announcements and other ephemera related to Stonebridge's public lectures for the New York City Department of Education and others, 1907-26. The other three volumes include clippings about Stonebridge, poems and articles that he wrote and were published in the press (e.g., the North Side News), published images of his photography, and ephemera related to his membership in the Bronx Society of Arts and Sciences and other organizations. Overall the documents relate largely to Tremont and other areas of the Bronx. (The volumes were likely donated in 1942 with the photographs, but separated.)</field>
