    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">circa 1829-1935</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4 volumes, primarily of clippings, concerning the history of New York City from colonial days to the 1930s, though especially 19th century and earlier. The emphasis generally seems to be on buildings, events, and prominent people. It is not known if Stack compiled the volumes, or collected them as is. This first album (in Box 50) is a palimpsest volume, formerly holding invoices of the 1890s which were largely removed, with clippings ranging from the 1880s to the 1920s, and mostly concern the subjects of women in the city, the 1896 police "Sherry raid" involving the dancer "Little Egypt," the sinking of the Lusitania and the Titanic, and the General Slocum explosion. The second volume (in Box 64) ranges from roughly 1829 to 1929 and has ephemera and pictorial works as well as clippings. The third and fourth volumes (in Boxes 64 and 65) are entirely clips and are very unstructured with most of the content consisting of loose items; they range from the mid 1800s into the 1920s and 1930s also. Source: Gift of J.B. Stack, November 4, 1953. (See also below circa 1890 for Stack's scrapbooks on boxing.)</field>
