    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Carney was a member of New-York Historical Society. He was Recording Secretary and member of the Executive Committee from 1900-1904. For a time he was on the Building Committee during the initial construction of the Central Park West building in the early 1900s. This third scrapbook primarily includes documents related to Carney's membership and positions of responsbility at N-YHS. Documents in that regard include correspondence from other historical societies, meeting and other announcements, printed lectures, photograph of Librarian William Kelby, acknowledgements of Carney's gifts to N-YHS, and print matter concerning the developing new building. One unique document here is architect York &amp; Sawyer's original design for the trowel used for the groundbreaking. The album also includes documents from Carney's memberships and interests in other religious, cultural, and other organizations. These especially include the Cathedral Choir School of St. John the Divine and programs etc. from several other churches.</field>
