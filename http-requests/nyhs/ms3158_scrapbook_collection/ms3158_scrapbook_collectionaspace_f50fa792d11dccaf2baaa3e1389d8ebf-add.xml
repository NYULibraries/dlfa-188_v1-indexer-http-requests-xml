    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1 volume of newspaper clippings compiled by J.E. Brush (1818-1889) of New York City. Though a layman, Brush was involved with several religious (Protestant Christian) and charitable efforts. He was a member of St. Paul's Evangelical Church. Most of the clippings in this album reflect his religious interests and apparently are drawn principally from the "Herald of Religious Liberty." Many of the articles were written by Brush. The articles range from brief announcements of events, such as religious conferences/gatherings, to longer articles about spiritual matters. There are many articles on religious personalities, their appearances/public remarks, obituaries, etc. Brush was on the Board of Control and treasurer of the Franklinton (North Carolina) Mission, also known as the Franklinton Colored School, so several clippings pertain to that. There is a cabinet card photograph of Brush. Source: Inscribed in the album is a statement of its provenance: It was a gift to N-YHS from Thomas Ollive Mabbott in September 1922, who purchased it at a bookstall.</field>
