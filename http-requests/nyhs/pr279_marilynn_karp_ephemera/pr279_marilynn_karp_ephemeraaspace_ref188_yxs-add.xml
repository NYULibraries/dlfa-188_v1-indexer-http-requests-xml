    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The invention of transfer decals, attributed to the French engraver Simon Fran√ßois Ravenet (a process he coined "decalquer" or "to copy by tracing"), originated in England in the mid 18th century, initially as a method by which to transfer decorative designs to pottery using engraved copper plates and tissue paper. Over the course of the 19th century, a variety of advancements in technology such as lithography, the paper making machine, and the invention of duplex paper, made the affordable mass production of decals possible. The introduction of silk screen printing in the early 20th century allowed a top-coat or cover-coat of lacquer to be added to the decal design (so-called water-mount decals) which could be transferred when wet.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Introduced to the United States by approximately 1865, the demand for decals reached its zenith in the 1870s resulting in what came to be called "decalcomania."  Decals remain popular today offering an inexpensive way to decorate and enhance a variety of objects and surfaces.</field>
