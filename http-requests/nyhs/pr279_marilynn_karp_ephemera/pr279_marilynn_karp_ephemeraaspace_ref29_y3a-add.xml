    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hairnets (once known as "cauls," or "snoods") have been used in various forms since ancient times, serving both utilitarian and decorative purposes. While initially constructed of materials such as silk and ribbon, the first commercial reference to hairnets made of human hair appeared in July, 1863, as an editorial feature in Peterson's Magazine (Vol. XLIV, No. 1). By 1914, the hairnet was a common hair accessory for women, and over the ensuing years became increasingly promoted for use in the nursing and food service professions. The emancipated bobbed hairstyles of the 1920s brought a temporary decline in the use of hairnets. Their popularity was revived by World War II, a period which saw the return of longer hairstyles and the entrance of women into the industrial workforce. Further refinements to hairnet manufacturing included the introduction of Du Pont's multifilament nylon yarn in 1940, offering unprecedented resiliency and wear.</field>
