    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Ration Books and OPA Points:
In August, 1941, President D. Roosevelt created the Office of Price Administration (OPA) in order to regulate both the purchase and cost of consumer goods during a period of severely limited imports and wartime shortages. By the spring of 1942, the first of 4 series of War Ration Books and stamps or "points" were issued to each American family. The program served as a way to promote the "fair share of certain goods made short by war," and carefully control the amount of foods, necessities, and luxuries any one person could buy. For the average citizen, such daily sacrifice represented a challenging but essential and patriotic contribution to the American war effort. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Army Navy Hit Kit Songs:
In 1941, a Sub-Committee on Music was established by the Joint Army and Navy Committee on Welfare and Recreation to advise the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps on matters relating to musical activities and entertainment for servicemen both in and outside military camps and reservations from 1941-1946. A popular part of this program began in 1943 with the monthly issuing of pamphlet-size songbooks called "Army Navy Hit Kits" containing the lyrics and music of popular songs of the period, including both "Hit Parade" and patriotic-themed songs. Important morale boosters during the war years, Hit Kit pamphlets, issued by the War Department's Special Services Division, were available only to military personnel and not for sale to the general public.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">U.S. War Department Photographs:

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Smilin' Jack Bubblegum Cards:
Full, uncut set of 128 Smilin' Jack bubblegum cards with "Buy War Bonds &amp; Stamps for Victory" on verso. This set is based on the 1943 movie serial, and the aviation comic strip (also 1943).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Posters:
During World War II, American government officials successfully harnessed the use of propaganda through the poster medium in an effort to mobilize the nation towards a united and urgent support for the war effort and American victory. A major function of the Office of War Information (OWI), created in 1942, was responsibility for controlling the content and imagery of war posters, and ensuring their monthly distribution and promotion across the nation. Drawing from the powerful and persuasive stylistic conventions of the advertising industry, American home front posters embraced American consciousness with themes that emphasized the nature of the enemy, the nature of the allies, the need to work, fight, and sacrifice, and the need to protect the principles of American freedom.</field>
