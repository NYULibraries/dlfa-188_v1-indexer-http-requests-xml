    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Francis G. Landon (1859-1947) was a politician from New York City. He joined the 7th Regiment as a private, rose through the ranks and was promoted to Major. During the period ca.1912 to ca.1916, he was involved in the education of military officers, initially as a student, but later, apparently, as an instructor. Following the United States' declaration of war against Germany in 1917, Landon served as Morale Officer at Camp Merritt, NJ. This series consists of material that Landon accumulated primarily during these two stages of his career. The series is divided into three principal subseries. These are: General Correspondence, Military Education, and Camp Merritt, NJ.</field>
