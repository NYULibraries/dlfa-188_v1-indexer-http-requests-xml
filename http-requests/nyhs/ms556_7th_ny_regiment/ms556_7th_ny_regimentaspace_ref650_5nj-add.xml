    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Material in the Military Education subseries consists primarily of small booklets of problem-solving exercises for military officers. These booklets were published by the Army Service Schools, where Landon attended classes during the academic year 1913 - 1914, and perhaps at other times. For purposes of the arrangement of this series, these booklets are referred to as Map Problems, the genre name applied to most of the booklets. In those instances that Landon kept a map with the booklet, they are housed together. Otherwise, maps are housed separately. Also included in this subseries are Landon's solutions to some of the Map Problems, evidently composed as course work, and some problems that appear to have been composed by Landon, perhaps for courses that he taught. This material is arranged according to the particular school that issued it, or, if no specific school is identified, the course to which it pertains. If no school or course is specified, the folder title indicates only the type of material found within it.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Landon appears to have taught at least one course in military tactics. Some material in the collection appears to be lecture notes or typewritten handouts that accompanied lectures. It some cases, it is unclear whether these notes and handouts are from lectures that Landon attended, or whether he composed them for lectures that he delivered. Some notes and typescripts pertaining to Landon's military education at Fort Leavenworth are identified as such. </field>
