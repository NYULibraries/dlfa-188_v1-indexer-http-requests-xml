    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes correspondence, business and legal papers, and pressed copies of letters belonging to the merchant William George Stewart. The majority of the materials concern Stewart's business ventures both in the United States and abroad, including Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and England. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A large portion of the series relates to Stewart's attempts to build a telegraph line in Mexico. These include correspondence related to the construction of the first telegraph in Mexico which was an effort shared between Stewart and his longtime friend Juan de la Granja. Therefore, much of the materials concern De la Granja and there are several personal letters of his scattered throughout the length of the collection. Furthermore, there are documents related to the financial and legal disputes that occurred between Stewart and De la Granja concerning the construction of the telegraph line. Once De la Granja dies in 1853, much of the materials relate to Stewart's attempts to build a second telegraph line in Mexico. These include letters to several Mexican government officials in order to receive permission for the construction as well as financial support for the project.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series also concerns Stewart's other business ventures which include that of printing.  There are papers related to Stewart's function in the building of a paper mill in Cuba. These include correspondence with Estevan Mestre, who was in charge of the project, which mention Smith, Winchester, &amp; Co. and William Kemble from West Point Foundry. Some correspondence relates to the printing of several books, pamphlets, and newspapers in the United States and across Latin America.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials of this series also provide insight into US-Mexico relations before and after the Mexican American War.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also contains some correspondence that relates to the "Amistad" schooner controversy.
