    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Managing Editor Robert Lubar's correspondence files cover the period of 1969 to 1977 and contain correspondence that Lubar sent and received during his time as assistant managing editor, acting managing editor, executive editor, and managing editor of Fortune. Records include responses to company executive readers, responses regarding article errors, and arrangements with guest writers. The topics covered in the correspondence include discussion of editorials, the relationship between government and businesses, requests for meetings and speakers, requests for assistance with research projects, restaurant and research recommendations, and meeting and conference agenda. Correspondence files from 1971 were not found while processing the series although one exchange with Roy Hurley was found later among unrelated material.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Robert "Bob" Lubar began his career with Time Inc. in 1946 as a writer for Time in Manhattan. During his tenure with Time,  Lubar held posts in London, New Delhi, Bonn, and Mexico City. After 12 years with Time, in 1958, Lubar was moved to Fortune where he was promoted to the position of associate editor. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lubar remained an associate editor for six years before becoming assistant managing editor in 1964. While his predecessor Managing Editor Louis Banks was on leave as a fellow at Harvard in 1969, Lubar filled in as acting managing editor. In early 1970, Lubar was signing off as an executive editor. In later 1970, he took over from Banks as managing editor of Fortune. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During the ten years that Lubar was managing editor, he oversaw the transition of the magazine to a smaller format and  the magazine's move from a monthly to bi-weekly publication. After leaving his position as managing editor, Lubar remained with Fortune as a chief of research until he retired in 1985.</field>
