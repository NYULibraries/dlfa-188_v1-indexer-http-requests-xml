    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series V contains only four prints, though each appears to be quite lovingly composed, attesting to Genthe's admitted lifelong passion for felines. None of the prints are dated, but given other factors and events in Genthe's life, it is estimated they were shot in the 1920s. The prints are approximately 10 inches by 13 inches, or the reverse, and are arranged alphabetically by title. Genthe's adored cat Buzzer (he had four to whom he gave that name) is featured in at least two of the photographs: One has Buzzer curled up on a chair, resting his head on a Chinese doll that is almost his size; the other shows Buzzer contentedly lounging on a couch. A third shot is of a cat (possibly Buzzer) perched atop wine barrels, sun and shadows playing off barrels and cat. The fourth was taken of a cat in a courtyard in New Orleans, when Genthe visited that city in the early 1920s and took a number of architectural shots.</field>
