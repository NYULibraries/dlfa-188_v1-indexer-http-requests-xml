    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VI contains numerous subjects in more than 3,200 nitrate and acetate negatives, though only a handful match up with the vintage prints in this collection - perhaps not surprising considering these were a separate acquisition from the Library of Congress. The series includes personalities such as Greta Garbo and J. P. Morgan; Genthe on horseback; numerous sitters for studio portraits; San Francisco's Chinatown; New York City buildings in 1931 and Central Park; Long Island houses, gardens, and hunting grounds; White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; views of New Orleans, Guatemala, Japan, and various locales in Europe; and dance groups, including Isadora Duncan's troupe and the Marion Morgan group. Dated negatives span 1913-1942, but the size of the Chinatown film negatives suggests that they may be the original 1890s exposures taken with a handheld camera.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">An item list is not available for this series, which contains more than 3,200 items, many of which are duplicates or near-duplicates. However, a database is available for browsing. Probably most useful to researchers is the ability to search by name of sitter or by subject. Of the latter, subjects used for the Genthe's photographs are used in the database as well, in addition to several added subjects: Buildings, Interiors, Art Objects, Documents, and Events.</field>
