    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Dr. Weisman's interest in early skyscrapers and commercial architecture is well represented in this collection of photos. This series contains approximately 3,500 black and white photographic copy prints, 8 x 10 inches mounted on boards. They depict commercial buildings throughout New York City and its SoHo district, as well as other cities across America, ranging from Albany, Boston, and Chicago to Philadelphia, and also including several foreign cities. All buildings in Manhattan are named, if known, and only significantly represented buildings in other cities are named.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The mounted prints consist of copy prints of buildings that were used by Winston Weisman in his lectures and research. Many of the prints in this series are taken from books, such as King's Handbook of New York City and Baxter's View: Panorama and Business Directory of Philadelphia: 1856 by D.W.C. Baxter, or from architecture magazines from the period 1850s to the early 20th century. These prints contain material relating to an extensive pictorial documentation to support several areas of Weisman's research, such as that commissioned by Pennsylvania State University -- National Science Foundation "Project Soho", and The New York City Landmark Preservation Commission in the early 1970's in addition to his earlier work on commercial architecture, particularly early skyscrapers and cast iron buildings.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of particular note are those cast iron buildings represented beyond the Soho district. Weisman sought out print copies of buildings by James Bogardus whose cast iron works were the earliest and most influential. The Eccentric Mill Works had a complete metal frame, including prefabricated columns, beams and wall panels. It was completed in 1849 at the corner of Duane and Centre streets and disassembled ten years later to widen Duane Street. The most elaborate Bogardus building was Harper and Brothers on Franklin Square in 1854 (razed in 1920). It was not a complete cast iron building like the Eccentric Mill Works as it used masonry in the fa√ßade and load bearing walls. Bogardus showed his imagination in the girders he designed for Harper. The girders he provided were of cast iron shaped like arches, with rods along the bottom of wrought iron, a far more elastic material, to correct the problem of cast iron cracking at the bottom due to their crystalline and brittle structure. Soon the wrought-iron rolling mills were turning out full-sized structural members. Bogardus had anticipated the use of extra-strength steels in parts of modern buildings. His second cast iron front building, after the Laing Stores represented in the fifth series in this collection, was a significant leap in terms of size and complexity. Begun in April 1850 by Bogardus, with architect Robert Hatfield, the five-story Sun newspaper building in Baltimore was both cast iron fronted and cast iron framed. Other significant buildings by Bogardus among the mounted copy prints are the watchtower at Mount Morris Park, the John Mihau Drugstore, the McCullough Shot Tower, Charles Ahrenfeldt &amp; Son Building, and the lighthouse at Santo Domingo.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is a mounted copy print of a representation from a magazine of the first electric passenger elevator, which was installed in the Demarest Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City in 1889 by the Otis Company. This print is among the several images of early elevators, an important element studied by Weisman in looking at early skyscrapers, which he often referred to as "elevator buildings".</field>
