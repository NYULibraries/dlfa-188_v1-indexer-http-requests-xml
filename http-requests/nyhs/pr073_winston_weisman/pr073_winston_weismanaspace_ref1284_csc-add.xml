    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series III Card Files</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of 4 x 6 file cards with information considered important by Weisman about a particular building or building type. Most of these cards are of a bibliographic nature with quotes and sources listed on the card, filed under approximate date of the building construction, predominantly for buildings in New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston. The cards have been left in Weisman's original order with his original category titles (additional descriptions are given in brackets), with the exception of a miscellaneous box subsequently placed within this original arrangement. There are small 3 Â½ x 5 inch photos scattered among the note cards, almost of all of which are available in the mounted copy prints and negative series. These prints are with the appropriate description of the building. Less than one quarter of the cards have an accompanying print.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is further divided into four subseries. The first subseries has the card files for New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston. Miscellaneous Philadelphia cards are also found in subseries four. The second subseries has cards on general building types. The third subseries has cards on countries outside the United States, and the fourth has cards on American cities.</field>
