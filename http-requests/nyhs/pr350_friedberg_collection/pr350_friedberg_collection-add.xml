    <field name="abstract_teim">The Friedberg collection largely includes business cards dating from about 1982 to 2017. There are also a substantial number of trade cards and business cards dating from circa late 1800s through the early decades of the twentieth century. These cards cover a wide number of businesses, non-profits, governmental bodies, and educational institutions. The subject matter ranges widely and includes, among many others, restaurants, artists, galleries, antiques, jewelry, books, and clothing. New York City organizations are a significant component of the collection, but the geographic scope is much broader and includes both other parts of the United States and several international areas, perhaps especially western Europe and Asia.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection largely includes business cards dating from about 1982, when Dr. Friedberg began collecting, to 2017, when he and his wife donated the collection to New-York Historical Society. These cards cover a wide number of businesses, non-profits, governmental bodies, and educational institutions. The container list identifies the many subject areas of the cards, which include restaurants, artists, galleries, antiques, jewelry, books, clothing, and much more. Although New York City organizations are a significant component of the collection, the geographic scope is much broader and includes both other parts of the United States and several international areas, perhaps especially western Europe (England, France) and Asia.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the contemporary business cards, the collection holds a substantial number of trade cards and business cards dating from circa late 1800s through the early decades of the twentieth century.  A large pocket of these can be found toward the end of the container list in the "New York City" folder and in portions of the collections not categorized by the collector. But these earlier cards can be found interspersed with the contemporary cards in most of the subject areas. The container list notes the subject areas where at least several trade or other earlier business cards can be found, but it likely does not note them all.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Given the size of the collection and the difficulty of determining dates for the cards, a date range is not included at the folder level in the container list. Generally, researchers can anticipate that the cards in most folders will date from the 1980s-2010s, with some 19th century items, but this could not be ascertained with enough certainty during processing to include at that detailed level.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection holds a small number of items that are not trade or business cards but are other forms of ephemera, such as postcards, bookmarks, or personal cards (e.g., calling cards or a modern equivalent). A few photographs, specifically ten cartes-de-visite and one cabinet card, are in the collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the early 1980s, Dr. Neal M. Friedberg noted that many commercial interests gave away business cards that were beautifully designed with interesting calligraphy, unique pictures or interesting products. He consequently began to collect them. He followed various practices, which evolved over time. Initially, he emphasized that the card include an address, though he eventually relaxed that requirement. He also typically dated the acquisition on the reverse, in part in recognition of the transiency of the business identified on the card. He attempted to acquire the card of succeeding businesses at a particular location, sometimes juxtaposing them in his collection. As the collection grew, he organized much of it into categories he defined. Also, while he collected the majority of the cards directly himself, a small number of other individuals contributed sets of cards tied to particular subject areas. Recognizing the connection between his collection and that of New-York Historical Society's Bella Landauer collection, Dr. Friedberg and his wife, Dorothy, who also acquired cards for the collection, donated it in 2017 to N-YHS.</field>
