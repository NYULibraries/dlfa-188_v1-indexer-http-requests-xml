    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The scrapbook contains some documents from the magazine prospectus, an expanded masthead, and information about the editorial content and operations in 1937. Primarily the scrapbook contains photographs and biographies of Time staff and photographs of the Time offices during regular work days. Examples include "The 'Bull Pen' - Time researchers on a Thursday, before conferences," researchers using "The Morgue" of reference materials, and a photograph of food provided by Time Inc. during a busy period. The scrapbook may contain photographs and biographical information about lesser known staff.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some loose papers, including Sugarman's memorandum, found with the scrapbook are in the Associated Papers folder.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As the scrapbook primarily documents the editorial offices and processes, and seems to have lived in the editorial offices after creation as an editor had it in his possession, it is part of the editorial records instead of the promotional records on the publishing and business side.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">According to a 1963 memorandum from Celia Sugarman accompanying the scrapbook, she acquired it from Marlys Fixx, widow of Time magazine editor Calvin Fixx. Sugarman also recounts her research into the background of the scrapbook concluding it was created by Dan Rochford as instructed by publisher Ralph Ingersoll. She also states that Roy Larsen, who was General Manager of Time Inc. then Time publisher in 1937 after Ingersoll, recollects the scrapbook was created as promotion for Time, but not used since Time Inc. didn't want to divert attention away from its new publication Life.</field>
