    <field name="scopecontent_teim">J. Dana Tasker's files includes the memoranda, correspondence and invoices related to the retention or disposition of Time's cover art. Memoranda from him to Publisher James Linen discuss whether or not original art should go to the subject and the reasons for the decisions. Inventories include reports from the Business Manager James Thomason on covers still in the "bank" for future use with responses from Tasker on which ones to "kill," removing them from storage by returning to the artist or other method. Records also include other interoffice memoranda arranging presentations, correspondence to and from the gift recipients, and framing and shipping invoices.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">J. Dana Tasker handled the retention or disposition of Time's cover art. While Time only acquired the first publication rights for its cover art, it might purchase the original work to gift. Otherwise the artist could sell the original as they wanted. Time frequently sent as a gift, or presented, cover art to the subject or a related interested party or organization as a gesture of good will, for promotion value, or to continue a relationship with a good source. Time executives were less likely to gift if they did not think there was any value to the gesture, did not considered the portrait to be a good likeness, if the art was in multiple pieces and therefore not one original to give, or if the artist wouldn't part with it or had another buyer already. Presenters included cofounder Henry R. Luce, Editorial Vice President Eric Hodgins, Publisher P. I. Prentice, or any other Time employee who had a specific relationship with the recipient. Early cover artists for Time were Boris Artzybasheff, Ernest Hamlin Baker, Boris Chaliapin, and Guy Rowe.</field>
