    <field name="bioghist_teim">The "Hudson Rising" exhibition was installed at New York Historical Society from March 1-August 19, 2019. N-YHS's website described the exhibition as follows:</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">"Hudson Rising explores 200 years of ecological change and environmental activism along 'the most interesting river in America' through artifacts, media, and celebrated Hudson River School paintings. The exhibition reflects on how human activity has impacted the river and, in turn, how the river environment has shaped industrial development, commerce, tourism, and environmental awareness. The exhibition also explores how experts in various fields are currently creating ways to restore and re-engineer areas of the river in response to climate change.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Much more than a body of water, the Hudson and its surroundings have been the home for humans and hundreds of species of fish, birds, and plants; offered an escape for city-dwellers; and witnessed battles over the uses of the river valley and its resources. For over 200 years, writers and artists have captured the river in paintings, drawings, literature, and photographs, and surveyors and scientists have mapped and measured its every parcel."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">A virtual tour of the exhibition is on-line at: https://hudsonrising.nyhistory.org/ </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Several photographs taken by Joseph Squillante appeared in the exhibition. Squillante was born in 1949 in the Bronx borough of New York City. He has photographed the Hudson River for over 40 years. Squillante's stated mission "is to foster an awareness of the river's visual magnificence through photography." His work has been exhibited since the 1980s in both solo and group shows. He has been an advocate for the river, working with groups such as Clearwater, Riverkeeper and Scenic Hudson. In addition to N-YHS, Squillante's photographs are held in the permanent collections of the Museum of the City of New York, the Albany Institute of History and Art, and other institutions.</field>
