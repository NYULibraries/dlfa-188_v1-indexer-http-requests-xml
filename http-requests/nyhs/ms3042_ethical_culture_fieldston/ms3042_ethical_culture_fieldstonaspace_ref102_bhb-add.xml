    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists of reports on administrative and educational issues during the school year at Ethical Cultures Schools. Types of reports vary each year, but nearly all files contain an overall report from the 3-Schools director, along with individual school reports from principals, and sometimes reports from the assistant director, registrar or admissions departments. Many of the reports from the 1930s also have sections written by academic department heads, or reports from the Branch School. Towards the end of the twentieth century, all files begin to include reports from the alumni and development office and the director of admissions and financial aid. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Generally, each principal's report provides a summary of the year's events, departmental issues, new hires, and achievements in teacher and student performance. Reports from directors and assistant directors attempt to confront larger school issues, focusing on budgets, development, faculty and student morale, and facilities. Many reports provide thoughts on ethics issues, parental involvement in the schools, trends in educational theory, technology, and the school's response to larger events and issues, including World War II, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Vietnam War. Occasionally, the administration also makes recommendations or poses questions to the Board. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Earliest reports consist of a lengthy qualitative analysis and personal reflection, with a very small amount of quantitative information (often a college matriculation list). Through the twentieth century, written sections shorten and the amount of quantitative information and data tables increases. 1945 onward, Ethical Culture Schools reports include registration reports with enrollment data. Beginning in the late 1950s, reports of the assistant to the director include a good deal of financial and fundraising information. From the 1960s onward, each year contains a separate report from the registrar's office. Special or ad hoc reports become more common in the second half of the 20th century. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some files include an accompanying letter from the director, and the 1973 report also includes a letter from the Board in response to the director's report. </field>
