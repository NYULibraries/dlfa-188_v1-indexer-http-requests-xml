    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains records of the Ethics program at all grade levels of the Ethical Culture Fieldston Schools. The Ethics curriculum is built on humanistic teachings, with subjects including interpersonal relationships, mental and physical health, current events, history, religion, and moral theory. There is a focus on teaching through examples in myths, folklore, and fiction throughout the program. 

As Educational Director Dr. V.T. Thayer wrote of the program's goals in 1936, "One, that children be led through the school to discover and to develop their unique possibilities of mind and character; and second that their growth should proceed at all times in sensitive response to fundamental aspects of the society in which they live and move and have their being." 

The majority of records were created between 1979 and 1990, during the tenure of Head of School Howard Radest. (Radest also managed the Ethics program in this era, and was involved in the leadership of the Society for Ethical Culture.) It also includes printed copies of stories and texts from throughout the 20th century.</field>
