Subject matter includes development appeals, the management of gifts and funds, school programs, public relations, and strategic planning. 

It contains a small amount of materials from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but the vast majority of records were created after the establishment a dedicated program for fund-raising and publicity in the 1950s. Types of materials include correspondence, reports, meeting materials, press releases, ephemera, and news clippings. Files related to the celebration and publicity of the school's various anniversary celebrations can also be found in this record group. 

Records related to fund-raising for the construction of new buildings, especially Tate Library, can be found in Record Group 10, Buildings and grounds. Administrative and Board of Governors materials in Record Group 1 also often involve development or public relations efforts.</field>
