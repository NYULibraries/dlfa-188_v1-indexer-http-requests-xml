    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes records for early schools and programs that are no longer in existence: the Workingman's School, the Open Air School, and the Summer Play School. (The Branch School was also in operation during this era, but collection does not contain any related records.) These early records mostly consist of ephemera and reports from teachers and principals, along with four scrapbooks compiled by Summer Play School leader Mabel Towne Burnham. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Open Air Department conducted classes on the roof of the Central Park West Building from the 1910s through the 1920s. The Summer Play School was founded in partnership with the New York Federation for Child Study (later the Child Study Association of America) in 1919, providing summer activities and meals for underprivileged children at the Ethical Culture School building on Central Park West. </field>
