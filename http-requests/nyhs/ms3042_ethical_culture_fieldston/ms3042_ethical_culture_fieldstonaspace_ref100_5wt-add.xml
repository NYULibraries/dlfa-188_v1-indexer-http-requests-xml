    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1903-2004</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries primarily contains minutes for meetings of the Board of Governors (later the Board of Trustees), accompanied by meeting agendas, reports from committees, supplementary meeting materials, and related correspondence. Frequent topics of discussion include finances, enrollment, scholarships, collection of tuition, fundraising, faculty and staff, and buildings and grounds.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While most minutes are concerned with strategy or administrative matters, discussions involving the ethics programs and educational philosophy are included. Issues of racial or economic diversity are also discussed, such as in a 1908 declaration of "non-discrimination by color." </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Earlier Board records are more likely to concern individual families or faculty members, or quotidian school business, with discussions moving towards higher level issues throughout the twentieth century. Many files include Executive Committee information (earliest records use the name House Committee). Records from 1981 through 1987 consist of complete mailings sent to Board members. Minutes prior to 1945 are largely facsimiles, not original documents.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Board minutes can also be found in the papers of Chairmen of the Board subseries, or in the Office of the Director series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other than minutes, this subseries contains financial documents related to the Board, and some other miscellaneous Board materials.</field>
