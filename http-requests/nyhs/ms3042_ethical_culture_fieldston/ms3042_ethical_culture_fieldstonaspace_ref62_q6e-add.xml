    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This record group contains materials related to the alumni of Ethical Culture Fieldston Schools. This includes records of the Alumni Association, internal alumni-relations programs, and the Director of Alumni Affairs, as well as materials on the work and lives of former students. Archival materials donated by alumni are also found here.  

Correspondence, meeting materials, news clippings, and ephemera make up most of the record group, along with some photographs and examples of student work. Records date from the 1890s through the 2010s, but the majority of items were created between 1970 and 2010. 

Additional alumni fund-raising and alumni-relations records can be found in Record Group 9, Development and Communications and in files of the administration in Record Group 1.  Copies of alumni directories and other ephemera can be found in Record Group 11, Printed matter. </field>
