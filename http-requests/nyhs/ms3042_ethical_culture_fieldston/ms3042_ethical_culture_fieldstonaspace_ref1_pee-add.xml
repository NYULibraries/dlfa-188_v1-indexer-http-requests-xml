    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This record group primarily contains materials related to the governance and administration of the Ethical Culture Fieldston Schools. Nearly all records were created in the twentieth century, with the bulk created between 1930 and 1999. Most records were created by the Board of Governors or the ECFS administration, and cover topics including finances, staffing, fund-raising, physical plant, technology, social issues, educational theory, and long-term planning. Files for head of school positions (rectors, superintendents, and 3-School directors) are also included. Common types of materials found throughout include meeting minutes, correspondence, and reports. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition, this record group contains information on faculty and staff, as well as student registration data, from all three schools. Principals' annual reports to the Board of Governors also provide information on individual schools. Other materials related to specific schools can be found in their respective record groups. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Generally, development and public relations materials can be found in Record Group 9: Development and Marketing, but some materials in RG1 relate to these efforts. (For example, discussion of publicity in Board of Governors minutes.)</field>
