    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II contains records from the administrative office for fund-raising and publicity from the 1950s through the 1970s. This era saw the establishment of the Ethical Fieldston Fund and the Development Committee, with regular appeals to alumni and parents, and simultaneously, the creation of the Public Relations Working Committee and the publication of the 1954 report, "A Public Relations Program for the Ethical Culture Schools." 

Fund-raising materials include copies of appeals, committee and meeting materials, reports on campaigns and funds, and correspondence. Publicity efforts, often managed by the same staff, are represented in committee materials, correspondence, and a good deal of press releases, which were created frequently in this era. Background materials on various school programs, as well as some general school administrative records can also be found in this record group. 

Related records can be found in Record Group 1, Subseries IV.C., the records of the editorial and publicity assistant to Director Victoria Wagner.</field>
