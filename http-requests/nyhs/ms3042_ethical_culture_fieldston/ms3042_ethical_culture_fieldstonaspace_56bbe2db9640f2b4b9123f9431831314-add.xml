    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This sub-series consists of individual records for Normal Department teacher trainees from the class of 1919 through the class of 1939. Records date from 1919 to 1978, but the majority of records were created during the years students were enrolled in the program, or soon after. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Nearly all files contain an application for admission (often including letters of recommendation or high school transcripts), acceptance letters, observation reports on teaching sessions, and other documents on performance in the program. Many materials, including transcripts and recommendations sent to prospective employers, relate to student job searches after graduation. Many files also contain applications for scholarships, class schedules, verifications of medical examination or vaccination, marriage announcements and invitations, news clippings (mostly regarding marriages), and photographs. Files for the class of 1933 through 1939 include a small photograph of each student; other photographs are noted at the files level.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence topics include admission, performance in program, tuition, requests for references, and events in the lives former students who are keeping in touch with faculty.  
Records for the classes of 1940 and 1941, along with additional records for the class of 1939, are unprocessed.</field>
