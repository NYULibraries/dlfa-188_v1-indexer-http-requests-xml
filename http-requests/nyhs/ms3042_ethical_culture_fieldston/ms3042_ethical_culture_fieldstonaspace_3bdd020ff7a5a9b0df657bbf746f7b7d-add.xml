    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This record group contains materials related to the Society for Ethical Culture, its shared philosophies with the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, and ethics program curriculum. The Society for Ethical Culture was established in 1876 by Felix Adler, who founded the Workingman's School two years later. In 1895, the Society took governance of the newly named Ethical Culture School. Since 1996, the Society and School have been officially separate organizations. 

Based on the Society's teaching, the ethics program was intended to guide students both in their personal lives and their places in the greater world. It was described in 1984 as "based on the personal, social, and intellectual development of our students and responding to the moral issues that they meet in experiences." 

Types of materials include correspondence, reports, ephemera (produced both by the Society and ECFS), legal documents, meeting minutes, teacher guides, and curriculum materials. Records were created throughout the 20th century, but the bulk of materials are dated between the 1970s and 1990s.</field>
