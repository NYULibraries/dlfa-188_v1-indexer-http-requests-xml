    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists of individual files for faculty and staff. For the majority of individuals, materials consist of one folder relating to their employment and work at the Ethical Culture Schools. Nearly all materials in the series were created between 1920 and 1950. (The small amount of items created in the 1970s through the 1990s are mostly obituaries or memorial items for past faculty.) The series is arranged alphabetically by last name.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Files of teachers and principals are most commonly found, but the series also contains several files for psychologists and guidance counselors, librarians, medical staff (especially dieticians and nurses), facilities staff, secretaries, and business managers. Both 3-School staff and staff from individual schools are included. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence, both with and regarding the individual, makes up the bulk of the series. Letters typically discuss administrative matters, classroom issues, contracts, salaries, requests for supplies, and facilities issues. The majority of correspondence is internal to the Schools, along with instances of correspondence with vendors or colleagues at other educational institutions. Many correspondence items concern employment, including inquiries into work at the Ethical Culture Schools, requests by Fieldston for references or other information about a prospective employee, or requests for references by other schools. There are some examples of personal correspondence, such as invitations, or notes keeping in touch with past employees. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other than correspondence, files contain curriculum items, schedules, summer contact information cards, news clippings, ephemera, and classroom materials (syllabi, bibliographies).
Obituaries, memorial service programs and other tribute materials are found throughout. There is some discussion of specific students, before 1950.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The personnel files for some individuals do contain substantive materials about the work of their department. In particular, the folders of Henry Kelly (14 folders, 1902-1939), August Klock (7 folders, 1923-1940) contain a good deal of information about the biology department, including the report "The Science Course at Fieldston," 1930. The following files contain information about each department, mostly during the 1930s and early 1940s: Margaret Koch, history; William Kurtz, physical education and athletic programs; Ethel Murphy, math; Alberta Newton, Greek and Latin. The two files of Arthur Richards contain information on the printing shop in the 1920s. Other departments represented include English, ethics, chemistry, fine arts, French, and German. </field>
