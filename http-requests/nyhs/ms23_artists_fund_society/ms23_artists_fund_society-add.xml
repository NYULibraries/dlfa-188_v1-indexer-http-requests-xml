    <field name="unitdate_inclusive_teim">1859-1937 </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection offers insight into the mission and operation of a New York based mutual aid society for artists. The records span from the Society's founding in 1859 through 1937, a decade before it consolidated with the Society of Illustrators.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records document the organization's structure, decision making, and finances. Meeting minutes, reports, amendments to the constitution, correspondence, resignations, wills, and financial records all demonstrate how the organization operated and changed over time. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Much of the correspondence in the collection describes the conditions of artists in need of help, including struggles with illness, disability, and economic hardship. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sales ledgers documenting  annual art auctions from 1861 to 1889 include artist names, titles of paintings, names of purchasers, and purchase prices. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I of the collection consists of the papers of Alexander C. Morgan, a long time member of the Society who served as president from 1910 through 1933. Series II through X are made up of Society records arranged by type. Morgan's papers were acquired by the New-York Historical Society in 1941; the rest of the materials were donated by the Society of Illustrators in 2008. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, millions of Americans received life insurance and other social welfare benefits through fraternal and mutual aid societies. The Artists' Fund Society was one such society. It was founded on February 5th, 1859, and incorporated on April 13, 1861. The primary mission of the organization was to provide aid to members experiencing disablement, sickness and distress, and to provide assistance to the widows, children and families of deceased members. In 1862 the Society additionally created a benevolent fund to provide aid to artists who were not members.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The original constitution of 1859 simply stated that members were required to be "artists by profession." However, by the 1930s amendments stipulated that members must live in New York City or close enough to attend meetings, and that no person over the age of 45 could become a member.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The organization's leadership consisted of a "Board of Control" comprised of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and five other members. The Board of Control met monthly, and the Society sponsored an Annual Meeting for all members followed by an Annual Dinner for members and friends.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">From 1860 through 1889, members were required to annually contribute a piece of art work to be exhibited and sold at auction. Money from the sales was deposited in a Special Investment Fund. Investments were made on first class bonds and mortgages and stocks of the United States and State of New York. Widows were paid annual interest on a sum of $1500, and then paid a lump sum of $1500 when their youngest child reached age 21. (The sum was raised over the years per amendments to the Constitution.)</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1890, the system of selling art work was replaced with a system of "assessments." The Society required members to pay an assessment fee of $5 within 30 days of the death of a member; the beneficiary of the member received a percentage of the total amount collected.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Records indicate that in 1936 the Board of Control was considering re-organizing or dissolving the Society due to an increase in the number of members unable to pay their assessments, difficulty finding new young members and "a general lack of interest in the society." A decade later, in 1946, the Artists' Fund Society was formally consolidated with the Society of Illustrators, Inc.</field>
