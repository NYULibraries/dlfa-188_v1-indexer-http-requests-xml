    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Consists of autochromes of Wightman's wife and children, and members of his wife's extended family. Most of these images were taken at Lenoir, the Parker family house in upstate New York, and included is an aerial view of the property. They show the Parker women in formal dress posed for the camera in different indoor and outdoor locales. Purl Parker Wightman's aunt, who is frequently pictured, was married to Calet Conley Dula, the president of Liggett &amp; Myers tobacco company. A letter of introduction from Dula to a colleague in China is included with other of Wightman's correspondence in Series 6, Subseries 6, Folder 1. In the photos taken at Lenoir, Wightman's children are small, but they are also pictured as teenagers in the Wightman apartment in New York City. Wightman's father-in-law is shown with his Packard. Two autochromes are cased, as autochromes were supposed to be viewed, and an empty case is also in the collection.</field>
