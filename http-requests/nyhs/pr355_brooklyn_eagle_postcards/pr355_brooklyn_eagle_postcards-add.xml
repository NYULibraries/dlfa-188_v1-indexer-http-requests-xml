    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although they emphasize developed neighborhoods like Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, Clinton Hill, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Park Slope, Prospect Park South, Flatbush, and Coney Island, the Brooklyn Eagle postcards present a dizzying range of subjects scattered throughout the borough. Full card captions are transcribed in the container list, but the images a researcher can expect to find include amusement parks, armories, art museums, athletic clubs, banks, beaches, bridges, cemeteries, charitable institutions, churches (Baptist, Congregationalist, Episcopal, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Reformed, Roman Catholic, Unitarian) and synagogues, colleges and universities, convents, courthouses, department stores, entertainment venues, factories, firehouses, historic houses, horse racing, hospitals, hotels, industrial districts, infrastructure, ironworks, jails, landmarks, learned institutions, libraries, markets, morgues, nursing homes, office buildings, orphanages, parks, police stations, political clubs, public schools, recreational areas, refineries, reformatories, residences, restaurants, roller-skating rinks, shipping, statues and monuments, streets, theaters, transportation, warehouses, waterfronts, and waterworks. A few of the cards depict people: school principals, mainly, and prominent clergymen, and, towards the end of the series, actors appearing in plays at the Montauk Theatre.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Note that the dates in the container list signify when the postcards were issued, NOT when the photographs were taken. In some cases the cards reproduce images that were made at least thirteen to fifteen years earlier than the 1905-1907 period. See, for instance, Souvenir of Our Public Schools (New York: E. J. Whitlock, 1892), the source of many of the images on the Eagle's school building postcards.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beginning the week of 13 November 1905, and continuing through May 1907, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn's leading newspaper, issued a series of remarkable postcards depicting virtually every notable structure and scene in the borough (see the Scope and Contents note for details). The cards were issued in weekly series of six, and offered gratis to paying readers of the paper who clipped daily coupons for each series and exchanged them at the Eagle's offices. Later, in response to demand, and as supplies allowed, the Eagle offered sets for sale. Today they frequently turn up individually in collections and online auctions, but complete sets of all 486 Brooklyn Eagle cards, such as this one assembled by James Olinkiewicz, are rare.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The best introduction to the cards is Richard L. Dutton's Brooklyn: The Brooklyn Daily Eagle Postcards, 1905-1907 (Arcadia Publishing, 2004). </field>
