    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The A. Michael Noll Papers contain documents from 1960 to 2021. These documents were assembled by Noll throughout his career and include many of the papers from his time at Bell Labs and AT&amp;T. There are published works, digital art, research, and correspondence. All papers regarding Noll's Tactile Project are housed in this collection. The collection is 10 linear feet, located on bay 26, shelves 2C, 2D, 3D, 4D, and 3E of the Poly Archives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Noll has donated related materials to other institutions as well. His computer art papers have gone to Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) Fleet. Computer art has gone to Los Angeles County Musuem of Art (LACMA). Some papers are housed at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, and two large prints of his computer art are at the University of Southern California (USC) Fisher Museum. Some of his computer animation is at the Academy of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles and the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York. There is also a small collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">A. Michael Noll was an early pioneer in digital computer art, 3D animation, and telecommunication in the 1960s and 1970s. He received his PhD in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1971.  He was employed by Bell Labs for nearly 15 years, working on basic research and beginning his focus in computer art and telecommunication. In the early 1970s, he was on the staff of the President's Science Advisor at the White House and later worked at AT&amp;T, identifying opportunities for new products and services. He was a Senior Affiliated Research Fellow at the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information at Columbia University's Business School and was a member of the adjunct faculty of the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He is a professor emeritus at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern CaliforniaHe and served as interim dean of USC Annenberg from 1992 to 1994. He has published over ninety professional papers, was granted six patents for his inventions at Bell Labs, and is the author of twelve books on various aspects of communications. </field>

    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Seven boxes were transferred to the Poly Archives from Columbia University in 2021. Additional boxes were donated to the Poly Archives by A. Michael Noll in 2021. Additional miscellaneous items were donated by A. Michael Noll in 2022. The accession number associated with this collection is 21-004.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The University Archivist at Columbia University (Jocelyn Wilk) contacted the Poly Archivist (Lindsay Anderberg) in November 2021 concerning a possible donation of A. Michael Noll's papers.  Seven boxes of Noll's papers had been housed at the Columbia Business School with Professor of Finance, Dr. Eli Noam.  As the Business School prepared for a move, they contacted Columbia Univeristy Archives about the collection.  The collection was not a fit for Columbia, but seemed more appropriate for the Poly Archives, as Noll had recieved his PhD from Brooklyn Poly.  The collection was described as "subject files on various telecommunication technologies that were emerging in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s which ultimately became the ubiquitous technologies we are using today...It's a mix of reports, internal memos, publications and presentations. Very well organized by topic and in good condition. Among the technologies documented are "video text" "picture phone" and "CATV"."  The Poly Archives accepted the donated and the transfer of the seven boxes occurred on December 7, 2021.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Following the transfer of the boxes from Columbia, Dr. Noll sent additional boxes of material from his personal collection to the Poly Archives in late 2021 and early 2022.</field>
