    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the early 1950s Tobias was commisioned by the university to create a mural called the History of Science, in addition to two plexiglass mural panels. The commissioned pieces were mean to celebrate scientific advancements made by university members, and those throughout the entire history of science. The two plexiglass murals were completed on schedule, but the History of Science mural was never completed, and remained a source of turmoil for Tobias and the university.
