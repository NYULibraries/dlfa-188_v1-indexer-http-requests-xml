    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Faculty Minutes contain both meeting minutes and other associated documents from faculty meetings.  The minutes span from 1896 to the present and are available as bound items, binders, and loose paper documents.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Faculty Minutes collection begins in 1896 in bound volumes.  Over the years, the minutes were no longer bound, but were placed in three ring binders.  The most recent faculty minutes and associated documents are foldered and boxed immediately after the meeting.  Faculty meeting minutes from 2003 to present are also available online, although they are password protected so that only faculty members may view them.  </field>
