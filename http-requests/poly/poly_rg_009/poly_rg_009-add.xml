    <field name="bioghist_teim">Pamela Kramer began her long career at Poly in 1972 as a Psychology instructor, two years after completing her Masters in Education and Developmental Psychology at Tufts University.  After earning her PhD in Psycholinguistics in 1973, Kramer was promoted to an Assistant Professorship position in 1974.  Over the course of her career at Polytechnic, Kramer also served the Director of Women's Programs (1981- 1985) and as Department Chair of Social Sciences (1985- 1990).  Kramer also planned, executed, directed, and evaluated numerous grant funded activities and programs focusing on women and minorities in the science and engineering fields, including the Careers in Research for Minority Scholars program, funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense Office of Naval Research, reentry programs for women in polymer sciences and other engineering fields, and the Gateway Program at Polytechnic University.  In 1991 Kramer earned the position of Assistant Provost for Freshman Studies and was promoted to full professor in 1996.  She died in Brooklyn on February 18, 1999.</field>
