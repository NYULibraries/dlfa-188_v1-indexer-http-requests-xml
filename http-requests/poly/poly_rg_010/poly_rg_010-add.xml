    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists primarily of lecture notes, homework problems, and lab experiments from classes taught by Canavaciol from the mid-1930s through the 1950s.  During his time at Polytechnic, Canavaciol also submitted and reviewed questions for the Professional Engineer Licensing Exam and his sample questions, answers, original test booklets, and records of his involvement from 1947- 1962 are also present.   The collection also contains related literature from Canavaciol's library, primarily reprints, brochures, and manuals from companies such as AT&amp;T, RCA, and General Electric, though there are also some larger volumes, including a course book from an extension course offered by Westinghouse.  Lastly, wire samples from the Sensitive Research Instruments Corporation are also included.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Frank E. Canavaciol was an instructor of electrical engineering at Polytechnic from 1916 until 1966.  He taught a variety of classes in the Electrical Engineering Department, ranging from entry-level 401 and 402 classes to upper level classes.  During his time at Polytechnic, he also co-authored a book on the topic of Radio Phone Receiving in 1922, and was an active participant in the Professional Engineering Licensing Exams, helping to both write and review electrical engineering questions. He died in Queens in May of 1987, at the age of 91.</field>
