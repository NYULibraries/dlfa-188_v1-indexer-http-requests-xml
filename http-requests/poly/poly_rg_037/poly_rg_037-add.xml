Contents include: correspondence with other professionals and colleagues; photographs of Morawetz and colleagues; invitations and documentation of events and awards ceremonies attended by or honoring Morawetz; Morawetz's personal writing including an unpublished autobiography and a travel diary detailing a visit to Prague in 1979; personal correspondence, media coverage and public facing material related to the 1978 boycott of the International Symposium on Macromolecular Chemistry in Tashkent, Uzbekistan (then USSR); administrative documents regarding Morawetz's employment at the Polymer Research Institute; and copies of published articles and books by Morawetz or owned by him, in English and multiple foreign languages.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Herbert Morawetz (b.1915-d.2017) was a Brooklyn-based polymer chemist and professor specializing in the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to study local conformational transitions and polymer compatibility. After fleeing his home country of Czechoslovakia with his family following German occupation in 1939, Morawetz settled in Canada, earning Bachelor's (1943) and Master's (1945) degrees in Chemical Engineering from the University of Toronto and a PhD (1950) in Chemistry from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (later becoming the Tandon School of Engineering at NYU in 2014). In 1951, he joined the faculty at Poly where he would spend the duration of his career, becoming the director of the Polymer Research Institute in 1971.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">He published two major books: "Macromolecules in Solution," in 1965 and "Polymers: The Origins and Growth of a Science" in 1985. In 1986, Morawetz received the American Chemical Society Award in Polymer Chemistry and following his retirement from teaching, spent fifteen years as the editor of the scholarly journal "Macromolecules". He was the husband of prominent mathematician Cathleen Synge Morawetz. Herbert Morawetz passed away in November 2017, a few weeks after his 102nd birthday. </field>
