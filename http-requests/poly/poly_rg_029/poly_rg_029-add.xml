    <field name="abstract_teim">Henry Jasik (1919-1977) was a prominent scientist in the field of antenna engineering.  After completing his doctoral studies in Electrical Engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1953, he went on to found his own company, Jasik Laboratories, Inc.  Jasik maintained his ties to Polytechnic, working closely with the Microwave Research Institute throughout his career.  His Antenna Engineering Handbook, first published in 1961, is still widely referenced today.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains binders, albums, and notebooks relating to Jasik's antenna research.  These items contain a variety of material types, including published articles (by Jasik and colleagues), lab reports, photographs, notes, and correspondence.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains biographical information about Jasik, his connection to Polytechnic's Microwave Research Institute, and memoranda detailing the donation of Jasik's library to the Polytechnic Institute of New York.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Henry Jasik (1919-1977) received a BS in Electrical Engineering from Newark College of Engineering in 1938, a Master of Electrical Engineering from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1951 and a Doctor of Electrical Engineering from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1953.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After he graduated from Newark College of Engineering, Jasik worked for the Navy and the Civil Aeronautics Administration, assisting with radio aids to air navigation and airborne radar and communications antennas.  After some time as an independent consultant and completing his graduate work at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Jasik founded Jasik Laboratories, Inc. in 1955.  His company focused on the design, manufacture, and testing of various antenna types.  Jasik was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers in 1958 for his contributions to "the theory and design of VHP and microwave antennas."  Jasik's Antenna Engineering Handbook was first published in 1961 and is still wildly referenced today.</field>
