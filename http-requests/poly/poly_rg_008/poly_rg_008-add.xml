    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Leonard Shaw Papers includes departmental records, memorandum, and correspondence concerning the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department from 1973 through 1999.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents the merger with NYU in 1973 and some of the effects on the EE/CS Department and students, primarily in regards to confusion surrounding graduation requirements.  This collection also contains records from the departmental decision to eventually phase-out the evening course offerings for the BS in EE program in 1989.  Also included in the collection are records of the planning, implementation, and assessment of joint EE degree programs offered in cooperation with both Reiss-Romoli in Italy in the early 1990s and the School of Television and Cinema in Tehran, Iran in the late 1970s. Lastly, the collection contains records of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Traineeship from 1993 through 1999.</field>
