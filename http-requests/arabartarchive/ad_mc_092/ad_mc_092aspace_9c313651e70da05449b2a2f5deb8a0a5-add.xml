    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Handwritten and hand-illustrated diaries by Rafa Nasiri, created within bound journals and sketchbooks throughout his life, spanning 1976 to 2013. These feature sketches alongside observations of daily life, activities, and art events he attended. The almost daily entries were not separate from the art and ideas that were translated as drawings in the same cherished notebooks. They offer insight into the inner worlds of the artist, including his experiences of travels and war events. Nasiri recorded details about meetings with fellow artists and intellectuals in Baghdad, Asilah, Irbid, Amman, Beirut, and in Italy, Spain, the UAE, and other countries, students and teachers he worked with at Yarmouk University and the University of Bahrain, the routes he commuted on, his feelings towards personal and professional engagements, sketches of artifacts he saw in collections, his opinions on the quality of the lectures he attended and their audiences, and more.</field>
