    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes personal photographs for May Muzaffar and Rafa Nasiri from their childhood and adulthood years until Rafa Nasiri's late years when he was a cancer patient, as well as professional photographs covering Baghdad's social and artistic milieu from the 1960s to the 1990s. The collections show the couple's different houses in Baghdad, including meetings and gatherings at each one of them, interiors at the Institute of Fine Arts, trips made with friends around Iraq, meals and events with friends and guests, travel to Morocco, Germany, Portugal, and other countries, and Nasiri's Graphic Studio. During the Iran-Iraq War, Nasiri's Graphic Studio, known as Al Muhtaraf, was actively printing works for Nasiri and his fellow artists while also presenting exhibitions, keeping the art scene in Baghdad alive despite the grimness of war. Additional photos pertain to Nasiri and Muzaffar's years of exile in Amman and Manama from 1991 to 2013.</field>
