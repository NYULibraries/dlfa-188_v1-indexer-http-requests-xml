    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The NYU Abu Dhabi Student Life Events: Photos, Music, and Videos collection is a collection of digital images, as well as some music and video files, from a variety of student and campus events during Academic Years 2014 - 2020. The collection was maintained, organized and transferred to the University Archives by Student Affairs Facilities Manager, Declan Dowdall. Dowdall also transferred files he inherited from his predecessor, Alex Heald. Some administrative documents, such as brochures and event request forms, were included in the transfer and have been retained. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Events that are documented range from student field trips, to campus festivals, to other campus events such as Autism Awareness Week, Latino Night, Marhaba, Pakistani Mock Wedding, Staff Appreciation Day, and Defend the Nest, among others. Many of these events were, and some still are, understood as "campus traditions" during the institution's first decade. </field>
