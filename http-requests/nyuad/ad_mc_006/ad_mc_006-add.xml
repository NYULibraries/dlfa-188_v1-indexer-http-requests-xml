    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains DVD copies of films screened at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival from its first festival in 2007 to the final one in 2014.  The films represented in the collection come from the different competitions, showcases, and presentations from each of the versions of the festival; the national, regional, and international films are both documentary and fiction (narrative) in both short and feature length. The collection is made up of works that were made for submission to the festival, or were screened at many film festivals that year, as well as older films that were presented as part of showcases and retrospectives. Along with the films, the collection contains ephemera and publications (guides, brochures) from the festival.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Abu Dhabi Film Festival began in 2007 as the Middle East International Film Festival, rebranding itself in 2009. Since its inception, the festival's mission has been to foster a "vibrant film culture throughout the region."  As part of this aim, ADFF worked to curate "exceptional international programmes to engage and educate the local community, inspire young filmmakers from the region and nurture the growth of the regional film industry."  The annual event incorporated a variety of programs into the festival, including film screenings and competitions, galas, talks, workshops, and master classes.  As represented by the films in this collection, the festival was international in nature. Many of the films though come from local or regional filmmakers (UAE and GCC) who competed in the festival's Emirates Film Competition. A portion of those filmmakers are amateur, part-time, or novice filmmakers. The festival was closed down after the 2014 iteration, with support for local and regional filmmakers continuing through the Sanad Abu Dhabi Film Fund.</field>
