    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Woodman Taylor collection consists of printed material related to art exhibitions, art organizations, and related activities, in the United Arab Emirates, collected by educator and art historian Woodman Taylor.  The collection includes exhibition catalogs, exhibition guides and maps, brochures, and issues of serial publications.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the material in this collection was acquired by Taylor while he lived and worked in the United Arab Emirates from 2012-2020.  While not meant to be a comprhensive collection, it nevertheless provides a glimpse of the vibrant arts scene during that time, as experienced by Taylor through exhibitions at museums and galleries, and other arts-related events that he attended.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Representation is particularly strong for exhibitions hosted by the Sharjah Arts Foundation, but also includes materials from other arts organizations based in Sharjah, such as the Maraya Art Centre and Barjeel Foundation.  Also represented are several galleries from Dubai's Alserkal Avenue, along with other events and venues in Dubai.  In addition, a few venues in Abu Dhabi are included as well, including the NYU Abu Dhabi Art Gallery and Zayed University.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the exhibition catalogs, booklets, and maps are bilingual, printed in both Arabic and English.</field>
