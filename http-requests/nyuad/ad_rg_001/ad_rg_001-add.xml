    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Early planning documents, publications, ephemera,  and other promotional and commemorative materials produced and distributed on the occasion of the establishment of NYU Abu Dhabi, brought together into an artificial "early collection" by the archivist, as the provenance/donation information for these materials was not recorded. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection includes ephemeral items such as a copy of the first speech delivered to the Class of 2014 by then Dean of Students Jim Larrimore, early issues of the first iteration of an NYUAD student newspaper, "The Fishbowl," and ephemera from Candidate weekend.  Also included is a small folder of architects' annotated meeting notes and printed records, including oversize copies of draft floor plan designs from June, July and August 2010. Of note is a specially designed commemorative book (published summer 2008), produced on the occasion of the establishment of NYU Abu Dhabi. Two volumes are published together into one book: "An Evolving Global Dynamic," and "A Partnership for the Future."(two copies). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Over time, as additional records have been transferred to the University Archives from various offices of leadership, many of the records and publications in this collection are also available and preserved in other Record Group collections, including the Hilary Ballon Papers; Records of the Office of Dean of Students; Records of the Office of Student Life, NYU Abu Dhabi Publications and Ephemera, and others. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection may be added to in the future, but most subsequent collections will be organized as part of the donating office.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Established in partnership with New York University and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, NYU Abu Dhabi is the first comprehensive liberal arts and science campus in the Middle East to be operated abroad by a major American research university. Founded upon "a shared understanding of the essential roles and challenges of higher education in the 21st century," the project was announced in 2007, and in 2010 NYU Abu Dhabi welcomed its inaugural class. </field>
