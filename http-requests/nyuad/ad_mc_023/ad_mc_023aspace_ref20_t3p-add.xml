    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Video-recorded session with Yousif Asfour, former Chief Information Officer then Associate Vice President for Strategic Initiatives, by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Yousif Asfour, who began his journey with NYU Abu Dhabi as Chief Information Officer, talks about his role in getting the University off the ground in its early stages. He discusses extensively the interface between NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU in New York - the assuredness of building off their model and the challenges of modifying that model to the Abu Dhabi context, for example with networking, which is more difficult and expensive in the UAE. He also mentions the challenges of working two shifts, one in the morning with the Abu Dhabi team, then at night with his New York contacts. Yousif talks about the obstacles with the establishment of the campus which included problems with contractors, setting up the IT infrastructure and negotiating with the government with regard to academic freedom. The IT system was the main focus of his responsibilities including the recruitment of staff, and setting up operations at the Downtown Campus and the new Saadiyat Campus. </field>
