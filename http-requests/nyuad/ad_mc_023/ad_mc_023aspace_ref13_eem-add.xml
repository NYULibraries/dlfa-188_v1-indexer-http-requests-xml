    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Yannick Trapman-O'Brien reflects on his time at NYU Abu Dhabi in his final semester. He speaks about the tension involved in his decision to attend the university instead of his dream school, Candidate Weekend being the event to sway his choice. The adjustments to a new city and lifestyle are important to him, especially experiencing the growing pains of the new university which often involved poor facilities like plumbing and dining. He mentions his complicated relationship with the city and the UAE as a whole because of the weather, differing perspectives on labour issues and volunteering, as well as the fast pace of growth. He says that moments of connection including community open mic events, thanksgiving celebrations and dancing in the rain were able to ease his difficult experience at the university. </field>
