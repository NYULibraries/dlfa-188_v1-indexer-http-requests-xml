    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Video-recorded session with Tamu Al-Islam, former Director of Human Resources Services, Strategy and Engagement, by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Tamu Al-Islam describes her journey from the administration of NYU, in New York, to NYUAD, as the latter was conceptualised. Her introduction to NYU's initial interest in Abu Dhabi was through the Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Scholars Program which she helped to bring to its current level of prestige. Tamu talks of the early days of the institution when the support within the team was integral to maintaining focus and camaraderie, as well as beginning to understand and experience the city. Points of contention among the team included dealing with the lack of infrastructure, becoming acquainted with local practices different to one's own and the relationship between NYU and the Abu Dhabi campus. Tamu also refers extensively to the growth of NYU Abu Dhabi from what she calls a startup to its stage in 2014, moving to the Downtown Campus, the interaction of students and faculty, growing school population and substantial academic preparation which has contributed to the continued development of the school.</field>
