    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Video-recorded session with Brett Hegeer, former NYUAD Program Coordinator and Special Assistant to the Provost; and Nils Lewis, NYUAD Program Coordinator then Manager of Faculty and Student Programs for the NYUAD Institute. Conducted by Ilka Datig, Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library, as well as Tamu Al Islam, Director of Human Resources Services, Strategy and Engagement.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Nils and Brett describe their journey in the coordination of NYU Abu Dhabi as recent graduates and younger members of the team. They describe work on important projects like the Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Scholars Program and the NYUAD Institute. The former gave them an opportunity to meet leaders in the political field and engage with Emirati students. For the Institute, they recall conducting extensive outreach to the community which was done manually throughout the city of Abu Dhabi at beaches and other locations.  They also mention the importance of a connected Arab diaspora and Arab networks to sustaining the relationship between the Institute and the community. Many other instances also required a very hands-on approach on their part whether that was writing welcome cards for visitors or setting up the stage for a particular event. The pair also played the role of hosts to many groups and individuals who visited the institution as part of the recruitment process or for other programs. They discuss the adventures of learning to live in Abu Dhabi, experiencing the environment, local culture, religion and locating necessary spaces such as laundromats and supermarkets.</field>
