    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Video-recorded session with Emily Eagen, NYU Abu Dhabi Class of 2014 senior student at the time of the interview, by Ilka Datig, former Reference and Research Librarian, NYUAD Library. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Emily Eagen shares her story of applying to New York University Abu Dhabi and her Candidate Weekend experience. She shares a number of anecdotes related to her first days on campus, such as being afraid of leaving the Sama Tower residence, even to do grocery shopping, or feeling nervous about meeting her roommate, who was from a different personal and religious background. Emily recounts her first few weeks on campus filled with excitement and social events but also feeling stressed and homesick later in the first semester. She shares her positive first impressions of the city and reflects on the difficulties she faced in Abu Dhabi, mainly the dress code and the uncomfortable feeling caused by people's stares. Emily shares her experience of starting an informal Christian group on campus and participating in interreligious dialogues, which later grew to become the Interfaith Committee at NYUAD. She shares her concerns with the competitiveness of the University and the mental health of the students, especially with the suicidal inclinations among the student body. She then reflects on the Facebook arguments as being emblematic of the contemporary NYUAD, shares her experiences of participating in the RealAD Show and welcoming the freshman students to the community. </field>
