This body of material from the Institute's first decade will be of interest to anyone researching the early years of NYU Abu Dhabi as a way to understand the University's regional and global role in advancing research and scholarship, and exchanging knowledge collaboratively with the wider public. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials include printed calendars; promotional cards, flyers, and brochures; a small collection of printed photographic materials; published "Year in Review" yearbooks; and audiovisual files (photos, videos, slide presentations) from over 300 events sponsored by the Institute from 2007-2015. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series "Calendars, Promotional Materials, and Program Brochures" is a collection of printed materials that were displayed, distributed and mailed as invitations, covering the years 2008-2014. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The small series "Photographic Materials" separates out some of the printed photographs and contact sheets from early events (although, users should note that the majority of event photos have been preserved as part of the audiovisual series). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A full set of published yearbooks, the Institute's annually published "Year in Review," offers highlights and overviews of each year's programming.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Finally, this collection's audiovisual series offers not only a detailed inventory of what the collection contains as far as photographed and video-recorded events, but also information about associated program officers and speakers, as well as external links to online published clips and videos for selected events, hosted on the Institute's YouTube channel.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">New York University, in developing a new "Global Network" of degree granting campuses and academic centers across six continents (NYU New York, NYU Abu Dhabi, and NYU Shanghai), established the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute in 2008, two years prior to the Abu Dhabi campus opening its doors to its first class of students and faculty. The Institute was the first "on-the-ground" operation of the University in the UAE.  As a research outreach and sponsorship component, it was established to create and support innovative research programs, organize public discussions with experts from around the world, and invite participation not only from and for the NYU network constituency but also from and for local, regional, and national communities. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Institute's inaugural program in October 2008, "On the Art of the Novel,"  featured renowned Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury. Its "first collaboration" came during the November 2008 program "Stephen Hawking's 'A Briefer History of Time'," featuring the Arabic translation of that book by Kalima, the translation initiative launched by Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage (ADACH). In December of 2008, "Neurolinguistics and Imaging: Progress and Prospects" was the first multi-day program that the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute sponsored. Early events took place at the Al Mamoura Auditorium in Abu Dhabi. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">NYU Abu Dhabi Institute programming was early-on a joint effort between faculty and administration in Abu Dhabi, and faculty and administrative leadership in New York. The Institute created an Advisory Committee that also first convened in Decmeber 2008, and in May of 2009, the NYUAD offices at 19 Washington Square North sponsored the first New York-hosted Institute event, a lecture titled "Building Big: A Critical Examination of the Planning of Mega Urban Transportation." The Institute continues to organize programs in both Abu Dhabi and New York. When the NYU Abu Dhabi downtown campus was built and finally available as a venue for programs, the Institute hosted its first on-campus lecture there in December 2009, "The Predictioneer's Game," a talk about game theory with NYU Professor Bruce Bueno de Mesquita. Student-centered Institute programming was introduced in 2011 with the "Hackathon for Social Good in the Arab World." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Today, the NYUAD Institute continues to sponsor and support multi-day conferences, workshops and seminars relevant to the NYUAD curriculum and areas of research, across a range of subjects from falconry to poetry to genomics to youth unemployment crises.  The Institute has become an important asset of the university that seeks to deepen understanding of the world, generate important new knowledge, and facilitate breakthrough discoveries in science and technology.</field>
