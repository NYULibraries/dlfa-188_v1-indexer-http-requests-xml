    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Note about this publication, from AY19-20 StuGov President Hafsa Ahmed: In 2018, students were surveyed about their NYUAD experience, including why being an NYUAD student matters, and other questions about their memories and community experiences. Over 450 students responded. From those responses, a student editorial team (who chose to include their initials in final publication) curated the responses along with original illustrations into a book, with a limited print run. From Hafsa Ahmed: "The intent was to preserve, however much possible, the unique values and characteristics of the NYUAD community amidst its rapid change and transitions, for future generations of students. The first distribution of the book took place in Fall 2019 whereby a copy was dropped off outside each first year student's dorm. In Spring 2020, during NYUAD's 10th anniversary, a wider distribution took place among the rest of the student population. This is not something that has been done before and we don't anticipate this to repeat again simply because that will go against the purpose of having one foundational values book for all generations of students to come. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"A little more about this book - the Shibboleth (that's what we've named it) is extremely student-facing and non-administrative in nature i.e. its themes, production, and distribution have all happened without direct official involvement from any office/institution on this campus (save for Public Affairs who helped manage vendors and VC's office who generously funded this). The value in this values book is that it's largely of and for the student body. At this point we don't anticipate it to be distributed on a large scale to the wider community (save for some individual staff/faculty/admin who are extremely student-facing and drive community-building on our campus). Of course, this may change over the next few years as new students take the charge of handling the Shibboleth (we have internal transition systems in place) but I wanted to share the original intent with [University Archives], especially because I feel strongly that any archiving process should be accompanied by the vision/intent of what it is that's being archived."</field>
