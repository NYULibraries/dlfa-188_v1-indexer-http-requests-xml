    <field name="abstract_teim">Computer Advocacy at NYU (C@NYU) was a student organization, originally formed to advocate for computer services and information about computing for students.  The group's members represented a wide spectrum of New York University community members, including staff, faculty, administrators, and students. The records consist of correspondence, administrative forms, financial records, flyers and pamphlets, newspaper clippings, and computer-related reference material.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of correspondence, administrative forms, financial records, flyers and pamphlets, newspaper clippings, and computer-related reference material. The collection covers a wide range of topics related to workplace safety and computer awareness. Evident throughout these records are the strong collaborative relationships fostered between C@NYU and other student organizations and local computer-related groups, such as: The Internet Society of New York, NYU Information Technology Services, The Womyn's Center, Students for a Free Tibet, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Club, and the Amiga User Group. Their cooperation led to numerous conferences and special events that focused on specific issues; for example: emerging software programs and internet technologies, computer-related injuries and acquired disorders, and the social impact of the World Wide Web. The collection is particularly signficant because it allows the researcher to acquire a comprehensive view of a student organization's activity for its entire lifespan. It reaches all areas of its administration, from event planning to promotion, and from budgeting to networking with influential people and groups. In an even broader scope, the C@NYU Records demonstrate the organization's crucial position in raising computer awareness throughout the New York University community.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Approximately 1.25 linear feet of material were eliminated from the collection during its processing, primarily due to excessive amounts of multiple copies. Overall, the paper is in good condition. Gaps in the records appear in two notable areas: the absense of RSI Day 2005 and the decreasing amount of material in C@NYU's later years. There was no RSI conference held in 2005 due to personal conflicts. Membership began to dwindle in the last few years of C@NYU's existence, resulting from a spectrum of factors, including graduation and the willingness or ability of students to keep the group active.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Computer Advocacy at NYU (C@NYU) was a student organization, originally formed to advocate for computer services and information about computing for students.  The group's members represented a wide spectrum of New York University community members, including staff, faculty, administrators, and students.  Its student members focused on a variety of academic majors, from computer science to the sciences, medicine, history, literature, cross-disciplinary arts and humanities, business adminstration, and law.  Any individual who had an interest in computers and their uses was welcomed, and determined efforts to reach the entire New York area were consistently displayed.  In addition, all skill levels and fields of study were represented amongst the group's members.  These were not only technical skills, but end-use purposes as well, applicable within multiple academic fields.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Throughout its existence, C@NYU worked closely with New York University's Academic Computing Facility and later with Information Technology Services to address computer concerns across campus.  These activities include the cosponsoring of events, such as Computer Awareness Week, and inviting representatives from ACF and ITS to speak at C@NYU conferences.  Several events were also cosponsored with other New York University student groups, such as The Center for Students with Disabilities, The Womyn's Center, Students for a Free Tibet, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Club, and the Amiga User Group.  Contact with numerous New York City non-profit organizations was also firmly established, particularly with the Internet Society of New York (ISOC).  C@NYU hosted many of ISOC's panel discussions and workshops, all of which were open to the public.  Their programs included technical, social, political, educational, and hands-on how to guides, namely through a very successful weekly cource called "Unix by e-mail," with 104 participants from the New York University community.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">For a time, articles were composed regularly by C@NYU's members for both the Washington Square News and the ACF/ITS magazine publication.  These contributions were made to publicize the organization's activities and to spread awareness about more general computer-related issues.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to a discourse on emerging computer technologies, there was a strong health and safety component amongst the group's interests.  Workshops were held on safe computing, ergonomics, computer injury education, treatment and prevention.  Beginning in the year 2000, C@NYU sponsored an annual event for Repetitive Strain Injury Day, featuring panel discussions on timely issues.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In its final years, C@NYU membership waned due to several factors. Many of the members were graduating, while others were unable or unwilling to keep the group active. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The C@NYU records are a meaningful addition to the University Archives because the group was active in many influential computer-related discussions and awareness efforts in the New York University community during its 13-year life span.  </field>
