    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Washington Square News has been captured since 2013. There is a gap in capture of the website from 2016-2017. The website provides daily news to readers around NYU's Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses, Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Heights, and NYU's global campuses. The website offers news, culture, arts, editorial, sports coverage, photos and videos from around campus and New York City, in conjunction with the magazine, Under the Arch. In September 2020, the staff resigned from the newspaper. New articles were not added to the website until the Spring 2021 semester.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The crawls also include a capture of While You Were Here 2020, an annual magazine directed to seniors recapping their four years at NYU.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Crawl was limited to domains and subdomains of nyunews.com in order to remain within the collection scope and data constraints. Facebook was blocked. Website was rescoped to attempt to capture issuu publications linked to the website.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content. Full-Text searches of archived websites are available at https://archive-it.org/organizations/567.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Issuu publications are currently not playable in Wayback. </field>
