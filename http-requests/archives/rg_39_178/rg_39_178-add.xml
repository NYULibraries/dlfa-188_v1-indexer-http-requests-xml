    <field name="bioghist_teim">New York University has had many student newspapers with many different names since its founding. The Heights campus and the Washington Square campus had separate student newspapers until 1973 when the Heights campus was closed. The Washington Square News was first published in the fall of 1973, and was preceded by the Washington Square Journal.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Originally titled the Washington Square Daily News, the newspaper shortened its title in the fall of 1974 and continues to be distributed/circulated.</field>
