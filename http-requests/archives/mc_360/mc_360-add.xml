    <field name="abstract_teim">Beryl Cobham was born in Panama and came to the United States around the year 1920. Cobham paid for her college tuition herself, and graduated from the New York University School of Education in 1940. After graduation Cobham entered the social work field and later worked for the Board of Education. The Beryl Cobham Collection on New York University consists of materials created and collected by Cobham documenting her experiences as an undergraduate student at NYU in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Materials include a 1940 School of Education yearbook from Cobham's senior year, a book inscribed to her from a classmate (given after graduation), an NYU sweater, a transcript and notes on Cobham's graduate school coursework at City College, a photograph of a friend, and pages of a scrapbook with black-and-white photographs of Cobham and her college friends (many of whom are Black students) in various locations, including Bear Mountain and Washington Square Park.</field>
