    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Vice Chancellor's and Chancellor's files include correspondence describing MacCracken's selection of vice chancellor and the proposed selection of his son John H. MacCracken as his successor, miscellaneous correspondence, and annual reports. There is very limited documentation concerning the activities of John MacCracken as syndic or acting chancellor of New York University.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The University College material includes information about the classics, English and geology departments, and the chemical and physical laboratories. These files contain correspondence from faculty members, including Ernest G. Sihler, professor of Classics, Archibald Bouton, professor of English and later dean of University College, Morris Loeb of the chemical laboratory, and Daniel W. Hering, professor of Physics. The classics department file also includes two articles by Sihler. The geology department file describes the search for a successor to John J. Stevenson. Examination questions pertain to various departments. Material in all folders is arranged in chronological order.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The professional schools files contain material about the Graduate School (Graduate Seminary), Law School, School of Applied Science (Engineering), University Medical College (University and Bellevue Medical College), the New York American Veterinary College, the School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance, and the School of Pedagogy. Correspondence, reports and printed material comprises the documents found for most schools. In 1899, the chemical and physical laboratories became part of the School of Applied Science. Material for the two laboratories before and after 1899, however, is found in the University College folders of the collection. Letters from applicants for faculty positions in the School of Pedagogy are arranged in alphabetical order; material in all other folders is arranged chronologically.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Graduate School (Graduate Seminary) records consist of correspondence and reports, some of which are from John D. Prince, dean of the school, 1895-1902. Theological studies material includes an 1890 agreement between N.Y.U. and the Union Theological Seminary.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Law School files include correspondence from Austin Abbott and Clarence D. Ashley, deans of the schools, 1891-1896 and 1896-1916 respectively. There is limited information about the Women's Law Class and no material on the Metropolis Law School.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The School of Applied Sciences (Engineering) records include correspondence and reports from Charles H. Snow, dean of the school, 1899-1930, dating from as early as 1892.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The University Medical College files contain information about the merger between the University Medical College and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1898, the subsequent Loomis Laboratory lawsuit, and the proposed affiliation with the New York Homeopathic College. Correspondence from Egbert LeFevre, dean of the school, 1898-1914, and Herman M. Biggs; financial records and printed material also are included in these files. The financial records describe the physical facilities of the school and include correspondence with Andrew Carnegie about the Carnegie Laboratory.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance records consist of correspondence of Charles W. Haskins, first dean of the school 1900-1903, and partner in the accounting firm of Haskins and Sells. Many of the documents, including faculty correspondence, financial information, course descriptions, printed material, and newspaper clippings, pertain to the establishment of the school.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The School of Pedagogy material provides information about the 1901 controversy over admissions standards which led to mass faculty resignations. In addition, some documents describe MacCracken's role as acting dean from 1901 to 1904. There is virtually no information about the Summer School.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Women's Advisory Committee material relates primarily to the operation of the School of Pedagogy, including information about the 1901 controversy, faculty appointments, courses, and finances. Minute books covering the period 1890 to 1911 provide much information about the committee's activities.</field>
