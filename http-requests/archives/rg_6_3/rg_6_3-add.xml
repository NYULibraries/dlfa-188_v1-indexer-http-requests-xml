    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists primarily of reports on NYU's degree programs, faculty, scholarship programs, applicants, facilities, financial aid and administrative policies published between 1959 and 1975. Preliminary reports and summaries are also included. It contains some correspondence and supplementary material such as memos, newsletters and brochures that pertain to reports or studies in the collection. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are several reports on student progress in the Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholarship Program, started in 1969, as well as reports on students who declined the offer of admission to NYU  or left to attend other schools. Attention is also given to transfer students and foreign students. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Office of Institutional Research and Planning also conducted surveys and studies of faculty morale on topics including university policies, procedures, salary and students.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">NYU's Office of Institutional Research and Planning (sometimes referred to as The Office of Institutional Research and Educational Planning) was created in Spring 1953 as the office responsible for carrying out the University's self-study. The office was under the supervision of the University's Executive Vice Chancellor, who headed the office for the first few months before Associate Dean of the School of Law Miguel de Capriles was appointed director.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1961 NYU's Board of Trustees approved the merger of the Office of Institutional Research and Planning with the Office of the Coordinator of Research Services to create the Office of Research Services, under the umbrella of the Academic Affairs Office. It is unclear exactly when the transition of authority over this office occurred. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1971 the Office of Research Services became the Office of Sponsored Programs. That year the Academic Affairs Office also changed names, becoming the Office of Academic Development. These offices retain these names at this writing. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Factbook is managed by the Office of Institutional Research and Data Integrity, which aims to "guide the university's academic, administrative and operational units for effective university planning and progress through analysis, consistent information dissemination, decision support and technical data expertise." The office is part of NYU's Human Resources' Administrative Services.</field>
