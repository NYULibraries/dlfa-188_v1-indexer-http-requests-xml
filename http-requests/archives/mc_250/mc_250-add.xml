    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Faculty of Arts and Science Department of Music Student Composition Recordings and Concert Ephemera consists of 147 audiovisual recordings of new music compositions by graduate and undergraduate students of the Music Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS). Audio recordings of performances, rehearsals, and studio sessions constitute the vast majority of the collection's materials, though it also contains four video recordings of interviews with visiting composer Elliott Carter.
One folder of print and manuscript ephemera accompanies the audio recordings in the form of annotated and unannotated performance programs and notes, posters, and concert announcements. An inventory spreadsheet of the recordings is also included.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Music Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science was established in 1923. Upon the dissolution of the University Heights campus in 1972, the Washington Square College and University College programs were merged into one department at Washington Square.
The M.A. track in Composition was added to the Department in 1989, with the first degree awarded in 1991. The following year saw the establishment of the Ph.D. program in Composition and Theory.
As part of the composition track, the Department of Music sponsors concerts to showcase student composers' works. Outside groups, including the International Contemporary Ensemble, the League of Composers/ISCM, and the American Brass Quintet, have been hired to perform at many of these events, while some are sponsored directly by First Performance, an NYU graduate student composers' collective.</field>
