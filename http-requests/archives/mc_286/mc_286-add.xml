    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Prior to 2018, websites were initially selected by curators and captured through the use of the Internet Archive's Archive-It service. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2019, accessioning information for archived websites were recorded. Websites were added either due to content drift, link rot, or were selected by the University Archivist. The accession numbers associated with these websites are 2019.090, 2019.091, 2019.092, 2019.098, 2019.099, 2019.100, 2019.101, 2019.102, 2019.103, 2019.104, 2019.105, 2019.117, 2019.127, 2019.129, 2019.132, 2020.003, 2020.010, 2020.022, 2020.024, 2020. 026, 2020.028, 2020.031, 2021.010, 2021.013, 2021.018, 2021.023, 2021.024, 2021.025, 2021.026, 2021.027, 2021.028, 2021.029, 2021.030, 2021.031, 2021.032, 2021.034, 2021.035. 2022 archived website accessions are 2022.013, 2022.015, 2022.016, 2022.017, 2022.055, 2022.089, and 2022.090. 2023 archived website accessions are 2023.013, 2023.031, 2023.054, and 2023.056. 2024 archived website accessions are 2024.017 and 2024.026.</field>
