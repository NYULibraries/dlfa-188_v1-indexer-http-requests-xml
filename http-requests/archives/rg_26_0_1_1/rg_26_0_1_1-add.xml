    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Records of the Office of the Associate Dean of the School of Education spans 1962 to 1970, with most materials falling between 1967 and 1969. It is divided into three series: Series I: Departmental Administrative &amp; Budgetary Memoranda; Series II: General Administrative Records; Series III: School of Education Publications. Series I is arranged alphabetically by department and consists of general correspondence and requests for funding for various projects between department heads and faculty and the Office of the Associate Dean as represented by either Dr. Elliot Mininberg (Director of Administrative Services and Assistant to the Associate Dean) or Associate Dean Kleinman himself. Series II contains a lot of general memoranda including a good deal from the Department of Administration and Supervision. Also included are copies of form letters and requests (both paid and unpaid) for budget allocations for food services and flyer/leaflet/pamphlet publication. Series III contains more correspondence dealing specifically with School of Education publications as well as copies of many of the publications themselves, primarily from 1968 and 1969.</field>
