    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The administration series consists of 20 linear inches of material organized alphabetically by subject. Within each folder the material is organized chronologically. The series relates to general administrative activities and academic matters, including office services, research, libraries, legal matters, university history, the Hall of Fame, the art collection, and program development.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Box 21 consists primarily of information regarding alumni and announcements and circulars from the President's office. In the original inventory, alumni affairs was a separate series and included all New York University alumni activities, associations, and correspondence with or regarding an individual alumnus. Because this information consisted of only two folders, it has been incorporated into the administration series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Box 22 contains materials of considerable interest to researchers. Folders 4-7 include information about the disagreement between President Hester and Parks Commissioner Robert Moses over whether or not the Hall of Fame would be moved after NYU abandoned the Heights campus. Folder 8 contains information about the history of NYU and the Washington Square area in general, including a report on NYU's budget from 1849. Box 22, folder 9 and Box 23, folder 1 contain information about the establishment of the NYU Archives and its early history.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Box 23, folders 2-11 and Box 4, folder 1-3 contain information about NYU's legal difficulties with professors and students. Folder 11 includes information on NYU professors who protested denial of tenure.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Box 24, folder 5 contains information about the debate over NYU's purchase of a nuclear reactor and a community protest on the matter. There is also additional information about NYU's participation in the United States Bicentennial celebration. Material on this subject also exists separately in the University Archives (MC 144). The minutes regarding the bicentennial have been removed from this collection and stored with the other material.</field>
