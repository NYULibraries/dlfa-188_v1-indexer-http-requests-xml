    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of one scrapbook from the years 1931-1941. Most of the clippings found in the scrapbook include sporting event tickets, programs, exam papers and invitations to various NYU events. Many of the clippings are annotated by Kaye, giving insight to all the activities that he was involved with. Miscellaneous pages were also included in the collection. These pages were once a part of the original scrapbook but had been misplaced. They were sent to the Archives shortly after Kaye discovered that they were missing. The collection also includes additional items that Kaye sent over, such as Alumni Bulletins about himself and other post-graduate events that he attended.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ira S. Kaye was born on March 21, 1921, in New York City. He was a 1941 graduate of New York University and was a student at the University Heights campus from 1937-1941. Kaye was enrolled in the College of Arts and Pure Science and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting. While at NYU he was the feature editor of the student newspaper, the Heights Daily News. Many of the clippings in this scrapbook are articles that he wrote while working at the Heights Daily News.  He was also the editor-in-chief of the Heights' 1941 Violet, the campus yearbook, and associate editor of the 1940 Violet.  Kaye was involved in Quaigh and the Rifle and Pistol Club and was a member of several committees, including the Lawrence House Committee, the Freshman Camp Executive Staff, the Ducking Committee, the Fordham Rally Committee, the Mall Committee, and the Senior Ball and Junior Prom Committees. In addition to these, he was also a member of Perstare et Praestare, the Gilbert and Sullivan Society and the Hamilton Commerce Society. As a graduate of the R.O.T.C. program at NYU, Kaye was enlisted as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was stationed in Camp Edwards, Massachusetts, in 1942. In 1952, Kaye was elected second vice president for the South Florida chapter of the Alumni Association.  In 1953, Kaye was promoted to assistant comptroller of the National Silver Company.</field>
