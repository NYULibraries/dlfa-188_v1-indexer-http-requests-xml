    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of correspondence; manuscripts; case histories and records; organizational materials, including Youth Consultation Service, Children's Village, World Federation of Mental Health, American Mental Health Foundation, and Brooklyn State Hospital; video and sound recordings; awards and certificates; notebooks; book reviews; clippings; and notes from approximately 1905 through 1978. Materials document Slavson's career and offer an interesting look into the early days of group psychotherapy in New York City. There is considerable material on the Group Therapy Department of the Jewish Board of Guardians, psychotherapy in social service agencies, founding of the American Group Psychotherapy Association, as well as personal biographical materials. Among the collection were the papers of William Weinstone, founder of the Communist Party of the United States of America. Some of the early writings found in Series II may have been created by Weinstone and not Slavson.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection has been divided into seven series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: Correspondence and Biographical Material, 1917-1978, includes: general correspondence to and from Slavson from 1930-1978. The correspondence concerns books and papers written by Slavson, letters to editors, requests for information from social service agencies from around the world and letters to and from family members and friends. Also included are invitations to lecture, lecture schedules and biographical material, including: newspaper and magazine clippings and speeches from his retirement dinner at the Jewish Board of Guardians.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Published and Unpublished Manuscripts, 1900s-1970s. Slavson wrote approximately 200 articles and 16 books. This series includes published and unpublished manuscripts, some typed and others handwritten. Since most of the material was not dated, it is arranged alphabetically by title or topic (when no title was available). A great many (possibly) unpublished and undated material is present, including early writings consisting of poetry, novels, essays and short stories. The series begins with several folders of numbered articles which were intended to be published together in one volume. Boxes 6 and 7 contain journals and books, in English and other languages.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III: Group Treatment Records and Case Histories, 1927-1963. This series deals with treatment records and case histories and is closed to researchers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV-VII contain reprints of articles, clippings, photographs and audio and video recordings (unprocessed).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">S.R. Slavson was a psychologist, teacher, writer, poet and labor activist born in the Ukraine on December 25, 1890. Slavson arrived in New York at age 13 after his family's escape from the pogroms in Russia. While struggling to support himself, Slavson sought to educate himself. In the process, he acquired an interest in poetry and literature, as well as a proclivity for science. After reading Rousseau's Emile, he began to embrace the ideals of socialism, and became a member of the Socialist Party in 1904. These political leanings brought him to the labor movement where he was instrumental in the formation of the Ladies Garment Workers Union.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Slavson attended evening school at the Cooper Union and graduated with a B.S. in Engineering. Subsequently, he studied briefly at Columbia Teachers College. After a number of positions in education, he gradually became immersed in the study of child psychology, which, coupled with his interest in social justice, led to Slavson's emergence as a pivotal figure in modern psychology and psychoanalysis. In 1934 Slavson was made director of Group Therapy at the Jewish Board of Guardians where he served until retiring in 1956. Besides his ceaseless work at developing innovative ways to deal with the psychological issues of urban youth, Slavson consulted frequently with numerous other mental health facilities during his tenure. From 1956-1968, he continued his work and shaped new theories on the treatment of delinquent adolescents and institutionalized psychotics. Until his death in 1981, he wrote prolifically, often lectured, and was frequently honored by his peers and colleagues. </field>
