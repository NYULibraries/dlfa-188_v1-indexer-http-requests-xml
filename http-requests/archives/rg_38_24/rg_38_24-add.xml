    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection contains the records of the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department. The mission of the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Department is to preserve, protect and thereby extend the usable life of the NYU Libraries' collections. The materials concern a variety of preservation and conservation initiatives, including specific grant projects, as well as work involving bindery operations, deacidification programs, preservation microfilming and photocopying projects, preservation supplies, audio/visual preservation, digitization projects, photograph and music research collections, and conservation training.  These projects also include efforts to conserve materials held by NYU special repositories.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains the records of the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department from the period 1990-1996, as well as conservation documentation from the period 2004-2009.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials concern a variety of preservation and conservation initiatives, including specific grant projects, as well as work involving bindery operations, deacidification programs, preservation microfilming and photocopying projects, and preservation supplies.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Specific preservation projects encompass efforts related to map preservation, student newspapers, a preservation video entitled "Murder in the Stacks," acetate audio recordings, digitization projects, photograph preservation, music research collections, and conservation training.  These projects include coordinated programs with other institutions such as Columbia, Cornell and Syracuse Universities, as well as efforts to conserve materials held by NYU special repositories such as Tamiment Library, the Wagner Labor Archives, and Fales Library.  The records also document preservation efforts related to the New-York Historical Society library.  A significant amount of material deals with the Research Libraries Group (RLG) Great Collections Microfilming Projects (GCMP).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of correspondence, grant applications, annual reports, quality control records, meeting records, statistical questionnaires, budgets, expenditure reports, invoices and other financial records.  Funding documentation relates primarily to New York State aid, as well as National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) awards.  Conference materials cover meetings of the American Library Association (ALA), New York State preservation meetings, and meetings of the Eleven Comprehensive Research Libraries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In accordance with the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) code of ethics, conservation documentation is maintained in order to establish the condition and aid in the care of cultural property.  Conservation documentation relates to treatment of items in the NYU Bobst Special Collections (The Fales Library &amp; Special Collections; Tamiment Library &amp; Wagner Archives; University Archives), the Stephen Chan Library Collection (Institute of Fine Arts), the Ehrman Medical Archives, and the Courant Institute Library.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Conservation documentation consists of logbooks used to track the movement of collection materials in and out of the lab, as well as reports of examination and treatment of items.  Some treatment reports include images of the item before, during and after treatment. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The mission of the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Department is to preserve, protect and thereby extend the usable life of the NYU Libraries' collections. The department pursues this objective in accordance with the mission and goals of the Libraries, and in conjunction with the University's research mission. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Preservation Department is responsible for the following activities: commercial binding, conservation treatment, reformatting, disaster preparedness, staff and patron education, and a program to monitor climate control in the Library. In addition, department include programs for moving image and sound preservation, as well as digital conversion. The conservation treatments used in the conservation lab include rebinding, recasing, rebacking, boxing, deacidification, paper cleaning, washing and, mending, as well as other minor repair work in order to preserve collections for current and future scholars.  Conservation treatments preserve the physical object through professionally accepted treatments that prolong the life of the materials. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Reformatting techniques are used for books and archive materials that cannot be physically repaired because the paper is too brittle to sustain conservation treatment. These techniques include preservation microfilming and preservation photocopying. In addition, special grant-funded preservation projects are conducted on an ongoing basis within the department to preserve damaged and deteriorating non-book materials, such as, photographs, music scores and audio/visual materials. Moving image and sound preservation are designed to provide collections care, such as proper housing, and reformatting for these rapidly deteriorating collections. The department also administers digital conversion projects that include a preservation component. </field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">This collection was transferred to the University Archives from the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation and Conservation Department. The conservation documention for the years 2004-2009 was transferred to the University Archives from the Conservation Lab in December 2011. An accretion was donated by Lou Di Gennaro in 2019, the accession number associated with this transfer is 2019.096. A further accretion of born-digital files were transferred by Laura McCann in March 2022; the accession number associated with this transfer is 2022.011.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Advance notice is required for the use of computer records. An access terminal for born-digital materials in the collection is available by appointment for reading room viewing and listening only. Researchers may view an item's original container and/or carrier, but the physical carriers themselves are not available for use because of preservation concerns.</field>
