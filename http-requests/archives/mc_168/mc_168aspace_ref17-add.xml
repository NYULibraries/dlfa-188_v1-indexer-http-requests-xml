    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Nixon Tape Materials consist of 3 linear feet of material documenting Brademas' involvement in presidential records legislation beginning in September 1974 in response to the "Nixon-Sampson" agreement revealed by the White House. This agreement between former President Richard Nixon and Arthur Sampson, the Administrator of General Services Administration, granted Nixon control over his presidential materials and included provisions for the destruction of the materials. As chair of the Subcommittee on Printing of the House Administration, Brademas became the chief House sponsor of legislation leading to the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, which nullified the Nixon-Sampson agreement and established the National Study Commission on Records and Documents of Federal Officials to study the status of records created by the President and other elected and appointed federal officials and make recommendations to Congress. This series documents the development of that legislation as well as the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which declared that Presidents could no longer claim title to their papers.</field>
