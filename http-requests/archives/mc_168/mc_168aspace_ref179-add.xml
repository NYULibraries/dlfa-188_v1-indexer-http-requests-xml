    <field name="scopecontent_teim">During the summer of 1974, Turkish troops employing American weapons and materials invaded Cyprus, an independent island nation off the coast of Turkey with a majority-Greek, minority-Turkish population. This series documents Brademas' involvement in the legislative response to the invasion, the subsequent arms embargo against Turkey, and its removal in 1978. There are 8 linear feet of records dating from 1966 to 1980 (bulk 1974-1980).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials include drafts of bills; committee prints; press releases; letters and telegrams from lobbyists, agencies, organizations, and businesses; drafts and final copies of standard reply (robo) letters in response to constituent mail; news clippings reporting on all aspects of the Turkish invasion and arms embargo; colleague mail; meeting summaries; speeches; and staff memos and reports. Files are arranged alphabetically by subject.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Brademas received copious amounts of information regarding the Cyprus situation from sources including the Embassy of Greece, Embassy of Cyprus, the United Nations, personal friends including John Koumoulides and Costa Carras, and various organizations (including the American Hellenic Institute, American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, United Hellenic Council, Save Cyprus Council, and the Hellenic American League). Correspondence, clippings and reports from these sources can be found throughout the series, generally filed by name of correspondent.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Memos composed by Brademas and his staff provide valuable insight into the politics behind U.S. foreign policy involving Cyprus, Turkey, and Greece. These memos report conversations with other government officials, detail events of meetings, and strategize for the passage and opposition of legislation. The documents are found throughout the series, but see especially folders "Aid to Turkey," "Briefing Material," "Cut-Off Amendments," "Dear Colleague Letters," "Discussion Points," "Floor Fight," and "Turkish Defense Cooperative Agreement."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The "Aid to Turkey" files and "Discussion Points" files provide the most comprehensive overview of Brademas' involvement in the Cyprus situation. Most major issues involved with the legislation are addressed in these folders through staff memos, newsclippings, and various reports and statements. Insights into the political struggle between embargo supporters in Congress and the policies of the Ford and Carter Administrations can also be found in these files. Additional information about the legislation is filed separately under more specific titles (e.g., "Arms Export Control Act," "Cut-Off Amendments," "Turkish Defense Cooperative Agreement").</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries also contains materials related to public opinion in America, Greece, and Cyprus through constituent letters (see "Cyprus Correspondence," "Greek Correspondence," "Personal Correspondence: Greek Matters" and "Personal Correspondence: Greek Trip"); press (see "Greek Press Reaction â€“ Trip" and "Newspaper Clippings"); and Greek-American organizations (see "Andy Athens Material," "Community," and "Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committee".</field>
