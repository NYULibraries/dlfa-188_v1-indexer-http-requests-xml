    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists of 26 linear feet of correspondence from constituents, as well as lobbyists, agencies, organizations, and businesses, and responses to these letters. Most letters express constituent views on various bills and amendments, as well as their reactions to international, national, and regional affairs. Prominent issues include the energy crisis, social security and pension reform, childcare legislation, union and labor legislation, the Vietnam War, President Nixon and the Watergate scandal, abortion, education legislation, congressional reform and congressional pay raises, and gun control. A smaller portion of the series includes automated letters sent to other members of Congress, as well as automated letters directed to campaign donors, volunteers, and election candidates. Additionally, there are constituent mail surveys, described as "legislative mail surveys," "robo mail surveys," or "reports and tapes," which not only list the issues, but the number of response letters sent out per month. These surveys exist for 1973, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, and 1979.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials include correspondence, notes, records of phone conversations, and a limited amount of reference material (articles, reports, pamphlets, etc.). Files are arranged chronologically by year, then alphabetically by subject.</field>
