    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries, consisting of 8 linear feet of material, reflects Brademas' participation in the Democratic Leadership of the House of Representatives, beginning in 1967 when he was appointed a regional assistant Whip. In 1971 he and John McFall shared duties as co-Majority Floor Whips and in 1973 Brademas became Chief Deputy Majority Whip. From 1977 to 1980, Brademas served as Majority Whip. Materials are arranged chronologically by Congressional Session, then alphabetically by subject.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Files in the 91st and 92nd Congresses contain materials related to the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970. Brademas participated in the bipartisan group that supported the development of amendments to the legislation aimed at eliminating secrecy in the legislative process and democratizing and modernizing House procedures.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For information about Brademas' appointment and role as Chief Deputy Whip, discussions of potential roles for him in the party leadership, and analysis of debates over making the Whip position elective instead of appointive, consult folders in the 93rd Congress including the "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee," "Democratic Steering &amp; Policy Committee" (see especially memo dictated by Brademas describing the events leading to his appointment as Chief Deputy Whip) and "Whip Appointment" as well as folders in the 94th Congress including "Democratic Caucus" and "Leadership."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Additional materials address Brademas' role in the Democratic Caucus and Democratic Steering &amp; Policy Committee, including his chairmanship of the Task Force on Information and other assignments; major legislation and democratic policy initiatives (see folders in the 93rd Congress on '"Budget Committee" and "Impoundment" or the 95th Congress on "Railroad Strike"); as well as some information regarding Brademas' committee memberships (see "93rd Congress Gorewitz, Rubin L." and "95th Congress Education").</field>
