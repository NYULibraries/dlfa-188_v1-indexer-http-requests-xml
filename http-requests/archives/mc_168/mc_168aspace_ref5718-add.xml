    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains 13 linear feet of campaign files of Brademas and his staff. After two unsuccessful campaigns in 1954 and 1956, Brademas took office in 1958, unseating Republican Jay F. Nimtz. Files begin with the 1956 campaign and are arranged chronologically by campaign year, then alphabetically by subject.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each election generally contains information on the administration of the campaign (see folders on "Accounting," "Declaration of Candidacy," "Budget and Expenses," "Volunteers," "Voter Registration"); fundraising efforts and events (see folders on "Banquet," "Fundraising," "Contributions"); and campaign strategy (see folders on "Analysis," "Planning," "Polls," "Opponents," "Issues"). Also included for most years are clippings files with items from local newspapers about Brademas' campaigns as well as his opponents and colleagues. For information on Brademas' campaign-related television and radio appearances, see folders on "Television and Radio" as well as the Audiovisual subseries in the Media Series. Additionally, there are four scrapbooks covering elections from 1964 to 1976. Scrapbooks include photographs, newspaper clippings, correspondence, press releases, brochures, and campaign materials.</field>
