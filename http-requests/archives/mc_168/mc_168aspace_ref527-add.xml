    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Brademas served as chairman of this subcommittee from 1969 to 1979. There is 5 linear feet of material dating from 1968 to 1980. Materials include constituent correspondence, interoffice memoranda, subcommittee memoranda, hearing testimony, transcripts, opening statements and summaries, committee prints, committee reports, conference materials, floor statements, clippings, background reports and other materials on specific legislation considered by the subcommittee.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries documents Brademas' efforts to create child development legislation. In 1969, he began drafting legislation and in cooperation with Senator Walter Mondale (D-Minn.) conducted hearings over the next three years. See "Comprehensive Child Development Act" folders for materials regarding the initial Comprehensive Child Development Act, including copies of the bill, comparisons with other bills, and analysis of the bill. "Child and Family Services: Clippings" contains additional material on the bill, including general background articles and numerous articles about the legislation authored by Brademas. Brademas and Mondale's subsequent attempts to pass child development legislation are documented in the "Child &amp; Family Services" folders. Attacks on this bill by the media are well documented in the files, including a flyer that sparked controversy over the bill (see "Child &amp; Family Services: Print" for a copy of the flyer and "Child &amp; Family Services: Rebuttal" for Brademas' point-by-point rebuttal).</field>
