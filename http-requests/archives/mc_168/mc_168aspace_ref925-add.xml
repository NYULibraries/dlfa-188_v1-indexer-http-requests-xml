    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This group of files includes documents from Brademas' assignments to subcommittees and groups related to higher education â€“ the Advisory Group on Higher Education, Special Subcommittee on Education, and Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education. Materials measure 2.5 linear feet and span the length of Brademas' tenure in Congress (1959-1980). Brademas served as chairman of the Advisory Group on Education in 1961 and 1962. He was a member of the Special Subcommittee on Education from 1966 to 1974 and the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education from 1975 to 1980.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Only one folder documents the Advisory Group. It contains correspondence with universities, memoranda, and notes by Brademas related to the group's mandate to identify unmet needs in higher education.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Two folders relate specifically to the Special Subcommittee on Education. "Office of Education Hearings" contains questions and answers for the hearings, statements of witnesses, some background material, and other material related to the study of the U.S. Office of Education. "Student Unrest Hearings" contains Brademas' floor speech, memos, newspaper editorials and clippings regarding student disorder legislation (H.R. 11941).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Folders on Higher Education consist of material from both subcommittees documenting amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 during the 92nd, 94th, and 96th sessions of Congress. Materials related to the Higher Education amendments are filed under the Congressional session (e.g. 92nd Congress, 94th Congress) as well as by specific issue (e.g. Higher Education: Guaranteed Student Loans) or bill number (e.g. Higher Education: H.R. 3471). "Higher Education: Memos" and "Higher Education: Memo Book" contain detailed memos from Administrative Assistant Jim Mooney and Brademas that discuss major provisions of the amendments as well as some of the negotiations and politics involved in its development.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Additional folders relate to the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education. Topics covered include the reauthorization of the National Foundation of the Arts and Humanities Act, the Museum Services Act and the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act.</field>
