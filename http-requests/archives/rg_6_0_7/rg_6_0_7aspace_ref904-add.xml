    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series of 1.66 linear feet reflects a universe of external organizations concerned with higher education matters, both on the national and on the local scene, and memberships held and declined by the University. This series' contents offer insights into the University's interests and roles in that wider world. A set of Higher Education and National Affairs newsletters, 3/74-2/76, 3/77-4/77, published by the American Council on Education (ACE), provides an overview of the national context in which the higher education community was then functioning.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Material contained in Box 19, folder 1, makes manifest that limitations on extramural involvements that might otherwise have been welcome were driven by internal financial concerns, with oversight of unit and school decisions at the executive level. Matters concerned with the University and its accreditation agency, the Middle States Association of Colleges &amp; Secondary Schools, Commission on Higher Education, are located in Box 20, folders 7-8, including the Middle States Association Report on its visit to the University 11/18-21/73.</field>
