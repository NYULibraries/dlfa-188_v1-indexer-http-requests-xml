    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series of 2.5 linear feet is something of an alphabetical, and topical, smorgasbord, beginning with Academic Change, Box 47, folder 1, and finishing with Women's Studies, Box 52, folder 26. It represents in the main a collection whose organizing principle might be characterized as "Is There Anything Here for Us?" Material is commonly in the form of newspaper, journal and news service clippings. Much of the content was identified in, or in the case of reports, prepared in the office of the Vice President for Academic Planning and Services.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">One interesting assemblage, Box 49, folders 11-18, is material enabling the tracking of the development and outcomes of a University Goals Conference convened by Dr. Hester and titled "New York University 1981." The concluding "Goals Statement," discussed and amended by the University Senate, 10/31/75, is located in Box 49, folder 11. It reflects upon the decade the University emerged from in 1974 and projects its ambitions and goals for the decade ahead. By contrast, a copy of a "Report for the Decade Ahead 1964-1973," by Dr. Hester, found in Box 49, folder 18, projects forward from the pre-crisis vantage point of 1964.</field>
