    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These files, as noted previously, both are alphabetical and contain the Borowitz and accompanying Cartter Correspondence files as a subseries, Boxes 13 through 18. The series, largest of the collection, comprising 7.5 linear feet, offers what may be regarded as an overview of the Borowitz years. Some material is complementary to larger accumulations within subsequent series'. This will readily be observed in reviewing contents of Legislative Relations, Box 7, folder 11 through Box 8, folder 8, Federal Relations, Box 6, folders 812 in conjunction with those classified as Government Relations, Box 40, folder 11 through Box 46, folder 14. Contrarily, other material stands alone. Some examples are the folders labeled Appointment, Chancellor Borowitz, Box 3, folder 1 through Chancellor's Office, Administrative Advisory Committee, Box 3, folder 11, and Library, Box 8, folder 4 through Box 9, folder 9.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Box 1 incorporates material relating to general academic and administrative matters. One notable instance is the topic of deans' review of vice presidential areas, folder 6. Box 2 contains Cartter testimony, 3/29/71, before the U.S. House of Representatives Education and Labor Subcommittee, sounding the alarm on the extent of financial difficulties within the higher education community, folder 12. Box 3 includes a copy of a report titled, "Effecting Economies in Higher Education," 8/73, addressing higher education's financial difficulties through the medium of case studies of New York University and Michigan State University (MSU), conducted by a MSU presidential staff member, folder 12.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> In Box 6, folder 4, there is a memorandum from Vice-President for Academic Planning and Services L. Jay Oliva to President Sawhill, 2/27/76, presenting a set of critical issues for institutional attention. Borowitz correspondence, Box 13, folder 16, contains views on the loss of the School of Engineering, and the effect of "past adversities" on (the University's) "destinies;" in Box 14, he addresses merger negotiations, folder 10, and relations with City College, folder 13.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other contents reflect Borowitz responsibility vis a vis the President's Office, other officers, schools and departments, and assorted initiatives under central administration purview. Box 17 offers some indication of the Borowitz personality and style, while Box 18, folders 1-7 provides a miscellany indicative of his working relationships with Dr. Hester and Dr. Sawhill.</field>
