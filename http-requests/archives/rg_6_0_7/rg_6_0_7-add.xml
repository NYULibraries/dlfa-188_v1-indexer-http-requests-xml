    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These papers of Sidney Borowitz reflect the years he served as Chancellor/Executive Vice President of the University, 1972-1977. They include as well a small portion of papers formed during the Chancellorship of Allan M. Cartter, in particular Correspondence files created during the period beginning April 1971 and overlapping with Borowitz Correspondence files of May 1972. Additionally, the contents of one Paige box transferred to the University Archives in 1997 from the Office of Sponsored Programs were entered into this collection, augmenting material found in the Chancellor's files on the University Science Development Program initially funded at the University by the National Science Foundation in 1969.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection is composed of correspondence, memoranda, newspaper clippings, press releases, publications, and reports. As second in command, and deputy for the President in his absence, material was directed to Dr. Borowitz from throughout the University in connection with central administration decision-making and oversight requirements and responsibilities.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In consultation with the University Archivist, and in an effort to keep congruence between the Hester Papers (RG 3.0.7) and this collection, the Borowitz and previously noted Cartter Correspondence files were grouped as a subseries to the Borowitz Administration Series (Series 1), an alphabetical series combining elements comparable with Hester Series 1 (Alphabetical) and 2 (Administration). The remaining files were grouped into eleven categories (series), with most of the titles also found in the Hester Papers, in the following order: Associations; Development; Facilities and Services; Finances, incorporating Subseries I, Taskforce on the Financial Emergency, and Subseries II, University Heights Campus Disposition; Governance; Government Relations; Institutional Advancement; Personnel; Public Relations; Schools and Divisions; and Student Affairs. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The placement of like material does sometimes vary between series in the Hester and Borowitz papers. One instance is the location of documents concerned with the University's relationships with the New York State Department of Education; in the Hester papers these items are in the main found within the Governance Series, and in the Borowitz papers, in the Government Relations Series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is some overlap between content in Series 1 and the subsequent series'. Folder titles throughout reflect date and broad content subject matter. The impact of the aforementioned elements may occasionally be to slow the process of locating particular materials. Within limits, an attempt has been made mitigate this effect by providing cross-references where appropriate through notations on Separation Sheets filed preceding folder contents. Material is organized chronologically in folders, with a green plastic clip placed on the right margin of material highlighted in this Finding Aid.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As previously noted, and in some other instances as well, files were moved to bolster content clarity and consistency. About 8 inches of material of miscellaneous subject matter were found in folders labeled "Abeyance," the latter seemingly randomly packed into Paige boxes where there was space, in preparation for deposit in the Archives. These items were transferred to existing folders on the basis of subject. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Significant accumulations of materials concerned with matters already the subject of separately existing collections within the University Archives were removed and transferred to those collections, including Humanities Council materials (to RG 9.5.1), James Arthur Collection documents to the James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches (RG 42.1), Faculty Unionization effort (to Mss Collection RG 14 B1), and Jewish Culture Foundation materials (to RG 12.11).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A description of each of the Borowitz Papers series', with contents germane to major themes highlighted, precedes the Box and Folder list for that series.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">At the time in the University's history that this collection was initiated, the Office of the Chancellor/Executive Vice President (C/EVP) held institutional responsibility as head of the faculty, sponsor of faculty appointment, termination and tenure, and chief liaison between faculty and students and the Board of Trustees. (1) Second in command to the President, the C/EVP exercised oversight over the schools and divisions as well as most internal organizational problems, with deans and officers reporting directly to him. (2)</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Under President James M. Hester's leadership, the University by 1964 had embarked on an ambitious development plan to improve its facilities, raise its standards for admission, and increase its visibility within its urban community. (3) By the end of that decade, student protest, enrollment declines, and inflationary pressures were derailing those plans. It had become a time of financial difficulty for institutions of higher education throughout the country. (4) Recurrent and serious financial difficulties at New York University placed the continued existence of individual units at risk, and even threatened the future of the institution itself. When Sidney Borowitz became Chancellor in 1972, the University, regarded as the country's largest private institution, had been experiencing multi-million dollar annual losses. (5)</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dr. Borowitz, named acting Provost in 1971 of New York University's (NYU) University Heights campus in the Bronx, site of the University College of Arts and Science and the School of Engineering and Science, was appointed C/EVP May 1, 1972 by President Hester, 1962-1975, to succeed Allan M. Cartter, Chancellor 1966-1972. When, three years into Chancellor Borowitz' incumbency, President Hester stepped down, the Board of Trustees, after a national search, selected John C. Sawhill, 1975-1980, as the University's next president. During the early years of his time in office Dr. Sawhill seemingly concluded that he preferred "to operate without a Chancellor..." (6); Dr. Borowitz stepped down in 1977.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Temporary relief to the University's deficit in the early 1970's came with the sale brokered by the New York State Education Department (NYSED), of the University's Bronx campus, 1894-1973, to the City University of New York for use by Bronx Community College. Concurrent with discussions with officials in Albany concerning the future of the University Heights campus, President Hester convened a Taskforce on the Financial Emergency to address other questions related to the University's on-going fiscal problems; one member was the then Dean of University College Sidney Borowitz, Box 30, folder 5.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Under the terms of the final agreement with NYSED the University's School of Engineering and Science and its faculty were merged September 1, 1973 with the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (PIB), and transferred to Brooklyn, effectively ending the University's long-term role in engineering education, 1854-1973. In a related move University College of Arts and Science and its faculty was merged with the Washington Square College of Arts and Science at Washington Square.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By the beginning of 1975 the University again faced major financial problems largely attributed to extreme national recession/inflation pressures, Box 4, folder 4. While Drs. Hester and Borowitz moved quickly to convene available members of the 1972 Task Force on the Financial Emergency, to review the University's current and projected deficit situation and recommend solutions, Box 2, folder 5, Dr. Hester's departure in effect transferred the initiative for resolution of these problems to his successor.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Also within its academic precincts, during this period the University experienced a faculty unionization drive, took some initial steps toward closing down its School of Social Work and then reversed itself, shut down its PhD program in Philosophy (FAS), not to be reinstated until the 1990s, considered closing the College of Dentistry or entering into a contract relationship with NYSED for its operation and support before its financial stability was assured through new understandings reached with NYSED, and created the Gallatin Division, expanded successor to the University School Without Walls program first recognized in 1972, and precursor of its current Gallatin School of Individualized Study, in tandem with a reorganization of the School of Continuing Education.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Among other institutional initiatives in that time, NYU established its initial policy and office responsible for Affirmative Action, broadened its governance machinery, undertook a major review of its mission and direction through a presidentially convened Goals Conference, and developed its Office of Student Affairs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dr. Borowitz was a member of the NYU physics faculty and taught at both the Bronx and Washington Square campuses. His wide acquaintance among faculty and administration at these university centers allowed him to consult broadly while maintaining the objectivity required by his role as a senior player in the resolution of situations demanding difficult decisions at the University and school levels.</field>
