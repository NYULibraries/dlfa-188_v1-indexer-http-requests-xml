    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of the Edwin Berry Burgum Academic Freedom Case contain administrative and faculty materials assembled between 1952 and 1961. The bulk of the material falls between the years 1952 and 1953, the period of Burgum's suspension and dismissal following his refusal to answer questions before the McCarran Committee of the United States Senate. The contents of the Burgum records consist primarily of administrative and council minutes; bound transcripts of the legal hearings between Burgum and New York University; internal administrative correspondence; correspondence with the American Association of University Professors; and exhibits of legal evidence presented at litigation by both Burgum and the administration under the direction of Thomas Clark Pollock, Dean of Washington Square College between 1947 and 1962. The exhibits contain a great deal of published material, such as books, newspapers, journals, court transcripts, articles and essays. They have been included with the other exhibit items within the Senate Faculty Committee series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Burgum records reflect the difficult debates and conflicts in American higher education during the Cold War period. Since the material is administrative in provenance, the collection's series offer insights not only into the scope and nature of the Burgum controversy, but also into the administration's strategies and actions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While the suspension of Burgum by Chancellor Henry Townley Heald was rendered by executive fiat only hours after Burgum's appearance before the Senate subcommittee, neither the Chancellor nor the Vice Chancellor and Secretary, Harold Oliver Voorhis, played an active role in the subsequent hearing of charges against Burgum. The Chancellor's role was to formulate and state the administration's position. The Vice Chancellor acted as a public relations officer who helped to correspond with the University community, the American Association of University Professors and the public at large. Dean Thomas Clark Pollock of Washington Square College recommended the actual dismissal of Burgum and preferred the charges against him. Pollock played the most active role of any administrative official involved. To hear Dean Pollock's charges, the University Council assigned the case to the faculty members of the University Senate. A Senate Faculty Committee was formed consisting of one representative from each of the twelve divisions of the University. This committee had the obligation to render a decision on the Dean's charges, although it did not have the right of final judgment. That Executive Committee of the University Council held that right.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Central to the records, and of particular interest, is the Senate Faculty Committee series. Box 1 contains transcripts of the University's legal trial against Burgum, while boxes 3 and 4 contain trial exhibit material, including exhibits from Burgum's defense and Dean Pollock's prosecution. Also of interest is correspondence in the Office of the Chancellor series. It contains letters of support and protest from the general public, educators, students, alumni, and faculty, and a lengthy set of correspondence between New York University and the American Association of University Professors over AAUP's investigation and censure of the administration's action in the Burgum affair. A particularly valuable overview and critical analysis of the Burgum case can be found in the 1957 report of New York University's investigation committee on the Burgum and Bradley cases. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Edwin Berry Burgum (1894 - 1979) was born in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree at Dartmouth College (1915), a Master's from Harvard (1917), and his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois (1924). In 1924 Burgum began his career as an Associate Professor of English at New York University. In March 1927 he married Mildred Rabinowich.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">His accomplishments included the publication of many books and articles in the field of literary criticism such as The Literary Career of Edward Bulwer Lord Lytton (1926), The New Criticism (1930), Ulysses and the Impasse of Individualism,  (1941) and The Novel and the World's Dilemma, (1947). From 1936 to 1938 Burgum was an active contributor and editor of the Marxist quarterly Science and Society. Burgum served as president of the College Teachers' Union of New York City.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During the McCarthy era Burgum was one of five collegiate faculty members subpoenaed by the McCarran sub-committee of the Senate, organized to investigate communism in American schools. At a hearing in October 1952 Burgum invoked the First and Fifth amendments in response to Senate questions concerning his political beliefs. Arguing that his refusal to answer was a matter of principle, he was subsequently suspended from his teaching post. In April 1953, following his request for a hearing before the NYU Faculty Committee hearing, he was dismissed.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over the next several years, the Committee for the Reinstatement of Professor Burgum, made up of lawyers, teachers and unions, continued to advocate on his behalf. The publication, Academic Freedom and New York University: the Case of Professor Edwin Berry Burgum, resulted from their efforts. Despite NYU's refusal to reinstate Burgum, he continued to publish and pursue his former interests. However, the outcome of his trial took a tragic toll on his family and led to a new career as a lay analyst and psychotherapist. In July of 1979 Burgum died after a long illness.</field>
