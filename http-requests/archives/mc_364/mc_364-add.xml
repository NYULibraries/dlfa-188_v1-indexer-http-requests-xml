    <field name="abstract_teim">Jerome K. Percus (1926-2021) was a physicist and mathematician who taught in both the NYU Departments of Mathematics and Physics and spent the majority of his academic career at NYU. His research and teaching focused on many-body systems, statistical and mathematical physics, biophysics, chemical physics, and mathematical biology. Ora Engelberg Percus was a mathematician who taught as an adjunct professor in the NYU Department of Mathematics, in addition to her previous teaching positions at the University of Tel Aviv, Columbia University's Teachers College, and City College (CUNY). Her primary research interests included many-body systems, probability and queueing theory, and random number generators. The Jerome K. and Ora Engelberg Percus Papers (dated 1933-2021) consist of materials documenting the academic careers of Jerome K. Percus and Ora Engelberg Percus. Materials in this collection include correspondence; college and graduate school coursework; research files, including data and calculations; original writings in various stages of completion; teaching files, including course materials and lecture notes; grant proposals and other project files; and conference presentations. Materials documenting Jerome and Ora's original research represent their scholarly outputs, both as individuals and as collaborators who often co-authored work together. This collection also documents Ora Engelberg Percus' experiences as a woman in the male-dominated field of mathematics. Correspondence, resumes, and legal filings document her tenure denial at City College, CUNY's policy in the 1970s of required unpaid maternity leave, her claims of gender discrimination for being dismissed while pregnant, and her participation in the Melani v. CUNY lawsuit. The collection also includes materials documenting Jerome K. Percus' early life, including childhood drawings, photographs, and school yearbooks.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jerome K. Percus (1926-2021) was a physicist and mathematician who taught in both the NYU Departments of Mathematics and Physics. Percus was a three-time graduate of Columbia University (B.S. in electrical engineering (1947), M.S. in mathematics (1948), and Ph.D. in physics (1954)), and spent the majority of his academic career at NYU. His research and teaching focused on many-body systems, statistical and mathematical physics, biophysics, chemical physics, and mathematical biology.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ora Engelberg Percus (1934-2020) was a mathematician who taught as an adjunct professor in the NYU Department of Mathematics. She graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Physics (1959) and Columbia University with a Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics (1965). Ora taught at the University of Tel Aviv, Columbia University's Teachers College, City College (CUNY), and NYU. Ora struggled to secure consistent academic employment due to her gender and pregnancies. Her primary research interests included many-body systems, probability and queueing theory, and random number generators.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Donated by Allon Percus, son of Jerome K. and Ora Engelberg Percus, in March 2023; the accession number associated with this gift is 2023.027.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">The following materials were reviewed, identified as being out of scope for this collection, and not acquired: financial, legal, and medical records (with the exception of materials documenting Ora Engelberg Percus' employment lawsuit); glass slides with biological materials; family medical records; the majority of the Percus' research and subject files, such as reprints, duplicates, referee reports for peer reviewed articles, and grant proposals; correspondence with students about grades and coursework; grade reports for classes taught by Jerome and Ora; and a small amount of lecture notes and original writings on extremely brittle paper.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Materials concerning the Percus' primary interests were prioritized for retention if any annotations or notes were present. These areas for Jerome included many-body systems, statistical and mathematical physics, biophysics, chemical physics, and mathematical biology. These areas for Ora included many-body systems, probability and queueing theory, and random number generators.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Files concerning Ora Engelberg Percus' challenges securing academic work following the birth of her children are retained in this collection, and document a significant experience in her life and career.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">One floppy disk was appraised out of the collection due to the presence of student coursework and figures used for Jerome K. Percus' writing that could not be rendered through imaging.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Following digitization in February 2024, glass slides in the collection were discarded as hazardous waste as they contained cellulose nitrate film, a fire safety hazard.</field>
