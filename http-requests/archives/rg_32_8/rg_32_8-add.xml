    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Institute of Federal Taxation is a program that originated in the School of Continuing Education (currently the School of Continuing and Professional Studies), although it is also associated with the School of Law and the Stern School of Business. The Institute began in 1941 with presentations and seminars that intended to clarify the complexity of tax law and procedure for professionals seeking to better understand the topic. The Institute publishes a bound volume of proceedings and lectures for each annual meeting, which can last from several days to several weeks. Attendees of the Institute's programs include attorneys, accountants, and others who regularly deal with matters of taxation.</field>
