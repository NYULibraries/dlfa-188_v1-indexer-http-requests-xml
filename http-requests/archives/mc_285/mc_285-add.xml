    <field name="abstract_teim">Hyman Steinberg (1925-2016) was a teacher, scientist, and engineer who held over 20 patents for various inventions, including solar technology innovations, hearing aids, and rotary shavers. He worked in the fields of architecture, engineering, public relations, and consulting, and held positions at New York University (1951-1955) and the John F. Kennedy Space Center (1967-1971). This collection consists of materials created and collected by Steinberg in the 1950s and 1960s documenting his research in solar power and the development, production, and promotion of the Sundiner Solar Cooking Oven (also referred to as a grill in some materials). Materials in this collection include engineering drawings; domestic and international patents; press releases; advertisements; reports for potential investors; photographic negatives, prints, and slides used to demonstrate or promote the grill; and correspondence concerning the business aspects of the invention process, including production and manufacturing costs.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hyman Steinberg (1925-2016) was a teacher, scientist, and engineer who held over 20 patents for various inventions, including solar technology innovations, hearing aids, and rotary shavers. Steinberg served as a Radioman in the United States Navy from 1944-1946, after which he earned his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Engineering (1951) from Oklahoma State University. He worked in the fields of architecture, engineering, public relations, and consulting, and held specialist positions at New York University (1951-1955) and the John F. Kennedy Space Center (1967-1971). A major avenue of Steinberg's innovation focused on applications of solar energy and the development of his invention, the Sundiner Solar Energy Grill.</field>
