    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Administrative Files series consists of 78 boxes. Several folders relate to Brown's civic involvement and concern for philanthropy, culture, and social problems. See folders on the YW and YMCA, Volunteers of America, Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Boy Scouts of America, the National Kindergarten Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Two folders address racial tensions: DuBois, W. E .B. and The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a file which contains correspondence concerning discrimination at NYU. Materials regarding anti-Semitism at NYU and Columbia University can be found in Admissions, Selective, which contains reference to intelligence tests and how these were used (or assumed to be used) to discriminate against certain groups.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">For information about the relationship of NYU to government policy, see the numerous folders dealing with NYU's involvement in World War I, as well as the R.O.T.C. and League of Nations folders.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Throughout Brown's tenure, he showed a genuine interest in student affairs. Many records reflect his personal concern for student clubs, fraternities/sororities, athletic events, etc. These files are inter-filed throughout the collection and are easily identified by titles.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Few records address the role of women in the University. Also lacking is significant correspondence with other collegiate officials outside of NYU. Only folders on Charles Eliot, the President of Harvard and John H. MacCracken, President of Lafayette College contain substantial information.</field>
