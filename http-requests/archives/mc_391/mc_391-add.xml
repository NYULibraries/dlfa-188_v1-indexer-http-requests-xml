    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences Lecture Notes (1912-1984) contains lecture notes created by professors and teaching assistants from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from the 1930s through the 1980s. Additionally, there is a report, a folder of joke "lecture notes" given to K.O. Friedrichs for his birthday, remarks delivered at Richard Courant's memorial, and lectures delivered by Richard Courant and others while teaching at different institutions. Notable lecturers include Richard Courant, Kurt O. Friedrichs, Fritz John, and Peter Lax, to name a few.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences serves as New York Unviersity's mathematics research school. It grew from the Graduate School of Arts and Science's Department of Mathematics starting in 1935, when Richard Courant joined the faculty. The Institute was named the Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in 1946. In that year and in 1954, research projects led to the establishment of the Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics and the Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics, respectively. NYU's first computer was installed at the Courant Institute in 1952, and its Computer Science program rapidly developed to include research on programming languages, computer graphics, parallel architectures, and theory. In 1965, the Institute was renamed after Richard Courant and moved to the newly constructed Warren Weaver Hall, where a majority of its activities still take place. The Division of Computational Fluid Dynamics was created in 1978.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Transferred by Courant Institute Library, August 2023. The accession number associated with the transfer is 2023.058.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">It is assumed that these records were transferred to the Courant Institute Library by their creators. Documentation about these transfers varies across collections, and provenance is not always apparent. The transfer was treated as an administrative transfer to the New York University Archives from the Courant Institute in the summer of 2023 when the Courant Institute Library closed.</field>
