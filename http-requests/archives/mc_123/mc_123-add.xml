After attending high school in Brooklyn, he enrolled in NYU, where he would earn four degrees -- Bachelor of Commercial Science (1931), Master of Arts from the School of Education (1932), Master of Business Administration (1933), and Doctor of Commercial Science (1935). Three years after earning his PhD, Backman became an instructor in economics at NYU. He continued to serve on the faculties of the School of Commerce/College of Business Administration (now the Leonard N. Stern School of Business) from 1938 to 1975. As Professor Emeritus he continued to teach in an adjunct capacity.</field>

He published widely on the subject of pricing. His books include Adventures in Price Fixing (1936), Administered Prices (1957), and Entrepreneurship and the Outlook for America (published posthumously in 1983).</field>

He worked in the Office of Price Administration in the early 1940s and was an adviser to the President's Cost of Living Committee. Subsequently, he served on state and local advisory groups, including the Governor's Commission on Milk Marketing, the New York Joint Legislative Committee on Rents, and as consultant to the U.S. General Accounting Office and the New Jersey Rate Counsel.</field>
