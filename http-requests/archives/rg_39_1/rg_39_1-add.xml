    <field name="abstract_teim">The Eucleian Society was a literary society founded at the University of the City of New-York (New York University) in 1832, the year instruction began. It seems to have ceased around the 1940s. Literary societies were the major extracurricular activity of Jacksonian and mid-19th century colleges and universities. The Eucleian Society was dedicated to furthering the literary arts where members would assemble for one hour to hear debates between panels made up of members of the Society and were usually preceeded by readings of essays, orations, and poems. Shortly after its founding, the Society began printing orations and poems delivered by guest speakers at annual or anniversary meetings. In the 20th century, the Eucleians published The Knickerbocker, The Medley, and The Geyser. The collection includes the Society's records, membership lists, constitution, and minutes.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although a small and partial collection, the records of the Eucleian Society (1832-1909) are particularly valuable because there are few other remaining sources of information about the Eucleians. The researcher should consult the historical volume (volume 1) of Universities and their Sons at New York University, by Chancellor Henry M. MacCracken and Professor Ernest G. Sihler, 1901 (available in the N.Y.U. Archives), pp. 78-80 esp., for a description of the Eucleians' early years and of the room assigned to the Society in the original University Building at Washington Square. Also see the finding aid for the Records of the Philomathean Society in the New York University Archives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Society's records also offer primary source material for New York University's literary societies, particularly for the 1830s to mid 1890s. Minutes and programs of meetings, membership rosters, lists of topics of debates (unfortunately no records of the actual debates remain), and memorabilia make up the bulk of the collection. Although the documents date from 1832 to 1904, there are many gaps. For example, the minutes only run from 1840-1869 and 1880-1895.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records have been arranged in four series:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series 1: Official Records and Correspondence (1832-1904)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mostly bound volumes of manuscript material, including the Adelphic Society documents. Minutes, treasurer's accounts, pledge roles, constitutions and by-laws, membership invitations, court minutes, attendance records, farewell addresses, and acceptance speeches.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series 2: Meetings (1834-1886)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Programs of meetings, a list of orators for 1866, appointment book for debates (1868-1873), published addresses delivered at meetings, appointment slips (1879-1886), invitations, and tickets.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series 3: Memorabilia (1863)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There is one pin with an accompanying letter.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series 4: Joint Meetings (1835-1854)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Published addresses delivered at joint meetings of the Eucleian and Philomathean Societies , invitation cards, and New York Daily Times review (June 27, 1894)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series 5: Miscellaneous (undated)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Contains a list of Eucleian and Philomathean Society publication.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series 6: The Medley</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Contains cartoons related to The Medley.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Eucleian Society apparently had its origins in the Adelphic Literary Sociey, one of two literary societies founded at the University of the City of New-York (New York University) in 1832, the year instruction began. The Eucleian Society seems to have succeeded the Adelphic in 1833 and is last mentioned in the University Heights Palisades handbook in 1942-43 and in the Violet yearbook in the 19th edition. It outlived the other literary society, the Philomathean, by some 50 years.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Literary societies were the major extracurricular activity of Jacksonian and mid-19th century colleges and universities. From its inception, the Eucleian Society was dedicated to furthering the literary arts. Every Friday afternoon, the members would assemble for one hour to hear debates between panels made up of members of the Society, who were assigned topics .* These debates were usually preceeded by readings of essays, orations, and poems. Annual and anniversary programs were also held. In addition to these intra-society activities, there were joint meetings with the Philomethean Society, with whom there was considerable rivalry. The first known joint meeting was held in 1835. Students were encouraged to join literary societies and participate in debating and oratory as part of their collegiate experience.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">An early literary endeavor of the Eucleians was the establishment of their own library to supplement that of the University. Two lists of the Eucleian's library holdings are in this collection. The 177 item listing includes a copy of the Legacy of A. Ogden Butler for $2,500. The interest on this legacy appears to have been the financial base for the Society.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Shortly after its founding, the Society began printing orations and poems delivered by guest speakers at annual or anniversary meetings. The earliest known copy of such a publication is an 1835 address.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the 20th century, the Eucleians sporadically published their own literary magazines. The Knickerbocker, described by its editors as "a small paper of a rather light character," appears only to have been issued twice, March 15, 1900 (vol. 1, no. 1) and Jan. 1901 (nos. 2 and 3). In 1913, the Eucleian Society launched The Medley, a humor magazine, at the University Heights campus. As of vol. 4 , no. 2 (Nov. 1916), reference to the Eucleian Society is dropped, publication apparently continued by the general student body. From 1926-28, the Eucleians sponsored The Geyser, another humor publication which seems to have lasted only for those few years. Copies of these publications and other Eucleian Society printed materials can be found in the New York University Archives (see attached list).</field>
