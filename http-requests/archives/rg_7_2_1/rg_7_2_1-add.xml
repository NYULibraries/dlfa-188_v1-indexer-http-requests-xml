    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Office Of The Vice President for University Relations was created in 1957 in response to the New York University Self-Study which recognized a need for two-way communication between the university and the community which it served. The Self-Study, published in 1956, was financed by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, and represented a major attempt at long-range planning under the leadership of then Chancellor Henry T. Heald. In the same year, a restructuring of administrative titles took place at NYU: the Chancellor became President and Vice Chancellors became Vice Presidents.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The new Vice President for University Relations became responsible for dissemination of information about New York University programs, and supervision of communication with the University community, and its neighbors through NYU's radio, television and publication units. During Chancellor Heald's administration (1952-56) the Public Relations Department had been responsible for the Office of Publication and Printing and for Information Services. The responsibility for these services was administratively transferred to the Vice President for University Relations when the new office was established and the directors of both units reported to him.</field>

A graduate of Broaddus College (now Alderson-Broaddus), Vice President Brandon held an M.A. from Bucknell University, an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from Oklahoma Baptist University and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters was conferred by Alderson-Broaddus in 1962.
