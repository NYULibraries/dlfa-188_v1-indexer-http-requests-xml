    <field name="bioghist_teim">Albert Warren Ferris was born in Brooklyn in 1856, when Ferris' grandfather, Isaac Ferris, was Chancellor of the University of the City of New York (now New York University).  The younger Ferris entered NYU in 1874.  Elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior, Ferris also served as senior class president, editor of the University Quarterly, and senior regent in the Intercollegiate Literary Association.  He graduated as Greek salutatorian of the class of 1878.  Ferris was also a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity as an undergraduate.
Ferris earned a medical degree from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1882 and an M.A. from NYU in 1885. He was elected president of the NYU Alumni Association in 1905.  
Ferris became a prominent physician in the developing field of psychiatry and served as president of the New York State Lunacy Commission from 1907 to 1911. He died in 1937.</field>
