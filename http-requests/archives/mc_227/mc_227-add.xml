    <field name="abstract_teim">The Faneuil Weisse Collection of Student Notebooks are a collection of notebooks written by students of Dr. Weisse covering the oral surgery clinics he conducted at New York College of Dentistry. Dr. Weisse was a founding faculty member of NYCD in 1865 and acted as Dean from 1897-1912. The notebooks cover his oral surgery clinics from 1881-1912, with some gaps and some overlaps. This collection will be of great value to anyone interested in the history of dentistry, oral surgery and medicine in general. The case studies provide a look at some interesting cases and are a primary source demonstrating what best practices were considered to be in the field at the turn of the century.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Faneuil Weisse Collection of Student Notebooks consist of twenty-two notebooks containing notes on oral surgery clinics led by Faneuil Weisse between 1881 and 1912. The clinic notebooks are variously titled as Reports, Records, or Notes, but are essentially all versions of the same "Annual Record of Oral Surgery Clinics" containing details of case studies presented by Professor Weisse at the New York College of Dentistry. Two of them have very peculiar titles; "Styposulphide of Soda" and Inshallah Malaish ( followed by text indicating that this is Arabic for God willing - who knows!) but contain the same type of clinical notes as the other volumes. The notebooks were written by different student authors over the years. Some of the reports are in manuscript form and others from later dates are typed or printed. The topics covered in the clinics range from simple cleft palates to more unusual incidents, like amputating a patient's finger and fusing it to their face in order to create a new nose.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York College of Dentistry was founded in 1865 with only 31 students and 10 faculty members. One of the founders and first faculty members was Faneuil D. Weisse, an MD oral surgeon. Weisse stayed on as a faculty member for many years and served as Dean of the College from 1897 - 1912. Weisse passed away in 1915. The school became part of New York University in 1925 and was known as New York University College of Dentistry from then on.</field>
