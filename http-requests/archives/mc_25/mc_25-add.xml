    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of materials collected by Charles H. Snow for his unpublished manuscript, "The Camp on Campus: The Great War as Observed From a College Campus." The majority of the materials are drafts of the manuscript itself, which chronicles New York University's involvement with the military during World War I.  Additional material includes twenty years of correspondence and memoranda which Snow collected while conducting research for the manuscript. Photographs illustrating various historical points made in the manuscript are also included.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I includes original research material collected by Dr. Snow containing contemporary documentation from the World War I era. Also included is general correspondence ranging over eighteen years; some letters describes buildings and life on campus during the war years, and others relate to research and publication of the manuscript.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included in Series II are many different versions of the manuscript preface, table of contents, eighteen chapters, appendices, and index. A 1943 note from Dr. Snow details what the object of his manuscript was and why he decided not to publish it.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Charles Henry Snow was born in New York City on March 24, 1863. He attended New York University's (NYU) School of Civil Engineering and graduated in 1886. He received an honorary Sc.M. in 1894 and a Sc.D. in 1898 from the Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh). He joined NYU's Engineering faculty in 1891, and, in 1897, became Dean of the School of Civil Engineering.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1899 school's name was changed to the School of Applied Science (and was later changed to the College of Engineering). With Dean Snow at its helm, the school played a leading role during World War I, as NYU was one of the first universities to respond to President Woodrow Wilson's call for the training of engineering personnel. Dean Snow was the civilian director of the National Army Training Detachment (later Student Army Training Corps, Section B), where eleven hundred "Fighting Mechanics" were trained at NYU's campus at University Heights. As civilian director of these units, Dean Snow acted as liaison between the U.S. War Department and the University.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dean Snow was author of "The Principal Species of Wood," (1903, 1908); "Wood and Other Organic Structure Materials," (1917); and several other papers in transactions with technical societies. He was also a member of New York City Mayor's Commission for National Defense, 1915-18; New York City Mayor's Committee of Citizens to arrange the Public Celebration of July Fourth, 1916-17; and a U.S. War Department appraisal expert, aircraft production, service at large, 1919.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dean Snow served as Vice President of the NYU Senate from 1920 to 1931 and was named emeritus dean in 1930. He died October 29, 1957.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The papers of Charles H. Snow were a part of a larger College of Engineering historical collection that covered the years 1897-1956. The collection was most likely accumulated at the University Heights Library over a period of approximately twenty years and was transferred to the University Archives when the School of Engineering closed in 1973.</field>
