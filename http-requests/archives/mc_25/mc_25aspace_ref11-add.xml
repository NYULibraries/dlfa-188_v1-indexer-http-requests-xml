    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Included in Series I is original research material collected by Dr. Snow that contains a considerable amount of contemporary documentation from the World War I era. There are charts depicting the relationship between the National Army Training Detachment and the Student Army Training Corps (SATC) on the New York University Heights campus, a letter describing military training on the campus during the years 1917-1918, a list describing the nationality of some of the NYU staff dating to just before the U.S. entrance into World War I, a letter describing the relationship between the University Heights Church and the SATC, and a letter describing the commissary serving the SATC on the Heights campus. Also included is general correspondence ranging over eighteen years, with letters describing buildings and life on campus during the war years, a copy of a March 1922 letter asking for aid from a professor in Petrograd, comments on the manuscript by Professor Theodore F. Jones, and several letters from Dr. Snow to publishers. Among the memoranda, 1917-1935, are lists of men who left the campus for duty in 1917, notes on the influenza epidemic of 1918-1919, a memorandum on a Memorial Tablet for Alumni, Faculty, and Students who died in service during World War I, and a 1930 report from the Dean of the College of Engineering defending military instruction on campus and criticizing the University for not having yet published a list of students who served in the war.</field>
