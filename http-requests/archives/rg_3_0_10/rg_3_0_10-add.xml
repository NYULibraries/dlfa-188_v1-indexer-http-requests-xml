    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains records of New York University's 13th President John Brademas who served from 1981 to 1991. Files created by Brademas' office contain material related to the responsibilities of this position, including public appearances and events; contact with various NYU Schools and Divisions staff; interaction with student groups and representatives; and fostering NYU's relationships with various governmental departments and other organizations as they relate to funding and/or educational policy for universities. 


Files in this collection include Brademas' speeches and remarks; NYU Board meeting material; and public relations event planning files which include video recordings related to NYU's acquisition of the La Pietra villa. Additionally, this collection contains internal and external communications, reports, and meeting notes related to NYU facilities, NYU Schools and Divisions, and student groups. Files accumulated by Brademas on individuals, organizations, and companies document his relationships cultivated for the purpose of fundraising, educational policy support, and NYU program development. Although a selection of Brademas' chronological correspondence has its own series, a significant amount of topical correspondence can be found throughout the entire collection. 


Pre-1981 office files in this collection were likely a carry-over from the previous President's office and used for reference by Brademas and his staff. Material dated beyond Brademas' term found in this collection covers projects he continued for NYU working as president emeritus, after officially leaving office in 1991.


This collection also includes photographs and negatives of professors, students, and NYU locations in other countries. These photographs may have been used in NYU publications. Countries highlighted in the photographs and negatives include the United Kingdom, Italy, France, and Afghanistan. The photographs of professors consist of portraits and candid shots. There are also several oversized photographs of President Jay Oliva.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Stephen John Brademas, Jr. (1927-2016) was born in Mishawaka, Indiana to Beatrice Goble Brademas, a schoolteacher, and Stephen John Brademas, Sr., a Greek-immigrant restaurateur. Brademas graduated from South Bend Central High School and entered the University of Notre Dame in 1945, but soon left to join the Navy where he was appointed to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps until May 1946. In September of that year, he entered Harvard College and in 1949 graduated with a B.A. in Government. From 1950 to 1953, he studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, England, where he received a Doctor of Philosophy in Social Studies.


From 1959 to 1980, Brademas represented the Third District of Indiana in the United States House of Representatives. He served on the Education and Labor Committee, the House Administration Committee, and the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress. Brademas played a principal role in writing major legislation concerning all forms of education, including elementary, collegiate, and vocational training. He was also a major proponent of legislation for services for the elderly and handicapped, as well as Federal support for cultural institutions and the arts. In January 1973, Brademas was appointed Chief Deputy Majority Whip and in 1977 was appointed Majority Whip, a position he held for the next four years.


After leaving public office, Brademas accepted the position of President of New York University (NYU), serving from 1981 to 1992. During his tenure, he worked to change NYU from a primarily commuter school by facilitating the construction or purchase of 11 residence halls, which by the time he left, housed 44 percent of the NYU student population. Under his guidance, NYU also added new academic programs including the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies and the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies. During his tenure, Brademas established NYU programs in Cyprus, Egypt, France, Israel and Japan. In July of 1990, he announced his resignation and officially stepped down from his position, becoming president emeritus in 1992 after a sabbatical. 


After leaving NYU, Brademas served as chairman of the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities from 1994 to 2001. From 2004 to 2007, he was a member of the New York State Board of Regents. In 2005, NYU established the John Brademas Center of New York University, a research and teaching facility. He was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees and awards, many conferred by European governments or cultural organizations. Brademas passed away in 2016.</field>
