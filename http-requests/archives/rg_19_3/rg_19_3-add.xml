    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Dorothy McSparran Arnold Papers describe the evolution of the counseling and programming system Washington Square College developed to coordinate students' intellectual growth with their development as social and moral beings. The papers also reveal the growth of strong women's organizations at the college and present some insights into the attitudes toward women and their roles. Washington Square College, set in an urban environment with a large commuter student body, valued and promoted the extracurricular customs of undergraduate life. Societies and sororities, athletics, undergraduate class loyalties and clubs were community builders. Student activities created the illusion of a society in miniature, preparing the student for citizenship and building loyalty and friendships at the college.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As the College grew in size, the Dean's Office became formally responsible for assuring the academic and personal advisory roles faculty had handled. These responsibilities were gradually divided. The academic counseling, remaining under the authority of the Dean's office was assigned to teaching faculty. The 'official' social and personal counseling became the preserve of faculty (and later student affairs specialists) removed from active teaching. Student activities and counseling became the business of the administration rather than the faculty. Dorothy Arnold switched from teaching to student affairs administrator in 1924, and her career spanned the next 43 years.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The papers have rich material on women's organizations at the College. The League of Women and the Eclectic Society records cover more than thirty years (1920's-50's), giving early organizational information on the group's activities, membership and selection. The Junior Advisory Committee and Faculty Advisory Corps records offer a view of the college's academic and peer counseling programs. There is limited material on fraternity/sorority relations and freshman orientation in the thirties and fifties. Information on the decline of women's athletics is in several folders of the Faculty Advisory Board (1929-1958). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records of the Student Committee on Educational Policy (1947-59) indicate the shift to give students a more important role in college governance. An important theme throughout the papers is the constant fight Dean Arnold waged for money for adequate facilities and programs for women. The annual reports, the building office file, and the athletic files reveal the struggle. Mrs. Arnold's interest in linking college women to national organizations and interests appear in the American Association of University Women and Mortar Board files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dorothy McSparran Arnold received a B.A. from Cornell University in 1918. She was a professor and administrator at Washington Square College for 43 years. Arnold began in 1924 as a young instructor in the English department. A year after her arrival, during the 1925-26 school year, she began working as a counselor and administrator for women students at Washington Square College. She was named chairman of the faculty committee on women's interests and, as the catalog for that year states, "Matters affecting the interests of girls in the college should be referred to Mrs. Arnold." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The next year she became the official Advisor to Women. In December of 1928, the Council appointed her Assistant Dean, recognizing her as an administrator. She received her academic promotion to Assistant Professor in 1926.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">She continued as an Assistant Dean until November of 1948, when she became Dean of Women. She reported directly to the Dean of Washington Square College. She served as Dean until her retirement in 1961. As Advisor and Dean, Mrs. Arnold was concerned with promoting the welfare of women students. She worked with students, providing continuity, structure and development of new programs for women. In addition to personal counseling, she served as advisor to many of the campus' women's organizations. Her office organized or coordinated many activities of the League of Women, women's honorary and social societies and women's athletics. She also helped to develop The Junior Advisors Committee, a peer counseling program to aid freshwomen and transfer students' adjustment to college life. The League of Women, the Eclectic honorary society and Pan-Hellenic Council were other vehicles for recognizing and developing women student leaders.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">As an administrator Dorothy Arnold worked for women students, providing representation on college committees directly concerned with student issues. She was a member of the Faculty Advisory Committee for Women's Athletics, Faculty Committee on fraternities and sororities connected with the Student Committee on Educational Policy, various scholarship committees and the committee on faculty-student advising. She was also an advisor on disciplinary, and financial aid matters. As a Dean she participated on college and university governance committees, the Cabinet of the College, Advisement Council, and the Council of Deans.</field>
