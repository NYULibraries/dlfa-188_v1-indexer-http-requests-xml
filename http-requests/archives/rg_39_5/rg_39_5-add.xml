Correspondence is predominantly between WNYU's staff and other constituent parts of the University, including Joseph Steinberg, the station's manager during the 1960s with University offices; the Inter-Colligiate Broadcasting System; Miller, Montgomery and Spanding concerning construction for WNYU facilities; and Larry J. Hollander, the faculty advisor to the WYNU staff, with Steinberg. Other correspondence relates to the broader media and metropolitan community, such as correspondence of the staff with fellow radio stations including the Columbia University station, concerning such topics as the election of 1964, Ray Nelson, and a Senator Claiborne Pell interview about youth legislation; letters from The New York Times to Arnold Rosner, Director of Classical Music at WNYU; letters from the Police Department of New York City; and letters from United Press International.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">WNYU was formed in 1949 on the University Heights campus of New York University by a group of engineers. Initially, the station only broadcast to the University Heights cafeteria. Well established by 1956, WNYU became a member of the Inter-Collegiate Broadcasting System (IBS). In 1955 the radio division of the Television, Motion Picture and Radio Department of the Communications Arts Group started a closed circuit station, WCAG, at the Washington Square Campus. In 1963 WNYU (Heights Station) and WCAG (Washington Square Station) merged into one closed circuit radio station through the use of a telephone cable. It was decided that WCAG would broadcast to both campuses during the day while WNYU would take over in the evenings. This continued until 1973, when NYU sold the University Heights campus. At that time the equipment was brought to Loeb Student Center on Washington Square. During the period of 1965-1973 the station worked to acquire an FM frequency. In 1965 NYU made an agreement with the United Nations to use their channel, "206." NYU submitted their first application to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in 1965. After three years the FCC decided that channel "206" should be shared by NYU and Fairleigh Dickinson University of New Jersey. WNYU broadcast from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The records of WNYU Radio Station were transferred to the New York University Archives when the radio station was moved from Gould Memorial Library at the University Heights campus to Loeb Student Center on Washington Square in June 1973. Further accretions to the collection have been added in the intervening years.</field>
