    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection includes audiovisual and born-digital recordings of events at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, including lectures given by faculty and guests, symposia, anniversary celebrations, and the Warren Weaver Hall Dedication Ceremony; interviews with scholars and faculty including Ernest Courant, Herbert Morawetz, and Harold Shapiro; early forays into animation, likely by the Computer Science Program; and promotional materials, such as brochures, promotional images, and a 75th Anniversary video. The Courant Institute initially grew from the Graduate School of Arts and Science's Department of Mathematics and serves as New York Unviersity's mathematics research school.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences serves as New York University's mathematics research school.  It grew from the Graduate School of Arts and Science's Department of Mathematics, which began to focus on research projects following Richard Courant's appointment in 1935. The Institute was named the Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in 1946. In that year and 1954, research projects led to the establishment of the Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics and the Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics, respectively. NYU's first computer was installed at the Courant Institute in 1952, and its Computer Science program rapidly developed to include research on programming languages, computer graphics, parallel architectures, and theory. In 1965 the Institute was renamed after Richard Courant and moved to the newly constructed Warren Weaver Hall, where a majority of its activities still take place. The Division of Computational Fluid Dynamics was created in 1978.</field>
