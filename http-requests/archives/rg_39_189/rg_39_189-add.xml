    <field name="bioghist_teim">New York University has had many student newspapers since its founding. The University Heights campus and the Washington Square campus had separate student newspapers until 1973 when the University Heights campus was closed. The Washington Square campus held summer sessions for students, and from 1937-1947 it had its own newspaper called Summer Sessions News. The Washington Square College Bulletin, later called the Washington Square Bulletin, ran concurrent with the Heights Daily News and was succeeded by the Washington Square Journal.</field>
