    <field name="custodhist_teim">The administrative records of Francis Hovey Stoddard, 1904-1915, form part of Record Group 18.0.1, Records of the Office of the Dean, University College of Arts and Pure Science. The papers were presumably deposited in the Treasure Room of Memorial Library on the University Heights campus of New York University along with the files of Archibald L. Bouton, who succeeded Stoddard as dean. The records were subsequently transferred to the Washington Square campus following the sale of the University Heights campus in 1972. In October 1977 the University Archives accessioned both the Stoddard and Bouton papers.</field>
