    <field name="bioghist_teim">Kramer worked at the Wiltwyck School for Boys in the 1940s and 1950s. This school was founded by the Episcopal City Mission Society in 1936 as a school and residential treatment facility for Black boys who were diverted from the juvenile justice system. In 1942, the Episcopal City Mission Society announced it could no longer financially support Wiltwyck. At this time group of concerned citizens, including Eleanor Roosevelt, recognized the value of Wiltwyck and banded together to fund the school and reorganize it under the State Department of Social Welfare. After the reorganization the school was non-secular and racially integrated, and in 1953 Wiltwyck began to accept students with emotional disabilities.1 </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After leaving Wiltwyck, Kramer worked as an art therapist at the Leak and Watts Children's Home, the Turtle Bay Music School, the Guild School of the Jewish Guild for the Blind, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Child Psychiatry.</field>
