    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection reflects Edith Kramer's work as an artist, art therapist, and teacher. She began making art as a child and this collection includes artworks she created throughout her life. The majority of her artworks in the collection are pencil and ink drawings, but she worked in many media including sculpture, mosaic, collage, oil and watercolor paints, and printmaking, all of which are also represented in this collection. Kramer created mosaic murals for two New York City subway stations, Spring Street and Union Square, and this collection includes proposals and planning documents related to these two murals as well as proposals for others subway station murals that were never made. The collection also includes drawings of subway stations, trains, and riders. In addition to original artworks, there are slides and photographs of many of her pieces. The collection also includes files related to Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, Kramer's childhood art teacher and mentor; personal correspondence; and date books.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents Kramer's work as a practicing art therapist, most notably her work at Wiltwyck School for Boys, a residential treatment facility in Esopus, New York. Kramer's notes about patients at Wilkwyck, artwork created by these patients in the course of art therapy, and example artworks created by Kramer are all included, as are documents related to and drafts of her 1958 book, Art therapy in a children's community: a study of the function of art therapy in the treatment program of Wiltwyck School for Boys. Slides and photographs also document patient artwork.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Kramer's work as an academic is documented in scholarly publications, including journal articles and her 1971 book, Art as Therapy with Children. The collection also includes syllabi, lecture notes and recordings, and a program prospectus for the graduate program in art therapy at New York University. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Edith Kramer was born in 1916 in Vienna, Austria. At the age of 13, she began studying art under the tutelage of Friedl Dicker-Brandeis, an artist who worked within the Bauhaus movement. Dicker-Brandeis moved to Prague in 1934, and Kramer traveled there with her. While in Prague both women taught art to the children of families who had fled Nazi Germany. Kramer credited this formative experience with inspiring her interest in art therapy. Kramer grew up in a family with strong interests in Freudian psychoanalysis, and neo-Freudian concepts regarding attachment, aggression, and libidinal impulses later influenced her views on art therapy. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1938 Kramer fled Austria and arrived in New York City as a refugee. In 1938 she began teaching art and shop classes at the Little Red School House in Greenwich Village and she later went on to work in a machine shop during World War II.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1950 she was appointed art therapist at the Wiltwyck School for Boys in Esopus, New York. This appointment marked her first formal position as an art therapist. Her experiences at Wiltwyck inspired her seminal book, Art Therapy in a Children's Community, published in 1958. Over the next decades she made a name for herself as one of the pioneers of art therapy and worked to develop art therapy programs in a number of children's institutions including the Leak and Watts Children's Home, the Turtle Bay Music School, the Guild School of the Jewish Guild for the Blind, and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Department of Child Psychiatry. These experiences informed her 1971 work, Art Therapy with Children.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1971 Kramer was part of the team that founded an art therapy program at George Washington University. She then came to New York University in 1973 to create a graduate program in art therapy at the School of Education, Health, Nursing, and the Arts Professions (now the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development). By 1976, the program had obtained approval from the New York State Department of Education, and in 1979 it was one of the first programs to receive approval from the American Art Therapy Association.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Kramer was also an artist during her time in academia; she worked part-time as a professor and continued as a working artist. Kramer worked as a painter, sculptor, printmaker, mosaicist, and collage-maker and her works include landscapes, industrial paintings, sketches, etchings, and a number of sculptures. A mosaic she created for the Metropolitan Transit Authority may be found in the Spring Street A/C/E subway stop.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Kramer retired from NYU in 2005. She continued to lecture and make art until her death in 2014 at the age of 97.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The collection was donated to the University Archives by David Henley in 2011.</field>
