    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials in the World War I Collection were compiled between the spring of 1920 and the summer of 1922 with the intention of publishing a New York University World War Memorial Volume. The collection contains an alphabetical list of NYU faculty, students, and alumni who served in the war as well as the completed questionnaires that were circulated in order to compile the information. The list provides the name, rank, service dates, and special honors of the individuals who served in the war and replied to the questionnaire. Since not all of the questionnaires were replied to the list is not exhaustive, however, it is extensive and includes the records of the individuals associated with New York University who died in the war.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Following the end of World War I, an effort was made to create a War Record documenting the names and short biographical narratives of all the students, alumni, and faculty of New York University who served in the war. Between the spring of 1920 and summer of 1922 Clinton Mindil, a professor of English at NYU, distributed questionnaires to individuals affiliated with the university who were known or believed to have served in the war. The questionnaire was circulated six times with the intention of compiling a comprehensive list of names to publish a New York University World War Memorial Volume through the New York University Press. Not all of the distributed questionnaires were completed and returned, and the volume was never published, however, the list of names and completed questionnaires provide a deeper look at how NYU was involved in and affected by the war.</field>
