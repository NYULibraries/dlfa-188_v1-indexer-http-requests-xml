    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains materials related to Hess' personal life, artwork, high school and college experiences, and a later book project from the 2000s. Early art study files include pencil and ink sketches, cartoons, and color pencil drawings, along with mail order lesson books and exercises from W.L. Evans. The cartoon artworks in this series were often used in both high school and later college publications, and often humorously address school-specific topics. Materials related to the University of Chicago High School date from the late 1920s and include class papers, ephemera, and school publications with Hess' cartoons. Poster-size and smaller painted artwork images for the high school yearbook The Correlator are also in this series. This series also includes Hess' Dartmouth College ephemera, class papers and exams, his The Dartmouth editor's notebook, and sports programs and school publications containing his cartoons. The series also contains a small number of files on the temperance movement that had been accumulated by Hess, including drafts of articles written and various organizational brochures. Files in this series relate to the 2005 book commissioned by Hess to honor J. Richardson Dilworth, Dilworth Here, and include communications with the author, copies of the book, responses from readers, and interview transcripts with Dilworth friends, dating from the early 2000s.</field>
