    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists of records of the Office of Radio and Television from 1956-1980. The materials are arranged chronologically within each file.  The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence, memos, scripts, prospectuses, cue sheets, handwritten notes, program outlines, news clippings and press releases. These records reflect program management activities rather than administrative functions or policy decisions. They are primarily concerned with program research, public relations, arranging hosts and guests, and recording productions. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries illustrates both the educational and public relations functions of radio and television at New York University. Many educational programs and talk shows emphasized an urban theme in keeping with the University's concern for building a positive public image of itself as an exciting, urban campus. The increasing importance of the Office of Radio and Television as a public relations vehicle is evident in the records of "Wisdom Bank," a clearinghouse for promoting media appearances by NYU faculty and administrators and of "College Career Clinic."  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although the collection does not fully document the Sunrise Semester program, several files contain materials pertaining to the program. The materials also document the management of the University Broadcast Lab, a series of programs developed and produced by NYU students. Students wrote, directed, and performed original works and adaptations of well-known plays. The records of University Broadcast Lab include production meeting notes, which show organizational methods and the students' relations with faculty advisors and administration. </field>
