    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries consists of records of the Office of Radio and Television from 1953 to 1980. The materials are arranged chronologically within each file. The files are arranged alphabetically, though only files "E" through "Science" are represented. The major portion of the records are memos, scripts, prospectus cue sheets, handwritten notes, program outlines, news clippings, and press releases. They show the program management of specific shows, including research, public relations, arrangement with hosts and guests, and recording schedules. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection does include some information about administrative functions of the office of Radio and Television, primarily its connection to the University Press Office.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These records illustrate how the office of Radio and Television worked in the realms of both education and public relations. In addition, as many of the programs dealt with current events, the series provides more general historical information. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials containing information on Get Involved!, a program sponsored by The Women's City Club of New York, exist in the collection. The program ran from 1969 to 1970 and was designed to bring important issues of the day to the public; topics included urban decay, women's rights and racial tension. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Also documented is The Lively Arts, a 1964 program which centered on cultural events of the times. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other documents describe the radio station's lecture series, in which speeches made on the NYU campus were edited and broadcast. The files include speeches made by Isaac Asimov, A. M. Rosenthal (Managing Editor of The New York Times) and Gerald G. Glasser (NYU Professor of Business Statistics.) 
Other lectures include those made by former President Lyndon Johnson at the 1971 Arthur K. Salomon lecture and  by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the 1977 Arthur K. Salomon Lecture. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subseries also documents Masterbuilders of America, a program running from 1963-1964 that focused on the history of engineering in the United States. The show evidences the University's interest in television as an educational medium. The show was a joint effort with NBC, whose contract did not allow for the show to be rebroadcast and who destroyed the tapes; as such, these files provide some of the only access to the shows. Most of the administrative information is found in the files entitled "Reports."</field>
