    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of these records consists of correspondence, primarily of Ralph Rourke, then the Assistant to the Director of Radio &amp; Television, show scripts, program formats, budgets news clippings and press releases. These records reflect program management activities. They are primarily concerned with program funding and research, guest lists, guest questions, public relations, program scheduling and production. This series illustrates both the educational and even more important the public relations aspects of the office. Shows such as "Soul of Reason" and "Black Depths" examined topical aspects of black life, culture, politics and history. Shows like "Stock Market Observer" and "Taxpayers Clinic" provided the general viewing public with financial and investment information as well as forthcoming income tax filing changes. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Minutes from meetings of the University Television Committee, committee member names, early proposals and funding tactics are included here. The materials also document the University Broadcast Lab series. This was a highly successful endeavor which aired on WNYC-TV Channel 31 on Sundays from 6:00 to 6:30 am. In this series NYU students directed produced and performed in various productions. Included here are script samples, directors' kits and make-up techniques. The materials also document the NYU weekly radio show "Sound of Science," which first aired on WRCA on February 19, 1958. An early production of the office of Radio and Television, the show sought to promote the recognition and encouragement of scientific talent.</field>
