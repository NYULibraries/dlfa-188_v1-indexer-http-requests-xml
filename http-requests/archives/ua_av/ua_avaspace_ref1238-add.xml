The video quality of this disk is clear and the people speaking within the room are relatively easy to hear and comprehend especially when McLuhan speaks.The tape starts in the middle of a group discussion. The setting is in an office with a large table. The audience participates, asking McLuhan questions and receiving answers from him. The majority of the discussion is based on McLuhan's "Laws of Media" which is a four part tetrad of things that share an "interlocking nature" when humans consume media. The four parts are Enhance, Reverse, Retrieve, Obsolescence. His discussion raises concern on mans responsibility for technologies and its effect on humans. He argues that we need studies about technology in order to shape them properly for consumption. Part of his argument is about adverting in the American home as opposed to foreign advertising which is much less prevalent in private lives. He also discusses the effects of politicians becoming visually and verbally known by the general public. The discussion ends with the conclusion that our current media is an "open game" meaning that nothing is finalized. McLuhan concludes that he does not believe there is a solidified answer to his questions. Instead he views it as a continued exploration. The film ends with questions from the audience where McLuhan fields questions, takes business cards, and hands back his portable mic he was using.</field>
