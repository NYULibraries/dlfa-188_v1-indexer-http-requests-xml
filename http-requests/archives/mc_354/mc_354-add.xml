    <field name="scopecontent_teim">New York University Archives Collection on Virtual Commencement Celebrations Webpages documents the virtual commencement proceedings for New York University and its school ceremonies from 2020-2022. The collection contains video streams of the ceremonies, awards, student profiles, messages from deans, names of graduates, and commencement programs.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">In March 2020, New York University shifted to remote activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to the postponement of in-person commencement events and a pivot to virtual events in May 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic continued into 2021, and virtual commencement ceremonies also occurred that year. In 2022, the unviersity went back to in-person commencement ceremonies and the university and schools also celebrated the Classes of 2020 and 2021 also in-person.</field>
