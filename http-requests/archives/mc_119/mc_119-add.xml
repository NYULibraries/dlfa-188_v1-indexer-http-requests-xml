    <field name="bioghist_teim">Undergraduate courses in Political Economy and Finance were being offered at NYU as early as 1846 as part of the Political Science Department's curriculum. In 1895, Political Economy and Finance professor Frank M. Colby became the sole faculty member of the newly formed Graduate School Department of Economics. Undergraduate courses in economics continued to be offered solely by the Department of Political Science until 1912, when an undergraduate Department of Economics was established.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Earning a masters degree in economics at NYU in the 1970s required the completion of 32 credits as well as a masters thesis. The thesis was usually written under the supervision of an advisor as the primary goal of a course entitled "Reading and Research in Economics." The Chairman of the Economics Department during the time these theses were produced was Dr. M. Ishaq Nadiri. Most of the theses are signed as having been approved by the students' faculty advisors. Some of these names can be found as access points.</field>
