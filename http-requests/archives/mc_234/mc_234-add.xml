The objects in this collection vary in gender, color, size, place of origin, and sometimes patterns or markings.  The collection also includes utilitarian objects, such as piggy banks, salt and pepper shakers, ashtrays, gravy boats, pitchers, jewelry boxes, as well as memorabilia adorned with decorative pig motifs. The objects likely date between 1900 and 2013 and, as indicated by various stamps, labels, inscriptions, and crests, originate from the United States, parts of Europe and Asia.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York University Stern School of Business Collection of Pig Memorabilia was discovered by university facility workers in a crawl space under the auditorium of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business.  The creator and donor of the collection are unknown. Stamps, labels, inscriptions, and crests on individual objects indicate that the assembled collection originates from all over the world, from regions of the United States, from parts of Asia, and from several countries in Europe.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Provenance unknown. The accession number associated with this transfer from the New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business is 13.019.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">According to a May 12, 2013 New York Times article by Edna Ishayik "Little Pigs, Little Pigs, Let Us In On Your History," New York University facility workers discovered the collection in a crawl space under the auditorium of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business. Paul Affuso, an associate dean at the business school, stated the collection may have been a gift to the undergraduate college, given by an alumna who had collected them during her lifetime as a hobby. A December 27, 1993 Chicago Tribune article "For some College Gifts, Even the Thought May Not Count," by Frank James suggests that a male donor and his family gifted the collection. </field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Under Affuso's direction, the collection was moved to a supply closet in the business school's Tisch Hall. The objects were unpacked and placed on bookshelves, where they remained for a few years. Professional movers were called by the facilities team to consolidate the collection, although a few figurines were pulled from the closet to show a reporter back in April 2013. It is unclear how long the boxes remained in the closet or if they were stored in another location prior to being transferred to the University Archives.</field>
