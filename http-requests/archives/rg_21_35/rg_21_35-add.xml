    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of the Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Institute, dated 1994-2015, document the activities of the Institute from its founding in 1996 and reflect student events, faculty affairs and collaboration with the A/P/A studies program.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Institute was founded in 1996. The Institute is focused on community and intercultural studies within a broad, rigorous international and comparative framework.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The A/P/A Institute produces public events and symposia for the larger New York University and New York City communities. The Institute brings together accomplished scholars, community builders, and artists from New York City and beyond for events throughout the year, including conferences, seminars, book readings, film screenings, musical performances, and brown bag lunches. The Institute also co-sponsors events with student and community organizations, which complement the academic programs offered by the University and address the needs of the community at large.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The A/P/A has collaborated on several events and activities with the Office for African American, Latino, and Asian American Student Services (OASIS). OASIS was created in 1988 in response to the expressed needs of students of color for more University administrative support and commitment. Today the mission of OASIS continues to be carried out by the Center for Multicultural Education and Programs (CMEP) at NYU.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The A/P/A Institute also reached out to youth in New York City through the Asian Pacific American Youth Alliance (APAYA) from 1994-2008. This was a free program led by A/P/A and community volunteers throughout the school year that sought to support and encourage high school youth to become community leaders. These students learned about and taught others about the vibrant and diverse Asian Pacific American history, cultures, and experiences. Their weekly meetings throughout the school year culminated in a forum at NYU planned and led by APAYA students. </field>
