    <field name="abstract_teim">This collection consists of a time capsule assembled in the early 1960s by members of the Perstare et Praestare Society, an academic honor society for NYU students at the University Heights Campus. The collection includes the titanium time capsule container as well as the items selected for inclusion. These items include a variety of NYU-produced publications, course syllabi, audio recordings, and ephemera documenting the different student populations, extracurricular student activities such as student productions of dramatic works, and notable campus events such as commencement. The collection also reflects the larger political climate of the early 1960s, through materials like election leaflets, publications concerning the John F. Kennedy presidential administration and his assassination, and ephemera from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) documenting on-campus civil rights. This collection also includes numerous programs for ceremonies for the Hall of Fame of Great Americans, an outdoor sculpture garden on campus featuring portrait busts of noted artists, intellectuals, and politicians.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">This time capsule was assembled through the efforts of multiple people. David Fleischmann (UC '60), convened a committee of members of the Perstare et Praestare Society, an academic honor society for NYU students, to select the objects included in the time capsule. Dr. John P. Nielsen of the department of metallurgy and materials sciences assisted the committee, and Dr. Harold Margolin, professor of metallurgical engineering, designed the time capsule itself. The time capsule was made of titanium and filled with helium before being sealed. It was buried in 1964 on the University Heights campus although more specific information concerning when and where the burial took place has not yet been recorded.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Documentation concerning the full chain of provenance for this time capsule and the materials included in it is incomplete. The time capsule was identified as part of the New York University Archives collection in 1993; the accession number associated is 2017.008.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Access to audiovisual materials in this collection is available through digitized access copies. Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that have already been digitized are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room.</field>
