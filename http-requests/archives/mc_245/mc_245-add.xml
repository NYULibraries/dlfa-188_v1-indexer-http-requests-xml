    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the collection contains postcards depicting New York City landmarks as they appeared in the 1930s. Landmarks that are particularly well documented in the collection include the city's churches, bridges, museums, hotels, and theaters, as well as the Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, and the Washington Square Arch. There is a small number of photographs presumably taken by Otness during the same time period. Their subject matter is largely similar to that of the postcards in the collection: Washington Square Park is heavily featured, as is the RMS Queen Mary (which completed its first transatlantic voyage to New York in 1936), and the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Materials also include ephemera collected by Otness while studying at NYU.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Herman Robert Otness was born in Moscow, Idaho, in 1907. He attended New York University between 1935 and 1939, graduating with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the School of Education in 1939. It was during these years at NYU that Otness may have collected the postcards and took the photographs that make up this collection.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After graduating from NYU, Otness worked as the chief clinical psychologist at The Training School in Vineland, New Jersey. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In 1950 he accepted a position as associate professor of psychology at the University of Idaho, where he remained until his retirement in 1971. Otness died in Moscow, Idaho on April 21, 1995.</field>
