    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of materials displayed during the exhibit in 1993.  Most of the material has been mounted on panels that were used for the exhibit. The newspaper articles, photographs, and many of the handouts are duplicates of original material that is held at the University Archives. The dates of the duplicated material range from 1965 to 1971, though the bulk of the material used in the exhibit is from 1968. The only original documents included in this collection are located in the folders titled: SDS Pamphlets, Rampart Magazine, and Rampart Magazine Cover, all located in Box 2. Student groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Transcendental Students, the Peace and Freedom Party, and the Youth International Party (YIPPIE!) were vocal participants in the events that occurred at NYU during this time. The material in this collection reflects the actions of these student groups and documents significant events that occurred during this time. Box 3 consists of photocopied material of the exhibit panels and Washington Square Journal articles.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">1968 Revisited was an exhibit presented by the New York University Archives in October 1993. The exhibit highlights the radicalism that was prevalent at NYU during the late 1960s. The exhibit was divided into a timeline portion and a Who's Who section. The timeline documents the events that occurred both worldwide and at NYU between the years 1965-1971. The Who's Who portion covers different individuals and student organizations that were prominent during this time of strikes and upheaval. The majority of the information from both the timeline and the Who's Who section focuses on the events and actions of different individuals and groups in 1968. Topics discussed in the exhibit include the Vietnam War, Nixon's election, the Black Panthers, among many other controversial events and protests. The exhibit remembers groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society and the Transcendental Students who performed numerous sit-ins, strikes and other actions against the University administration.  Dates are included before and after 1968 allowing the viewer to get a full understanding of the causes and effects of the events that happened in 1968. A website created by Amy Surak, containing a digital version of the exhibit, is available through the New York University Archives website.</field>
