    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series of letters and missionary reports has been arranged alphabetically by author. Attention should be given to the following points. The dates of the folders are inclusive and do not indicate gaps in the papers. The relationship of individuals employed or otherwise affiliated with the AFCU is indicated in parenthesis after their names. The contents of Miscellaneous folders should not be overlooked; they frequently contain correspondence from members of the Board of Directors and officiating members of other organizations. If a correspondent has written in behalf of another organization, the papers are found under that corporate name. If the correspondent, who may perhaps be an agent of another agency, handwritten on his own behalf, the papers will be found under his name. In some cases both personal and corporate names should be consulted; for example, both Edward W. Hitchcock and Charles S. Robinson served as minister of the American Chapel in Paris and their letters should be considered with those in the American Chapel in Paris folder.</field>
