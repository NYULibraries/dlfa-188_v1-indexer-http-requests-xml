    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born in New York City, William R. Bryans (1884-1974) attended Manual Training High School in Brooklyn from 1895-1902 before attending New York University (NYU). He graduated NYU with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 1906 and achieved the degree of Mechanical Engineer in 1909. Less than a year after graduation, Bryans took his first job at NYU, where he continued to work for over four decades in many capacities, including as a Professor of Engineering Mechanics, the Secretary of Faculty, and Assistant Dean. In 1949 he was named Professor Emeritus and was granted an Honorary Doctorate in Engineering. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During his academic career Bryans published several papers on the mechanics of materials and engineering education. He also authored two books, Concise Mechanics of Materials and Mechanics of Internal Work in 1928 and Resistance of Materials in 1931.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Bryans was a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Association of University Professors, Iota Alpha, and the NYU Faculty Club. During World War I, Bryans served as Assistant Director in charge of instruction for the Student Army Training Corps from 1917-1918.</field>
