    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I contains the earliest material in the collection and is mostly correspondence. The bulk of the series spans the years 1900-1940, covering Courant's time as a young student to his immigration to the U.S., but also includes files from around the time of his death. The series contains materials on Courant's schooling in Germany, including diplomas, certificates and records of his coursework as well as documents from his time in the German Army during World War I. These include trench maps and a certificate for a war service medal. Much of the series consists of correspondence with colleagues at the University of Göttingen, their articles and dissertations. The letters pertain to mathematics at Göttingen, the effects of the Nazi regime on academia and mathematics and other personal matters. Courant's move from Germany to the U.S. is also documented in this series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some material in Series I was used by Courant biographer Constance Reid. This is indicated by folder-level notes.</field>
