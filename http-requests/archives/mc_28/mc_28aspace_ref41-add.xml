    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: World War II Record, 1943-1955, is arranged alphabetically by content and is concerned with alumni and former employees who served in the armed services during World War II. It contains military correspondence between Jones and former employees and students in the service during World War II showing Dr. Jones' concern with creating a scrapbook detailing the activities of university servicemen during the war. This concern evolved into the creation of a photographic war memorial to alumni who were war-related casualties. His correspondence with university officials seeking funding and appropriate space for the memorial and correspondence with the friends and relatives of the deceased demonstrate his efforts in creating this memorial. The folders also include photographs of the servicemen and letters from families expressing their appreciation.</field>
