    <field name="bioghist_teim">Theodore Francis Jones was born in Dover, Massachusetts on December 5, 1885. After graduation from the Boston Latin School, he proceeded to Harvard, where he received his A.B. in 1906. During the next year, he studied at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. From 1908-1910, he was an assistant in History at Harvard and received his Ph.D. from that institution in 1910. He joined the Department of History at New York University as an instructor in 1910 and was assistant professor, 1912-1920, associate professor, 1920-1924, and professor, 1924-1951. In addition, he served as Director of the University Heights Library from 1925-1948. From 1917-1921, Professor Jones was a lieutenant in the Naval Reserves and in 1918 he served as Assistant Naval Attaché in Madrid.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jones' most important publication was New York University, 1832-1932, published in 1933 as part of NYU's Centennial Celebration. He was also the author of Land Ownership in Brookline, Mass. (1923), and co-author (with Professor Richard Davis Mallory) of a centennial memoir entitled The Presidents of the Beta of N.Y. Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, published in 1958. Although he never chose to publish his findings, Jones was recognized by many scholars as one of the leading experts on Venetian trade with England in the later Middle Ages.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Upon his retirement in 1951, Jones was awarded an honorary degree by New York University. He died on November 18, 1968.</field>
