    <field name="bioghist_teim">The blog (http://admissionsblog.nyu.edu/) was established in December 2012 to attract new students to the university and help adjust them to NYU life. The website redirected to https://meet.nyu.edu/ in late 2019.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">http://admissionsblog.nyu.edu/ was initially selected by curators as part of the Student Blogs Archive-it Collection. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2019, http://admissionsblog.nyu.edu/ redirected to https://meet.nyu.edu/. The accession number associated with this website is 2020.019.</field>
