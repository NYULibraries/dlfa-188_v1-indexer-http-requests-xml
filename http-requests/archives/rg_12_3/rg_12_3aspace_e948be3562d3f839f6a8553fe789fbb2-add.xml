    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes websites related to undergraduate admissions to attract new students to the university and help adjust them to NYU life. The blog (http://admissionsblog.nyu.edu/) was established in December 2012 and consisted mostly of announcement posts for programming offered by the admissions department as well as deadlines and admissions decisions. In early 2013, articles began being published related to NYU welcome week, student experiences in New York City, jobs, internships, classes, study abroad, residential life, clubs, student government, and application advice. The blog was written by staff and students. In late 2019, the blog stopped being published and the website redirected to https://meet.nyu.edu/. Meet NYU is a blog produced by New York University Admissions intended to aid students in the application process by educating them about resources and providing advice. It includes videos and posts on application advice, information on campus resources, city life, communities and clubs, athletics, civic engagement, academics, study abroad, research, faculty, the Washington Square and Downtown Brooklyn campuses.</field>
