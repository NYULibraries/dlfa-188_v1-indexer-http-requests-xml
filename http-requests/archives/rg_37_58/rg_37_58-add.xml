    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Records of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) consist of materials documenting lectures, receptions, and other events held by ISAW between 2007 and 2018, including newspaper clippings, newsletters, press releases, posters, pamphlets, and publications.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains the website for the Society for Classical Studies. Roger Bagnall, the Leon Levy Director of ISAW from 2007-2016, was president of SCS in 2016 and likely the reason this website is included in the record group.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) was founded in 2006 by a gift from the Leon Levy Foundation to New York University. ISAW offers doctoral, postdoctoral, and visiting scholar programs that promote cross disciplinary approaches to the study of the ancient world. The institute advocates for the study of the ancient civilizations through exhibitions, lectures, publications, and public events.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Transferred by Alex Van from the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World in August 2018. The accession numbers associated with this gift are 2018.041 and 2019.040.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">https://classicalstudies.org/ was likely selected by curators in 2017 at the end of Roger Bagnall's (Leon Levy Director of ISAW from 2007-2016) term as president of SCS, through the use of Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2022, crawling was discontinued.</field>
