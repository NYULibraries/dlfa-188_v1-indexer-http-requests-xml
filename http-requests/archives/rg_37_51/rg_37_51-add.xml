This collection consists of 183 video files and five image files of Center events and performances between 2014 and 2017. Events documented in this collection include seminars, lectures, demonstrations, presentations, and performances by students, faculty, and guests, including filmmaker Frederick Wiseman; Heather Watts, former principal ballerina for the New York City Ballet; choreographer and former ballet dancer Alexei Ratmansky; and former dancer and entrepreneur John Michael Schert. Most of the events took place in New York University classroom or performance spaces. Events focused on a variety of topics relating to dance history, practice, and innovative performance.</field>
