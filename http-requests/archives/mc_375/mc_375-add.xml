    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains websites related to student organizations and activities at New York University, the bulk of which come from 2013-2015. Blogs and other websites cover news from around the university and New York City, as well as advice for current and prospective students. Some websites cover events that student organization put together, as well as NYU student organizations in the news. News coverage includes topics such as NYU Greek life, NYU alumni, the Objectivist Club, and LGBTQIA+ community. Events include music and theater performances, club meetings, fundraisers, and conferences. There are many Facebook pages in this collection, modelled off websites and blogs such as Craigslist Missed Connections, Humans of New York, or Overheard in New York but about NYU and its students.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">This collection was created by the University Archives in 2013 to collect a sampling of student organization activities in the mid 2010s. The websites in the collection were derived from club lists found at the Office of Student Affairs, yearbooks, and Google search results.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Websites were initially selected by Aleksandr Gelfand from September 2013-January 2014 through the use of Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Archived websites are made accessible for purposes of education and research. NYU Libraries have given attribution to rights holders when possible; however, due to the nature of archival collections, we are not always able to identify this information.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">If you hold the rights to materials in our archived websites that are unattributed, please let us know so that we may maintain accurate information about these materials.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">If you are a rights holder and are concerned that you have found material on this website for which you have not granted permission (or is not covered by a copyright exception under US copyright laws), you may request the removal of the material from our site by submitting a notice, with the elements described below, to the special.collections@nyu.edu.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Please include the following in your notice:  Identification of the material that you believe to be infringing and information sufficient to permit us to locate the material; your contact information, such as an address, telephone number, and email address; a statement that you are the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed and that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and made under penalty of perjury; and your physical or electronic signature.  Upon receiving a notice that includes the details listed above, we will remove the allegedly infringing material from public view while we assess the issues identified in your notice.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Robots.txt (a piece of code designed to limit crawler activity within a website) was ignored. FourSquare was blocked from capture.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content. Full-Text searches of archived websites are available at https://archive-it.org/organizations/567.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Facebook is inconsistently captured and plays back. Majority of 2022 Facebook crawls were performed with Webrecorder to resolve capture problems from initial captures.</field>
