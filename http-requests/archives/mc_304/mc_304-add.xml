    <field name="bioghist_teim">Although the earliest yearbook in this collection dates to 1887, the University did not start regularly producing yearbooks until the 1890s. The University's various component schools started issuing yearbooks for their own student bodies starting in the early 20th century. Through the 1930s, many of the yearbooks were produced by the Junior class. As of 2019, NYU is no longer producing yearbooks.</field>
