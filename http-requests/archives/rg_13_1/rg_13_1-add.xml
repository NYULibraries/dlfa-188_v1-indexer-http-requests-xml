    <field name="bioghist_teim">The NYU Medical Center was established to expand NYU's overall program of medical education, research, and patient care. It combined the existing University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College with additional resources to meet its mission of educating physicians, conducting scientific research, and treating patients. In 1941, at the time of its 100th anniversary, a vision and a plan for the School of Medicine's development came from two young faculty members: Donal Sheehan, Professor of Anatomy and Acting Dean, and Howard C. Taylor, Jr., Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Their vision came together in a 1945 report to the University called "The Mission of a Medical School," which called for worthy and adequate buildings, a program of graduate education, expansion of the activities of the university, close proximity to Bellevue Hospital, flexibility and individuality in learning, and confidence in research. By 1947 a site for the new Medical Center had been chosen and the following details completed: the University was granted a charter to establish and operate a hospital and clinic; the University formally established the New York University-Bellevue Medical Center, with its own Board; the University acquired 11 acres of land between First Avenue and the East River Drive and from 30th to 34th streets, and engaged architects; and the City agreed to close streets in the area and transfer title to the University, for which the University agreed to exchange a parcel of land for construction of an Institute of Forensic Medicine. Also by 1947 $6.5 million had been raised. Units of the Medical Center then sprang up in the following order: Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (1951); Medical Science Building and the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Institute (1955); Hall of Residence and Alumni Hall (1957); and University Hospital (1963).</field>
