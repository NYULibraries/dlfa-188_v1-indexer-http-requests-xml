    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2.0 linear feet (4 boxes). Arranged in order of presentation (see conference programs, Box 16, Folder 1). Although some Mss. titles differ from those listed in the conference programs, this series consists of original conference manuscripts. Highlights include the opening remarks by Vera D. Rubin (see Folder 3), original art work, the closing address by former prime minister Michael Manley and papers associated with the award ceremony. Based on the correspondence and tally sheets in this series, some Mss. were revised or formalized after the conference for publication. Several Mss. were not submitted.</field>
