    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"Minutes" correspond to "Annals," "General Minutes," "Council Minutes," "Club Manual," and "The Book of the Poker."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Annals (1907-12) were an early version of the general minutes and contain treasury reports, a 1912 statement of policy, minutes of the meetings, etc. The Annals also contain a poem sent to the club by "The New Yorker" (an NYU literary club), which pokes fun at the Andiron journal's ("Colonnade") obfuscations of the founding fathers. Judging from the dates, this volume represents the first volume of the general minutes which hereafter begin "Volume II, Volume III etc..." (See Box 3)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The General Minutes, 1912-43 are volumes containing meticulous records of club meetings: what was discussed, news about members, treasury reports (although the Council Minutes would be the best place to investigate financial matters), news about poetry readings, recitals, lectures, summations of lectures and rebuttals, announcements concerning dinners (such as "Ladies' Night"), annual events, reunions, letters from members and non-members from abroad; and general club business such as the creation of new rules, the voting in of new members, credentials of potential members, and the bestowal of membership upon professors of foreign Universities. (Boxes l, 5-10)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Council Minutes 1926-43 contains membership tables and comparative financial statements. Of special interest, the last page of volume IV contains a page-long reference to the War Powers Act of 1938 and its subsequent interpretation by the club. (Boxes 3-4)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Club Manual 1914 contains the club constitution, by-laws, club roster, and a statement of purpose (i.e. to publish the "Colonnade" and to affirm Romantic Idealism). Also there are two lists of Andiron Club members, plus a list of club publications (that is, articles published by club members). This kind of list is crucial for a researcher trying to trace literary sentiments. (Box 10)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Book of the Poker 1913 is a handwritten document (probably written by Henry Melville Love) that, in part, notes attitudes of members toward each other and toward literary criticism in general. Written in high prose and verse by the mysterious "Poker," it underpins the intimacy of the Andiron Club. Among other things, the "Poker" contains a defense of Romantic Idealism, while refusing to acknowledge the so-called "decadent" art movement as valid or pure. (Box 10)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The club Bibliography 1907-40 lists some of the publications of its members. (Box 10)</field>
