    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The last series in the collection consists of a few photographs thatwere found dispersed in the collection, several newspaper clippings on subjects in which Dr.Lamarsh apparently had an interest and two taped recordings of a Breeder Technology Seminar,which he conducted in 1981. SUMMARY The Lamarsh Papers contain a great deal of valuableinformation for the researcher. The series Consulting Services provides a wealth of informationabout Dr. Lamarsh's work as a consultant to various agencies and reflects his nuclear energypolicies. It includes studies and reports on research projects which he undertook for governmentand private agencies. The material documenting Dr. Lamarsh's work on advisory committees alsoreflects his attitudes towards several nuclear energy issues. Although the series Research Interestsis not particularly rich, it may suggest the wide variety of subjects in which Lamarsh took aninterest and it may also provide information as to how his research interests evolved during hiscareer. Regardless of his long tenure at New York University and the Polytechnic Institute ofNew York, the material in the series Academic Affiliations is not very extensive. It may,however, give the researcher a perspective of Dr. Lamarsh's involvement as an educator, as theseries on Professional Associations may provide a perspective of his activities in variousprofessional societies. The series on Publications and Speeches may suggest Dr. Lamarsh's senseof obligation to educate people about nuclear energy as well his concern with contemporaryattitudes towards nuclear issues. The Lamarsh Papers offer a rich resource for those interested inthe history of nuclear physics, in general, and in the career and point of view of a worldrenowned physicist in particular.</field>
