    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includesthree subseries: Books, Other Publications and Proposed Publications. The subseries "Books"documents Dr. Lamarsh's two major publications: Introduction to Nuclear Reactor Theory(1966)and Introduction to Nuclear Engineering (1975). Aside from such technical matters asobtaining permission to use another's work, this subseries consists of correspondence with thepublishing company, some preliminary research material, comments on the two books andmaterial concerning second editions and translations. The subseries "Other Publications" includescopies of various editorials and articles penned by Dr. Lamarsh at various points during hisillustrious career. "Proposed Publications" consists of material, such as handwritten manuscriptsor typescripts that suggests Dr. Lamarsh's interest in publishing certain works which, for onereason or another, were not realized during his lifetime. The four works are: "The Elements ofNuclear Reactor Theory," "Nuclear Engineering Tables," "People, Power and Pollution: AnIntroduction to the Environmental Aspects of Electric Power Production," and "Radiation: OurUnseen Environment." "People, Power and Pollution" was apparently based on a non creditcourse which Dr. Lamarsh gave at New York University during the 1971-72 academic year.</field>
