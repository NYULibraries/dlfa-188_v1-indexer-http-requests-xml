    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The materials contained in this collection are strong in highlighting the ideas, ideals, and philosophy of Newsom as expressed in his many academic and corporate roles, but offer little original information with regard to his tenure as President of New York University. The collection is divided into five main series, as well as a supplementary photo collection which is located in the greater photo collection(see Cross-Reference sheet for further information regarding the Newsom photos.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains no administrative records of Dr. Newsom, either while President of New York University or in any of his subsequent positions. The inclusive dates of the collection are 1924 to 1986.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Carroll Newsom (1904-1990) graduated from the College of Emporia, Kansas in 1924, receiving his A.B. degree in mathematics. Newsom became an instructor of mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1927, the institution from which he received his M.A. in 1927 and PhD. in 1931. Reworking the traditional mathematics curriculum of the university, Newsom had become a full professor and department chairman in five years.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During World War II, Newsom took a position as Chairman of the Science Division at Oberlin College. Newsom had already written about both the positive and negative potential of atomic energy in "An American Philosophy of Education." During one meeting with President Truman, Newsom advised the new President to continue with the Manhattan Project.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">At the war's end, Newsom and two other American doctors helped to reorganize medical education in France, for which Newsom was later awarded the French Legion of Honor. Taking leave of Oberlin in 1948, Newsom moved on to New York, where he took the post of Assistant Commissioner of Higher Education in 1948. As Associate Commissioner from 1950 to 1955, Newsom contributed to the development of the state university system.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Newsom's last stop on the educational trail was at New York University, first as Executive Vice President from 1955 to 1956, then as President from 1956 to 1962 (his resignation took effect on January 1, 1962). During his tenure as President, NYU's assets "increased from $111 million to $178 million." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Newsom moved on to the Senior Vice President slot at Prentice-Hall, becoming president and director of the publishing firm in 1964. Newsom left the presidency of the firm in 1965, only one year after having taken the position. His resignation was partially prompted by the failure of RCA (of which Newsom was a Director) in its attempt to merge with Prentice-Hall. For the next three years (1966 to 1969), Newsom held the post of vice-president for education at RCA, a position which permitted further work in the field of educational television.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">One of Newsom's foremost concerns was the educational potential of television, which Newsom glimpsed at the very germination of the new medium in the early 1950's. His ideas were set forth "A Television Policy for Education" (1952). Newsom's other interests included religious history and mathematics. Throughout his career, Newsom authored 9 books and was awarded 24 honorary degrees. He died February 3, 1990 in Dublin.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The University Archives acquired the six linear feet of material contained in this collection in April 1991. The documents were sent by Dr. Newsom's son, Walter Newsom, and accepted by Theresa Taylor, at the time acting head of the University Archives.</field>
