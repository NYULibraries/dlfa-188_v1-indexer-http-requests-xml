    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Soul of Reason (SoR) was a half-hour, talk-show format radio show that aired from 1971-1986 as a result of a collaboration between the commercial radio station WNBC and New York University's station WNYU. The host of the program, Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Jr. was also the Director of the Institute of Afro-American Affairs (IAAA) at NYU at the time. The show's mission was to be "a showcase for Black scholarshipâ€¦.to examine the foundations of African-American thought from a variety of areas," according to founding documents for the show. During each episode, Brown conducted an informal, back and forth dialogue with a variety of professionals, mainly from the New York City area, who spoke personally to the unique challenges of the Black experience. These shows initially aired at 10pm and 12am on WNBC and rebroadcast a few weeks later on WNYU.</field>
