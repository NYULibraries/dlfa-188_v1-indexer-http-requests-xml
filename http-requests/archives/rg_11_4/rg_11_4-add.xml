    <field name="abstract_teim">The position of University Architect was created in 1924, first held by Professor Fiske Kimball (1888-1955). He continued in the position of University Architect on a part-time basis for thirty years, until his death in 1955. The position was revived in 1960 with the hiring of Joseph J. Roberto, a 1935 graduate of New York University's School of Architecture. Roberto had been a practicing architect in New York for twelve years, specializing in institutional buildings. Anticipating increasing enrollments in the 1960s, the NYU administration believed that circumstances demanded the appointment of a full-time architect whose responsibilities included the handling of programming, real estate, mechanical services, use and site planning, and architectural design matters. In 1977, Joseph Roberto retired upon reaching mandatory retirement age and the post was discontinued. Roberto continued to consult for the university, however, through the mid-1980s.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of the Office of the University Architect/Joseph J. Roberto span the years 1928-1987, with the bulk of the material covering the period 1960-1987. These records delineate the activities of Roberto=s office and those of the Director of Planning and Supervising Architect, Martin Beck (1961-1966), whose office records Roberto assumed upon Beck=s departure. Primary correspondents include top university officials like the President, financial officers within the university, officials in the Plant and Properties office and other departments responsible for the school=s physical plant, deans and faculty members, architects, engineers, contractors and consultants, city and neighborhood leaders, and professional colleagues.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection documents one of the periods of New York University's most prolific physical expansion. During the 1960s the university erected a number of major structures at the Washington Square, University Heights, and other university centers, including Philip Johnson's Bobst library, I. M. Pei's University Towers, the Technology II Building, and the award-winning Warren Weaver Hall. Though New York University=s building program stalled in the 1970s as the school experienced a financial crisis (which necessitated the sale of the University Heights campus), several more modest projects were completed that decade and in early 1980s , such as the Hagop Kevorkian Center. The Roberto Collection illustrates these building efforts in great detail, documenting construction projects, alterations of extant buildings (including the renovations of historic buildings like the Washington Square North row houses), and proposed structures never ultimately built. Space planning for the university, one of Roberto's chief responsibilities, represents another major topic covered by the records.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The university's strategic plans for its physical layout are also revealed by this collection. For example, several files deal with Philip Johnson's unrealized arcade-style plan for the Washington Square Campus in the early 1960s. New York University=s building initiatives affected the surrounding neighborhoods, and consequently the records of the University Architect include material on issues like zoning and urban renewal. Also included are records relating to historic preservation and restoration activities (in which Roberto was deeply involved ) at NYU, in New York City, and elsewhere. Among Roberto's projects documented in the collection are the renovation of the Old Merchant's House and the rehabilitation of Washington Square Park.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Though the collection is most comprehensive in its coverage of New York University's physical growth after 1960, the year in which Roberto assumed the office of University Architect, it also contains some material related to initiatives undertaken from the 1920s through the 1950s, such as the construction of the Loeb Student Center. Documentation is most extensive through the late 1960s. The quantity of records is smaller for the years leading up to and following Roberto's retirement in 1977 (after which he worked on a consulting basis), but nevertheless provides a good picture of the university's building program in that period.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The position of University Architect was created in 1924 with the designation of Professor Fiske Kimball (1888-1955) as such. Kimball had joined NYU's faculty in 1922 as a lecturer on art in the school's Extramural division. The following year was named Morse Professor of the Literature of the Arts of Design and took charge of the newly-created Department of Fine Arts. As University Architect, Kimball advised the school on architectural matters such as the development of the University Heights campus and the design of the law school center in the late 1940s. While he resigned his professorship in 1925 to take the post of director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, he continued in the position of University Architect on a part-time basis for thirty years, until his death in 1955.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The position was revived in 1960 with the hiring of Joseph J. Roberto. Expansion of the university's academic and research programs had spurred significant building activity in the 1950s, Loeb Student Center and the Medical Center among the projects undertaken. Anticipating increasing enrollments in the 1960s, NYU's plans for the decade ahead included further physical development. The administration believed that such a program demanded the appointment of a full-time architect to determine immediate needs and anticipate potential growth. The responsibilities of the University Architect position, one of only about thirty in the nation, included the handling of programming, real estate, mechanical services, use and site planning, and architectural design matters. In this new post, Roberto's functions were to set aesthetic standards and to make recommendations for the selection of outside architects. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Joseph Roberto had graduated from New York University's School of Architecture in 1935. After serving as a major in the Air Force in World War II, Roberto practiced architecture in New York for twelve years, specializing in institutional buildings. His first professional involvement with the university came in 1951, when he was engaged to design the School of Retailing's facilities in the Main Building.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Roberto originally reported to Vice President of Business Affairs George F. Baughman, but by September 1961 had been transferred to the office of Charles R. Cox, head of the university's capital development program. Later that autumn the position of University Architect was moved under the auspices of a new office, that of the Director of Planning and Supervising Architect, which was created by President Carroll V. Newsom. Baughman and Chancellor George Stoddard had proposed the new position, which was given the responsibility for developing and presenting the university's building program, working with administrative and faculty committees, and acting as a liaison with architectural firms. The administration engaged Martin L. Beck for the post. An architect in private and associated practice, Beck had developed expansion plans for several universities, including Long Island University, where he had worked with James Hester. Beck was responsible for making recommendations relating to budgets, the selection of outside architects and engineers, and space utilization matters. Beck supervised the University Architect's execution of duties involving the latter. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The position of Director of Planning and Supervising Architect was discontinued upon Beck's retirement in 1966. After that point Beck served as Consulting Architect to the Office of the Chancellor and Executive Vice President. After 1968, Roberto reported to Director of Planning and Construction Joseph Schober, within the Office of the Vice President for Institutional Facilities, but by the mid-1970s the Office of the University Architect again functioned independently. In 1977 Joseph Roberto retired upon reaching mandatory retirement age and the post was discontinued. Roberto continued to consult for the university, however, through the mid-1980s.</field>

Martin Beck, who held the latter position, passed his correspondence on to Roberto on a daily basis and transferred files to Roberto upon vacating the position.</field>
