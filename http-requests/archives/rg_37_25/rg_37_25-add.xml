    <field name="abstract_teim">The Town Hall, a musical venue in New York City, has its roots in late 19th century political activism. Founded as the League for Political Education, the Town Hall served primarily as a forum for political speakers in the early 20th century before shifting focus to performance midcentury.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The administrative series in this collection contains files on Town Hall's buildings as well as some budget and fundraising material. The collection includes legal correspondence and papers such certificates of occupancy, trademark, mortgage and tax documents. A variety of programs from more than 70 years of lectures and performances held at Town Hall are included in this collection. It also contains photographs of Town Hall performers and early members, and clippings and internally produced materials related to the history of the organization. The Town Hall disseminated several publications including a newsletter, The Town Crier; Enduring Names, biographies of notable individuals who had endowed lecture series at Town Hall; and other promotional publications. Issues of these publications can be found in the collection. Correspondence from Town Hall Director Lawrence Zucker from 1981 to 1985, audio reels of lectures, and bound biographies of League of Political Education founders are included in the papers as well.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also includes four scrapbooks. Two contain materials related to the production of "America's Town Meeting of the Air," a political forum broadcasted from Town Hall for more than 20 years, the third is comprised of membership materials and the fourth contains League of Political Education material from the beginning of the 20th century.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some materials relate to events, such as "America's Town Meeting of the Air." They also address topics including Town Hall's 1958 merger with NYU, the purchase of 123 West 43rd Street and the purchase and sale of the adjacent Town Hall Annex and construction projects. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Notes related to a 1978 survey of the collection that were found among the Town Hall papers have been included in this collection. They are in Series VIII - Related Materials.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Town Hall Inc. was organized as the League for Political Education in 1894 by six prominent New York women after a suffrage measure was defeated in the New York State Legislature. The purpose of the league was to educate the public about the issue by holding educational programs and lectures. The events were held at small rented venues. The League for Political Education gave birth to offshoot groups such as the Economic Club and Civic Forum. In 1904 the League became incorporated and changed its name to the Board of Trustees of the League for Political Education.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The building of an auditorium for the League for Political Education began in 1919 as the organization outgrew its small venues and sought a permanent home. The structure, which also included office space, was designed by architecture firm McKim, Mead and White. It opened January 1921 at 123 W. 43rd Street. It was dubbed the Town Meeting Hall. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Soon after the doors opened to lecturers and audiences, it was realized the auditorium had exceptional acoustics. And so the Town Meeting Hall became a venue for musical performance as well as political expression. Independent groups such as the New York University Club also rented space from the organization.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1930 the League for Political Education purchased the adjacent the building at 125 W. 43rd Street for its Town Hall Annex for more space. It subsequently sold the building in 1959. The league began hosting and broadcasting its "America's Town Meeting of the Air" radio lecture series in 1935. The series ran until 1956 and provided a forum for political and cultural experts to discuss current events issues.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The organization changed its name to The Town Hall, Inc. in 1937 to reflect its expanding programming. In the late 1950s Town Hall experienced a decline. It merged with New York University in 1958 and came under the jurisdiction of the Division of General Education (now the School of Continuing Education) until 1978 when the university divested itself from the organization.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Town Hall remains primarily a musical venue focusing on jazz and arts education. </field>
