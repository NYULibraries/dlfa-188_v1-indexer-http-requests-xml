    <field name="abstract_teim">Engelbert Schücking (1926-2015) was a physics professor at New York University whose research interests included theoretical astrophysics, general relativity, and cosmology. Schücking was born in Hörde, Germany and  studied mathematics and physics at the University of Münster, and later at Göttingen. He worked with German physicist Pascual Jordan in Hamburg in 1952, and earned his PhD there in 1955.He moved to the United States in 1961, and held research and teaching positions at Syracuse University, Cornell University, and the University of Texas at Austin. In 1967, he was appointed as Professor of Physics at New York University. This collection consists of audio reel recordings of Engelbert Schucking as part of New York University's Sunrise Semester, and a copy of the 2015 book  Einstein's Apple by Engelbert Schücking and Eugene J. Surowitz.</field>
