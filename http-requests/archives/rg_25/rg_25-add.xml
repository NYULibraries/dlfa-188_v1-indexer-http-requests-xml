    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York College of Dentistry was established in 1865 in a small rental space on 22nd Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The mission of the College was to promote altruism in dentistry while providing first-rate education. Upon its inception, the school had 31 students and 10 faculty members. Only 9 of the original 31 students graduated in the first graduating class. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">When the New York College of Dentistry merged with New York University in 1925, it became known as the New York University College of Dentistry. The merger led to the creation of a dental school at the forefront of research and postdoctoral education.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Today, the College of Dentistry has approximately 1,600 students from across the world. About fifty percent of the student body is female, and fifty percent are minority students. The greater aim of the College is to improve the health of underserved populations, and more generally, to improve health worldwide. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York University College of Dentistry offers D.D.S., B.S. and A.A.S. degrees. It is now the third oldest and the largest private dental school in the United States.</field>
