    <field name="bioghist_teim">John J. O'Connor first came to NYU in 1981 with incoming NYU President John Brademas, for whom he had worked as press secretary and special assistant on Capitol Hill. O'Connor assumed two positions at the university. He served as Executive Assistant to the President and worked under Naomi Levine, Vice President for External Affairs. The Office of External Affairs was responsible for the management and planning of all fundraising, public relations, and alumni programs. The duties of the office included the supervision of the Alumni Federation and the Office of University Development, which was concerned with fundraising activities designed to secure financial support form private sources. The Vice President also supervised the activities of the Office of Public Affairs, which operated the University Press Office, the Office of Advertising and Publications, which included the Photographic Department, and Reprographic Services.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1988, NYU reorganized several administrative offices "to meet the challenges of the next stage of advance of the University." As part of this reorganization, O'Connor became Vice President for University Relations. In this position he became responsible for all federal, state, and community relations, public affairs, special events and Commencement, alumni relations, and writing, research and editorial services. O'Connor continued as Executive Assistant to the President.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1996, O'Connor became acting vice chancellor at the State University of New York.</field>
