    <field name="appraisal_teim">In December 2020 the following were identified as candidates for deaccessioning and were removed from the collection: off-air recording of PBS' Independent Lens, a video introduction for a Chilean drama school, duplicates of Sunrise Semester recordings from Landy's class (not off-air recordings, the original footage), raw footage of healing ceremony in Korea, and video outtakes of play practice and scenes around a theatre.  These were removed from the collection because they were materials to which the University Archives could not provide access to, of little or no research value, not related to the collection, or were duplicative material.</field>
