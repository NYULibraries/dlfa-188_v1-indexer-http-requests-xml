    <field name="bioghist_teim">Harold Oliver Voorhis (1896-1985) served as the first Secretary of New York University (NYU). Born on July 29, 1896, in Kokomo, Indiana, Voorhis received his B.S. from Colgate University in 1919. In 1920 he studied at Columbia University Law School and in 1922 earned an M.A. in Economics from New York University. In 1945 he was awarded an honorary LL.D. from Colgate University.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">From 1914 to 1915 Voorhis worked as a surveyor's assistant in Saskatchewan, Canada. From 1916 to 1919 he served as the secretary to the President of Colgate University, and he also served as secretary to the Chautauqua Institution in 1919. In 1920 Voorhis moved to New York City and took a position as secretary to the Vice President of the National Bank of Commerce. Voorhis began his administrative career at New York University as executive secretary to Chancellor Elmer Ellsworth Brown. Voorhis also taught economics at NYU during this time period. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During Voorhis' tenure the Secretary served as the Chancellor's principal assistant. Voorhis served in six administrations: Elmer Ellsworth Brown (1911-1933), Harry Woodburn Chase (1933-51), James Loomis Madden (acting Chancellor from 1951-1952), Henry Townley Heald (1952-1956), Carroll Vincent Newsom (1956-1962), and James McNaughton Hester (1962-1975).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The University grew tremendously during this time period, and the scope of responsibilities of the office of the Secretary reflected this growth. In 1945 Voorhis became the Vice Chancellor and Secretary under Chancellor Harry Woodburn Chase. In 1955 he was named Vice President and Secretary during Henry T. Heald's presidency. Over time the office supervised a wide array of functions, including serving as Clerk of the Council/Trustees and Secretary of the Senate. The office also handled the planning of public ceremonies, including commencement, and oversaw various other offices, including the Bureau of Public Information, the Student Activities Office, the New York University Press, ROTC, and the New York University Art Collection. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Voorhis retired in 1962 after 42 years of service to New York University. </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Office of Vice President and Secretary at New York University (NYU) was first created as the Office of the Secretary of the University in 1925. The Secretary was appointed by the Council, upon recommendation of the Chancellor, and served as the general executive assistant to the Chancellor. The Office of Secretary became central to the administration of the University.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The primary function of the Secretary was to assist the Chancellor in the discharge of his duties. The responsibilities delineated in 1925 included: conducting correspondence with individuals and institutions relating to the University at large; coordinating the work of secretaries of the several schools and divisions; preparing and maintaining minutes, documentary materials, records, and conducting correspondence of the Council and its committees. The Secretary affixed the University seal and maintained records of diplomas and certificates issued by the University.  He maintained personnel records of the faculty, published the University bibliography, supervised the publication of annual reports, and performed other administrative duties assigned by the Chancellor.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The responsibilities of the Secretary increased in volume as the University grew. In recognition of the importance of the Secretary, the administrative title of the office was changed on July 1, 1945, to Vice Chancellor and Secretary in accordance with the duties assigned to the office by Chancellor Harry Woodburn Chase and the University Council. The title was changed again in 1955 to Vice President and Secretary as a result of a general administrative reorganization under President Henry T. Heald. Several assistants to the Secretary were hired in 1956. </field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The records of the Office of Vice President and Secretary during the Voorhis administration were transferred from the Secretary's Office to the New York University Archives in March 1975 by Dr. E. Frederic Knauth.  They were previously stored in Vanderbilt Hall, 40 Washington Square South, where the offices of central administration were located before moving to the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library in 1973.</field>
