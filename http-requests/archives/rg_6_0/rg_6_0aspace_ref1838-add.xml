    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The administrative records of Russell D. Niles measure 11 linear feet and span the years 1964-1966. The material has been processed into three chronological series representing each of the academic years of Niles' term, and a fourth series consists of administrative topics, Deans' Council minutes and mission statements originally set apart from the chronological series. The first series contains a small number of records from the final months of the George Stoddard administration. The third series, covering the academic year 1965-1966, was insufficiently processed by a student in the fall of 1987 and the finding aid to that series is not, in its present state, reliable. The excessive bulk in the Niles collection can be attributed, to a large extent, to the processing problems in series III. It must also be noted that the subseries on all-university departments in series II contains material spanning Niles' first two academic years, 1963-1964 and 1964-1965. Some files covering student grievances, the transfer of faculty members from one school to another, and specific faculty student relations are restricted. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In relation to the previous subgroups, Niles' records contain a substantial number of files composed of material on spaces and buildings (most notably in series III, subseries IV), reflecting the many proposed and actual physical changes taking place at NYU at this time. A file on the President of the University refers to NYU's attempt to acquire the Worlds Fair Spanish Pavilion and the Astor estate in Rhinebeck, New York. There are signs indicating the pending shutdown of the University Heights Campus and the subsequent need to strengthen Washington Square. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files record changes that resulted from the Self-Study Final Report and the Ford Foundation study, such as the upgrading of admissions and efforts to achieve increased centralization. Mission statements (series IV, subseries III) demonstrate how well the schools and divisions meet the recommendations of the Self Study in planning their futures. Of particular interest are a series of files on "Project Apex," a program designed to train high-school students to teach in poverty stricken areas. In addition, the first series contains a report on early experiments with LSD.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Niles was committed to building a strong central core around the arts and sciences at NYU, making undergraduate schools his priority. The files attest to his goals and movement toward centralization that the Office of Chancellor and Executive Vice President was largely responsible for promoting. Niles' administrative records show him to be in touch with all aspects of University operations and demonstrates the growth of the position since the first years of David Henry's term.</field>
