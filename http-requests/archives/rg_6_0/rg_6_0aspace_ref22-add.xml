    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The administrative records of David D. Henry and Carroll V. Newsom span the years 1948-1956, with the bulk of the material having been created between 1952-1956. The subgroup measures approximately 6.3 linear feet; 5 linear inches remain from Newsom's tenure. The scant number of records attributed to Newsom suggest that he took many of his files with him upon being elected President of the University in 1956, leaving records that were indistinct or closely linked to the files of David Henry, as in the case of the educational television series. The records of David Henry contain some gaps as well; not all files seem to cover his full term in office. The material has been split into 3 series: administrative; educational television; and speeches and biographical information (Henry only).</field>
