    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Janice Gorn Papers document Gorn's experiences as a professor at New York University (NYU).  The papers are almost entirely professional in nature and focus on her academic life. Much of the collection consists of Gorn's correspondence with Walter MacKeller, Adolphe E. Meyer, George Nelson and Geoffrey Bruun. Also included are her course syllabi from 1968 to 1981 as well as a draft of Gorn's book Style guide for the writing of scholarly papers, masters' theses and doctoral dissertations, published in 1971. 
The collection also contains sound recordings of lectures by others on such topics as in-vitro fertilization and Sigmund Freud, as well as photographs of NYU administrators, faculty, and leading public figures from the 20th century.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Janice Gorn was a professor of Interdisciplinary Studies and Education and an administrator at New York University (NYU) from the 1960s through the 1990s. Gorn received her Ph.D. from NYU in 1958 and worked as a professor at Paterson State College in New Jersey 1959 to 1961. In 1961 she was hired as an assistant professor of education. By 1969 she had been appointed to NYU's School of Education, Health, Nursing, and Arts Professions (SEHNAP) as a professor of Interdisciplinary Studies and the only professor appointed solely to the Interdisciplinary Studies program. In 1978, Gorn won a Great Teacher Award, and she continued to teach until the 1990s, on contemporary education issues.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gore remained active in the school's dissertation proposal seminar and served on all doctoral dissertation committees. Her writing focused on improving students' writing ability, and she frequently argued for a course on teaching and learning spoken English. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gorn was also active in NYU administration and served on a number of committees and as an ombudsman.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The collection was donated by Janice Gorn to the University Archives from 1984 to 1993.</field>
