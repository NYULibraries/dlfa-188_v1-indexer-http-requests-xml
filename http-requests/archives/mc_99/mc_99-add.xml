The Northern Dispensary records span from 1827 through the 1950s and include annual reports, minutes of the board, executive committee meetings, logs of applicants who applied to work as physicians and visiting committees, as well as photographs and illustrations.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Northern Dispensary of the City of New York was founded in 1827 and incorporated in 1928 by a group of private citizens to provide medical care at minimal or no cost to the needy and indigent in lower Manhattan.  In 1831 the Dispensary moved to a tringular-shaped building, located at the intersection of Waverly Place, Grove Street and Christopher Street, in Manhattan's Greenwich Village.  After World War II the Dispensary became a dental clinic and remained open until 1989, at which time it closed due to a funding shortage.  Subsequently, the building, which is an historical landmark, was transferred to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.</field>
