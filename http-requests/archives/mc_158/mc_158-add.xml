    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Washington Square Music Festival was founded in 1953 by violinist Alexander Schneider and the Washington Square Association. The Washington Square Music Festival is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, which operates specifically to provide free public concerts in Washington Square Park. It is sponsored by the Washington Square Association, a civic group formed in 1906, and is funded in part by the affiliated nonprofit Washington Square Association Music Fund. Since the 1970s, the Festival and its fundraising activities have been largely overseen by Executive Director Margaret "Peggy" Friedman and Chairperson Margaret T. "Peggy" Campbell. Friedman remains Executive Director today.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Past performances have included works by diverse composers, including Leonard Bernstein and Richard Wagner, as well as works for the band and chamber ensemble. Planned programming for 2012 will also include a West African concert. The Festival has hosted a number of conductors, ensembles, and soloists, including longtime oboist and conductor Henry Schuman.</field>
