    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This modest assemblage of material is contained in approximately 2.5 Hollinger boxes, for a total of 1.041 linear feet. The University budget sequence reflects the nature of the efforts made to contain spending and eliminate the deficit. In Box 25, folder 14 Sawhill advises officers and deans of an "unacceptable" deficit forecast, 10/15/75; in folder 15 he announces a "strict freeze on all hiring," 1/9/76 and Dean Dick Netzer defends the budgets of the "poor" schools, such as the Graduate School of Public Administration, 1/21/76.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Early in Sawhill's tenure, in a major restructuring, he appointed Allan E. Claxton Vice President for Finance, effectively removing from the Chancellor's purview those budgetary responsibilities and fiscal control mechanisms previously under his aegis, Box 39, folder 7, Sawhill to Trustees' Financial Affairs Committee 12/5/75, NYU Press Release 2/4/76. Claxton's involvement can be seen beginning with Box 26, folder 1, 4/2/76, folder 2, 6/30/76. For continuing progress in containing the deficit, see folder 4, Sawhill 1/31/77, folder 5, Sawhill 3/9/78. For some history of the deficit and further detail, see Box 27, folder 1, Borowitz to Trustees, spring '75, Borowitz Papers (RG 6.0.7), Boxes 29 and 30, and Senate Financial Affairs Committee (RG 14).</field>
