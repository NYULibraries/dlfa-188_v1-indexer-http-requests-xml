    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series offers a comprehensive picture of John Crittenden Sawhill's fundraising efforts for NYU. It occupies 8 Hollinger boxes, measuring 3.333 linear feet. Correspondence forms the bulk of the series, from which a variety of information can be gleaned. Corporate leaders with little or no prior NYU connection were approached, see Mark Kaplan to Sawhill, 3/7/77, Box 18, folder 6. Sawhill's multiple hat persona appears, see Rawleigh Warner Jr. to Sawhill 1/14/77 and Sawhill to Warner 1/19/77, Box 20, folder 15, as do his views on corporate philanthropy, Sawhill to John S. Burr 4/5/77 in response to Burr to Sawhill 3/23/77, Box 21, folder 11, and a comprehensive snub, General Motors, Box 18, folder 17.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some commentary on the Mueller Spaghetti Company sale appears, see Sawhill to Harold K. Hochschild 10/12/76, Box 19, folder 3 and to Alvin C. Zises, 10/15/76, Box 23, folder 3. A picture of extensive exchanges with the Shah of Iran and his representatives in Tehran and the United States emerges, Box 19, folder 5. The impact of the Leadership Campaign on NYU is described 5/9/80 by Ivan Loveridge Bennett Jr. to John E. Marshall III of the Kresge Foundation, Box 19, folder 16. A 7/26/54 analysis of institutional science facilities needs is found in Ray Harvey to David D. Henry, in Olin Foundation, Box 21, folder 8. A "Local Review Statement," on University goals was submitted to the National Science Foundation, 3/15/76, Box 21, folder 2.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some connections have substantial history, such as the Gottesman Foundation, from 11/65, Box 18, folder 19, International Business Machines, 10/68, Box 19, folder 6, Mrs. Mary Lasker, 1/55, Box 20, folder 3. Two serendipidously consecutive folders offer a marked contrast between a devoted Washington Square alumnus, Michael Schimmel, and a disaffected University Heights alumnus, Henry R. Schnitzer Foundation, Box 22, folders 1-2. Finally, in Box 23, folder 12, Sawhill speaks to Gallatin Associates as NYU "booster," 12/2/75 and 10/7/76, and in folder 18 the University is profiled in the development 4/77 draft, "Our Presence in New York." </field>
