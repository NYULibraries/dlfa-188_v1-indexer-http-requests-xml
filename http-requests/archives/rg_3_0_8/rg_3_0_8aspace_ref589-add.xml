    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This single Hollinger box, 1.25 linear feet, contains the limited amount of materials retained by the Sawhill office relating to the University's transactions with federal, state and local entities. Much of it is routine. Matters of interest may be found mainly among the Arnold Goren memoranda, Box 35, folder 15, Box 36, folder 2, Box 37, folders 6-13. Goren had represented the University in New York City and Albany on political matters dealing with higher education and specifically NYU prior to Sawhill's arrival at NYU; Sawhill continued this appointment, moving him into that role in the federal arena as well soon after the President's arrival, Box 35, folder 12, Goren to Sawhill 12/30/75.</field>

Sawhill concerning the federal "marriage tax," also referenced in Series IX, and which was widely distributed. Folder 17 offers Carol Bellamy on (NY) City and State Budgets 3/24/79, see particularly p. 5, while Box 36, folder 11 contains a full copy of the 9/1/75 Report of the Regents Advisory Commission on the Financial Problems of Postsecondary Institutions.
