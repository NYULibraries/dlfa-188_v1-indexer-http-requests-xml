    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is contained in 7 Hollinger boxes. Academic matters, the lead topic, is found in Boxes 1-part of 5, with Box 1 and part of Box 2 incorporating descriptive material about awards recognizing scholarship. Some brief coverage regarding honorary degrees is located in Box 28, folder 13. The balance of this section is material addressing efforts to augment the University's limited number of endowed chairs. For additional material on the Albert Schweitzer Chair in the Humanities, see RG 21.1; for more on the proposed Oscar Morgenstern Chair see Box 19, folder 3 for Harold Hochschild/Sawhill correspondence, and the Morgenstern biographical file in the Archives' general collections.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The remainder of Box 2 and Box 3 provides an overview of Sawhill's overtures to and agreements with other local institutions for academic consortia offerings and possible institutional partnerships, some of the latter perhaps conceived to enable NYU to tap new populations of students in New York City's suburbs. These overtures did not always sit well with the leaders of other institutions (see Pace University President Edward Mortola to Sawhill 12/28/76, Box 2, folder 8). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">NYU's continuing interest in justifying offering engineering courses can be glimpsed (see Box 3, folder 7, Berlowitz/Hamburger to Sawhill, 8/7/78 and Box 6, folder 6, deCapriles to Borowitz 7/22/75). For a more comprehensive exposure to this topic see the Records of the Office of the Chancellor/Executive Vice President (Sidney Borowitz), RG 6.0.7, Series V, Subseries II. Box 4, among a miscellany of mostly intramural program development topics, contains in folder 3 some indication of the content of NYU and then-new-neighbor Hebrew Union College's Statement of Understanding, signed 7/21/77. The remainder of this series deals with general academic and administrative activity. Some insights into Sawhill's management views can be found in Box 7, folder 6, Sawhill to Bromberg, Payne, von Raab 7/22/75 and Box 7, folder 7, Vernon Miller to Oliva 11/28/78. </field>
