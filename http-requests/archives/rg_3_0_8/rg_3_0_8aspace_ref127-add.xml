    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II is comprised of 8 boxes totaling 3.33 linear feet. Its content stems from John Crittenden Sawhill's extramural worklife while at NYU, both NYU and non-NYU-related, and more than substantiates his "workaholic" persona; for this self-definition, see Sawhill to Maurice Greenberg 7/11/78, Box 14, folder 7. The broad variety of activity represented in this series has been divided into four subseries, defined as follows: subseries I, NYU-Related, New York City, etc.; subseries II, not-for-profit, energy, etc.; subseries III, directorships; subseries IV, higher education, corporate, personal, etc. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries I, Box 8 contains rather a mix of information. Some Committee for Astor Place items are found in folder 17; additional material titled Astor Place Improvement is located in Box 40, folders 10-12. Box 9, folders 1-3 offers an immediate impression of Sawhill's range of initiatives during his presidency; in folder I, approaches to the corporate community; folder 2, a talk on the case for the liberal arts; folder 3, his role on New York City's Emergency Financial Control Board. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries II offers substance to the picture of Sawhill's on-going involvement in national energy policy review and advocacy, see the Aspen Institute sequence, Box 10, folders 16-19, Box 11, folders 1-5, and Box 12, folder 5, Shimoda (Japan) Conference, Box 12, folders 15-17, and Mitre Corporation, Box 13, folders 1-5. Box 12 contains evidence of a more general reach in the public policy arena as well. His application for Common Cause membership appears in folder 1, his membership on the Federal Power Commission Advisory Committee, folder 6. Box 13 offers more in this vein, i.e., he consults for the National Science Board, National Science Foundation, folder 6, serves as a public member of New York State's Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), folder 9, and as a member of the Energy Advisory Committee of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, folder 10, and sometimes sets priorities as when he resigns from the Natural Resources Defense Council to accept appointment to New York's Emergency Financial Control Board, folder 7, while Box 14, folder 1 identifies his consultancy to the Administrator of the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration. Frequently he wore his several hats at once, as exemplified in Box 11, folder 13, where, as a Committee for Economic Development (CED) member and a University president, he participates in a CED survey of academic leaders on federal support of research and development, Robert Holland to Thomas Vanderslice 12/28/78, and in Box 14, folder 10, when as Crane Company corporate director and University president he comments on NYU investment strategy 5/23/78.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries III, found in part of Box 14 and part of Box 15, documents directorship appointment, among them several in the natural resource sector, United Siscoe Mines Ltd., Box 15, folder 6, Geothermal Kinetics, inc., Box 14, folder 12, North American Coal Corporation, Box 15, folder 2, and Consolidated Edison (NY), Box 14, folder 9. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries IV has been constructed somewhat arbitrarily, to incorporate a miscellany of documents. Among the higher education-related materials in Box 15, see Sawhill to Gail Parker 12/8/75, folder 8. For an NYU response to a CHANGE Magazine survey identifying those institutions NYU saw as peers, to consult with or use as models, 4/15/76, folder 9. Another kind of NYU profile is located in folder 12, a survey of cost-related data and analysis in institutions of higher education. Also among the miscellany were references to the Washington Square Music Festival and the Friends of Washington Square Park, which were transferred to Archives H.</field>
