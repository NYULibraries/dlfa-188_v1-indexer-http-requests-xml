He received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia in 1980 and a Master of Arts degree in cinema studies from New York University in 1983. He published widely in academic journals for cinema studies, and served as an adjunct professor teaching cinema history and theory at New York University, Iona College, Saint Francis College, and Concordia University. He was the director of the first and second annual Spoleto Film Festival in Charleston, South Carolina from 1977-1978. In his time spent in New York he created two film showing societies; the Thousand Eyes Cinema which is since merged with the Bleecker Street Theater from 1973-1974, and the Cineclub from 1972-1977.  In 1987, he developed The Reach Film Festival in Key West Florida. At the time of his death, he was completing his doctoral dissertation at New York University at the Tisch School of Arts.</field>
