    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of one scrapbook, comprised of approximately 78 leaves. The contents of the scrapbook are primarily obituaries of Morris Loeb, printed in New York City area newspapers shortly after his death in 1912.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Morris Loeb was born in 1863 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to banker Solomon Loeb and his wife Betty. Loeb was educated at Harvard University (1879-1883) and earned his Ph.D. in Berlin in 1887. In 1888 Loeb assisted his former Harvard professor Dr. Wolcott Gibbs, and the following year became a Docent in Chemistry at Clark University. In 1891, at the age of 28, he was appointed Chair of Chemistry at the University of the City of New York (renamed New York University in 1896), where he developed the Chemistry Department and was involved in the construction of the Havemeyer Chemical Laboratory on the University Heights campus. In 1906 Loeb left NYU to continue his research at a private laboratory at the Chemists' Club and eventually became that organization's president. Morris Loeb's scientific accomplishments included calculating the ionic velocity of silver, developing new methods for calculating molecular weights, and designing an improved cathode for measuring electric currents. Loeb was also a philanthropist, contributing to institutions such as the Hebrew Technical Institute for Boys, the Jewish Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society, the Chemists' Club, and Harvard University. Morris Loeb died on October 8, 1912, after suffering from typhoid, leaving behind his wife, Edna Kuhn Loeb, and no children.</field>
