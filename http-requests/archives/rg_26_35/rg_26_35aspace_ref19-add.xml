    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Department of Art and Art Professions is part of the New York University School of Education, which is currently called the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. At the beginning of the period represented by this series, the School of Education's Art courses were taught within Art Education, a program that focused on the training of teachers, supervisors, and directors of art education in elementary and secondary schools. By the 1990s, the renamed Department of Art and Art Professions had expanded to offer majors in Studio Art, Arts Education, Art Therapy, and Arts Administration, offering a PhD in Arts and Humanities or Art Education. In the 1940s, PhD candidates in the department of Art Education spent at least one year working on what was then referred to as a thesis. By the 1990s, students in Art and Arts Professions produced dissertations as part of their PhD requirements.</field>
