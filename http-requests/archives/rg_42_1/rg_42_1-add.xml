    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of records of the curators and University officers related to the administration of the James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches, as well as the lecture series "Time and Its Mysteries." This collection also contains photographs documenting James Arthur's clock and watch collection. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the materials in this collection date from 1931 to 1963, the year the clocks and watches were sent on permanent loan to the Smithsonian Institution.  The records are incomplete with many gaps. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection will be of value for answering queries about the history and disposition of the James Arthur Collection although it does not contain much information on the specific clocks and watches themselves.  The records also document the University's venture into maintaining a museum and its eventual decision to discontinue this effort. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dr. Arthur Lionel Rawlings is listed as the first curator of the Museum, a position he held from 1956 until his death in 1959. (The Arthur Collection had had specific curators before 1956.)  Before his appointment as curator, Rawlings served as the head of special products at the Bulova Research and Development Labs in Woodside, Queens. A native of England, Rawlings attended university in Birmingham and London and held many patents on gyro-compasses, gyroscopic stabilization, and fire-control devices. He wrote several books, including the then-standard works The Theory of the Gyro Compass and Science of Clocks and Watches.  Previous employers included Sperry Gyroscope, Ltd., the Scientific Research Branch of the British Admiralty, and the U.S. Time Corporation.  He also served as president of the Horological Society of New York and was a member of the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dr. Rawlings also gave one of the Arthur-funded lectures on May 15, 1953, on the following topic: "From Hours to Microseconds: Three Centuries of Timekeeping Progress, 1650-1950."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">An obituary for Dr. Rawlings from the Long Island Star-Journal from November 18, 1959, indicates that he passed away after suffering a heart attack while driving on the Van Wyck Expressway on November 17. He was 78. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Per an October 31, 1956, NYU press release, the Watch and Clock Museum was established in that year from the materials in three collections of timepieces then owned by the University. Over half the materials came from the James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches, which had been administered by the University since the 1930s. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Museum was housed in the Gould Memorial Library at NYU's University Heights campus. With over 3,000 timepieces, the Museum was touted as the largest horological collection in the Western Hempisphere at the time of its establishment.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Arthur Collection included books and research materials, as well as an endowment for the upkeep of the collection and a periodic lecture series on the topic of "time and its mysteries." The money did not prove sufficient for the upkeep and administration of such a varied and difficult collection (some of the timepieces dated from the 16th century).  Without the proper resources to reassemble the timepieces and without a sufficient display method, when the University Heights campus closed in 1964 and NYU relocated to Greenwich Village the artifacts were placed on permanent loan to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The books from the Arthur Collection were transferred to the University's rare books collection, and the records and photographs of the collection remained with the University Archives. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1982 New York University decided to dispose of the Arthur Collection, dividing the items between The Smithsonian Institution, the Time Museum at Rockford, and the NAWCC Museum at Columbia, Pennsylvania but has retained the records of the collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1985 the Smithsonian transferred the timepieces to the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, Pennsylvania. In 2006, six of the timepiecse from the collection were sold at auction. More information may be found at the museum's website: http://www.nawcc.org/collections.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">James Arthur was born February 26, 1842, in Crosscandley, Ireland. As a boy he studied mechanics and developed an interest in horology. In 1871 he emigrated to New York where in 1885 he founded Arthur and Co., manufacturers of mechanical models for inventors and devices such as differential gears for automobiles.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Arthur's spare time was spent collecting and designing and making clocks and watches.  In 1925, at the suggestion of his son-in-law, Irving H. Berg, Chaplain of New York University (1919-1936), and later Dean of University College (1936-1941), Arthur presented his collection of 300 clocks, more than 1500 watches and books to New York University. Accompanying the gift was an endowment of $110,000 to support a series of lectures on "time and its mysteries", to keep the collection in a state of repair and to provide for new acquisitions.  Arthur stipulated that none of the income was to be used to pay curators. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">James Arthur died in Winsted, Connecticut on April 27, 1930.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The records include information on the clock and watch collection and on the lecture series, "Time and Its Mysteries".  The arrangement of the materials found in Archives H and in the office of the Dean of Libraries was chronological; papers from these two sources have been interfiled. </field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Materials found in Series V: Photographs were transferred from the New York University Archives Photograph Collection (PHOTO.00001) in May 2024. The accession number associated with this accretion is 2024.030.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">The records of the James Arthur Collection of Clocks and Watches were housed with the "Archives H" collection of the University Archives; no accession data is available.  Several folders of related material (3 inches) were transferred from the office of the Dean of Libraries in December 1984, and incorporated with the records from Archives H. Fifteen feet of material on the Arthur Collection is on deposit at the Smithsonian Institution.  The Arthur book collection remains at the University and is housed in the Special Collections Department of Bobst Library. Although the records cover an extensive time period, 1926-1982, they are not complete. </field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Materials separated from the collection include photographs (see separation sheet) and 28 items (newspaper clippings and Thermofax copies) which were photocopied on acid-free paper.  Additional conservation measures taken were the removal of staples and paper clips and replacement with plastic clips when necessary.</field>
