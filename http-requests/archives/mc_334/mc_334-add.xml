    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This is an artificial collection of printed material and publications from over 500 different schools, divisions, and organizations within New York University dating from 1835 to 2022. The publications typically include newsletters, event calendars, bulletins, websites, and magazines. The promotional material and ephemera contains brochures, booklets, mailers, and pamphlets, as well as posters. Material in the collection was separated from their original NYU University Archives record groups and placed together for easier access. This is not necessarily a complete set of any of these publications and it is possible that the same titles and print material are also found within their original record groups. 
 

Some materials in this collection contain racist, abilist, and sexist imagery and text. Both RG 21.32 and RG 39.30's titles were retained due to their historical context. Both RG 39.30's group name and publication title were created by an NYU Black student group.</field>

    <field name="custodhist_teim">Websites were selected by NYU University Archives staff through the use of Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. Websites were not accessioned prior to October 2018. Websites added to the web archives after October 2018 are associated with the following accession numbers: 2019.106, 2019.107, 2019.122, 2020.012, 2020.013, 2020.041, 2021.003, 2021.036, 2021.037, 2021.038, 2021.039, 2021.040, 2022.029, 2022.033, 2022.070, 2022.072, 2022.078, 2022.079, 2023.014, 2023.023, 2023.030, 2023.057, 2024.007, 2024.018.</field>

For the archived websites, robots.txt (a piece of code designed to limit crawler activity within a website) was ignored with the permission of the content owner.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content.
