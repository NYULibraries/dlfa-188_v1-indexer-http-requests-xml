    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Records of the Student Senators Council consists of materials created and collected by the Student Senators Council (SSC) and University Council of Student Life (UCSL) from 1974 to 2018. Series I, III-V, VI, and X contain administrative papers, budgets, bylaws, constitutions, presentation notes, rules of procedures, resolutions, correspondence, memorandums, agendas, minutes, and reports, all of which provide in-depth insight regarding the ways in which the SSC and UCSL upheld the Council's mission to represent, protect, and promote the rights and interests of New York University students. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In order to become a member of the Student Senators Council, students from NYU's various schools were required to apply for a position within the SSC by submitting applications, resumes, personal statements, and in some cases, references. Series VIII: Membership contains materials relating to the recruitment of members such as completed applications, election materials, and advertisements; lists of selected Senators-at-Large and their alternates; committee preference sheets; and guidelines for selecting members. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The SSC oversaw numerous committees and boards, all of which are documented in Series II: Committees &amp; Boards. This series mainly contains correspondence, administrative papers, some budgets, minutes, some audiocassette tapes, and memorandums -- all of which provide explanations about the work and goals of these groups, their roles within the New York University community, as well as their missions and values.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to representing, protecting, and promoting the rights and interests of NYU students, the SSC prioritized the needs and wants of the student body by organizing social events throughout the academic year and providing various types of information guides. Series VI: Events provides details about social gatherings like books fairs, annual dinners and banquets for the student senators, the Violet Ball, and the All University Games through promotional materials, correspondence, photographs, administrative files, and invitations. Series IX: Student Resources contains directories, student handbooks, pamphlets with overviews about student government and SSC, guides to University services, as well as general information abyout NYU in the form of maps and recommendation lists. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York University Student Senators Council (SSC) is part of the University Senate alongside the Administrators Management Council, Deans Council, Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators Council (C-FSC), and the Tenured/Tenure Track Faculty Senators Council (T-FSC); the latter two groups replaced the Faculty Senators Council, which was also originally affiliated with the SSC and University Senate. The SSC's 35 members consist of 23 student senators elected from the different schools at NYU and 12 student senators-at-large who are selected by other student senators. To ensure students always have a representative present at meetings, student senators are assigned an alternate in case of an absence. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The student senators are governed by the Senate Rules of Procedure, which are amended as needed. These rules outline members' responsibilities, meeting information, and committee information. According to the rules, the SSC's main function is to "be the representative body for all students at New York University, shall represent the students of New York University on the University Senate (Senate), and shall protect and promote the interests, rights, and responsibilities of students in all aspects of student life at the University."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The SSC is divided into numerous committees and each senator is required to participate in at least one. Non-SSC students are also invited to participate in the committees. The SSC's most significant committee, the University Committee on Student Life (UCSL), oversees student life on campus and is broken into smaller subcommittees such as the All Square Student Budget Allocation Committee (ASSABC), the Student Affairs Budget Advisory Committee (SABAC), and the Student Activities Board (SAB). </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to the governing aspects of the University, the SSC is also involved in event planning, sponsoring events such as the Violet Ball and the All-University Games each year. </field>
