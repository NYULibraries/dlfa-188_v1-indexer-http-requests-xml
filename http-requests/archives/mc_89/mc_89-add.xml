    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Women in Communications, Inc. (WICI) Records consist of materials created and collected by WICI and NYWICI from 1918-1985. Materials cover the organization's inception as the New York chapter of Theta Sigma Phi and its evolution to the Women in Communications, Inc. (WICI) in 1972. Materials in this collection encompass the national organization and the New York chapter prior to the formation of NYWICI as a discrete organization. A majority of the collection, however, focuses on the New York chapter of WICI. Materials include administrative matters (general correspondence and financial documents), events and programs (printed matter and correspondence for luncheons, workshops, and conferences), governing bodies (correspondence and memos, meeting agendas and minutes, and elections of members of the board of directors, executive committee, and other committees), the Matrix Awards (photographs, invitations and programs, correspondence, committee materials, and nominations), membership files (mailings and correspondence), and publications such as newsletters and membership directories. Other chapters, such as Boston and Philadelphia, are represented sparsely. All of the materials reflect the organization's mission of supporting women at different career stages and providing professional development opportunities.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1929, Theta Sigma Phi, the first female branch of the journalism fraternity, was founded in order to obtain equal pay to the males in the profession. In 1972, the organization was renamed Women in Communications, Inc. (WICI); WICI then became the Association for Women in Communications (AWC) in 1996. In 1998, the New York chapter, which had been very active, separated from the national organization and became New York Women in Communications, Inc. (NYWICI). New York Women in Communications is a professional organization for female communications professionals with a mission of supporting women at every career stage, fighting for equal pay, and encouraging women to speak up. WICI had a similar mission, to "keep its members prepared to meet the challenges of the rapidly developing communications profession," as noted in a brochure from 1976. WICI had members in a variety of communications disciplines (which NYWICI continues to have) including journalism, broadcasting, publishing, advertising, integrated marketing, photography, public relations, graphic design, and more. Since 1971, first WICI and now NYWICI, has honored leaders in the industry with the Matrix Award, and each year, the organization awards scholarships and grants to high school seniors, college and graduate students, and women looking for career changes. </field>
