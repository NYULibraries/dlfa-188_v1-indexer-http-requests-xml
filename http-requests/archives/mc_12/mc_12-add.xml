    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Ronald L. Brown Collection on Early Instruction at the New York University School of Law consists of photocopies of published material and typescript copies of manuscript correspondence documenting the history of instruction at the New York University School of Law in the early to mid 19th century.  These materials were compiled by Ronald L. Brown of NYU's Law Library and staff of the University Archives for Brown's book, The Law School Papers of Benjamin F. Butler: New York University School of Law in the 1830s.  There is very little original material in this collection, the bulk being photocopies.  Material includes correspondence between Brown, Bayrd Still, and other University Archives staff in the early 1980s; summaries and typescripts of correspondence between Butler, Harriet Butler, J. M. Mathews, Martin Van Buren, H. D. Gilpin, and David Graham, Jr.; and clippings and published articles about Butler and the law school.</field>
