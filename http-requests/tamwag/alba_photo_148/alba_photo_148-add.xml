    <field name="abstract_teim">During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) Colonias Infantiles (children's colonies) were established in rural locales by the government of the Spanish Republic after fascist forces bombed Spanish cities, and many thousands of children were orphaned, driven from their homes or made destitute by war. Children's colonies were established in Spain, and individuals and groups of child refugees were also sent abroad for safety. Spanish children's colonies were founded in France and the United Kingdom at this time. The collection contains photographs of children eating, bathing, studying, doing chores, resting, and playing.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: The Children's Colonies Photograph Collectionconsists of photographs related to the children's colonies in Spain and France. A number of the prints are stamped to indicate that they were taken for the Propaganda Section of the Republic's Children's Aid organization (Ajut Infantil de Reraguarda). The collection contains photographs of children eating, bathing, studying, doing chores, resting, and playing. Some images show teachers or other adult staff of the colonies. A number of files include exterior views of colony buildings, and interior shots of dormitories and dining halls. Of the total, 347 black and white prints are in files arranged alphabetically by either the name or the location of the colony. In addition to the images of children in identified colonies, there are ten images of children with donated toys and nine images of children in undesignated locations.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), roughly 200,000 of the 600,000 refugees seeking shelter from the armies of Generalissimo Franco and his fascist allies were children. Many children were orphaned or lost their homes. The bombing of large cities placed children at greatest risk, and many were moved to safer locations in the rural periphery. The government of the Spanish Republic established colonias infantiles (children's colonies), often in rural estates which had been abandoned by fascist sympathizers. Some parents and guardians sent children, individually or in groups, abroad for safety. Children's colonies were established in Spain, as well as in France and the United Kingdom, affording young refugees the opportunity to receive an education, medical care, and the company of other Spanish children. Photographs of children in these homes or colonies were taken for use in periodicals or publicity material, either produced by the Republic or produced and distributed by aid organizations in various countries.</field>
