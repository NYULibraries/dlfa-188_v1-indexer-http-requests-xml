    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists primarily of photocopied material from the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. Department of Justice, U. S. Bureau of Prisons and other government agencies. The copies were provided to Rosalyn F. Baxandall and Helen C. Camp as a result of separate requests under the Freedom of Information Act in the mid-1980s. Because there was considerable duplication of material between the Baxandall and Camp files, duplicate files have been eliminated and the files have been arranged in one series, beginning with FBI files arranged by file number and concluding with files arranged by agency of origin.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Individual files may contain a wide variety of documents, including intercepted correspondence of Flynn and her associates, correspondence between government officials and agents, clippings, leaflets and other radical political materials, reports or summaries of reports by agents and informants, and summarizes the contents of the Daily Worker and other publications. There may be considerable duplication of content between files, as government agencies and branches regularly transmitted material from their files to each other.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series begins with a folder of Baxandall requests and related correspondence; these letters were found without accompanying documents. Where request letters were found in the collection with accompanying documents, they have been filed along with those documents. The series ends with a bound volume of material secured by Baxandall through a legal proceeding (Baxandall vs. FBI, DOJ, CIA [CA - 82 - 8736]). NOTE: boxes 1-4 have been processed and microfilmed; boxes 5-6 are unprocessed and not microfilmed.</field>
