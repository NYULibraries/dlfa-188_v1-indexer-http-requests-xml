    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Graduate Student Organizing Committee (GSOC-UAW Local 2110) is the union for graduate employees at New York University (NYU) and the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. This includes teaching assistants, research assistants, and graduate assistants. The Polytechnic Institute organizes science and engineering graduate students. The union was established in 1998 and negotiated their first contract with NYU in 2002. In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board reversed the Brown University decision, declaring private universities are not required to bargain with graduate employees and leading to NYU not negotiating a new contract. Capture of the website began in 2009, which contained information on the history of GSOC, their contract, press converage, press releases, member information, and action campaigns. Capture of  http://www.makingabetternyu.org/ began in 2013, containing information about the union and its Polytechnic Institute (later Tandon) affiliate (SET-UAW), campaigns, news, healthcare petition, and event listings. Over time, the website has been updated to include their current contract, bargaining information, solidarity statements and resolutions, caucuses, and documentation on the union's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and demands to NYU administration to support graduate student workers. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also includes the websites for the New York University Academic Workers for a Democratic Union the social justice caucus of GSOC. https://collectiveactiongetsthegoods.tumblr.com/ contained their principles, 2014 bargaining report, statements of solidarity with other striking graduate students unions, bargaining updates, information on elections and strikes in 2014-2015, and news from the union. https://nyuawdu.wordpress.com/ was captured starting in 2020, when GSOC began bargaining for a new contract. The website contains their bargaining platform, bargaining committee members, updates, and fliers.</field>
