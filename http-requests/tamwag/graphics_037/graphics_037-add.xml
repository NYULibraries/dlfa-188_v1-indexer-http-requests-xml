    <field name="abstract_teim">The Fred Wright Cartoons consist of roughly 50 original cartoons by Fred Wright. Wright was a staff artist for the UE News, the paper of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (UE). He also produced artwork for the union's fliers and organizational material. Generally, each drawing is ink on paper or board and stamped on the back by the UE News and thus was likely either published in that publication or submitted for publication. The cartoons cover a number of different issues including civil rights in the south and civil liberties, as well labor issues, military spending, and the Vietnam War. The material ranges in date from 1950-1969.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Fred Wright Cartoons consist of roughly 50 signed and original cartoons dated from 1950-1969. Wright was a staff artist for the UE News, the newspaper of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). It is presumed that the drawings were produced for that publication as a majority of the cartoons are stamped from the UE News on the back. The cartoons cover topics pertinent to the UE, including several on workplace safety issues. Central figures in Wright's cartoons include a military officer, often used to criticize military over social spending, and a large capitalist used to represent profit. There are cartoons regarding the FBI, and depictions of John Foster Dulles. Other topics found in the collection include: civil liberation and civil rights, elections, inflation, and the Vietnam War. Additionally, there are two folders of unsigned prints in the collection. These are in a similar style as Wright's and so likely were drawn by him as well.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Fred Wright (1907â€“1984) was a renowned American labor cartoonist and activist. He was best known for his work as staff cartoonist for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE). In addition to his cartoons illustrating the union's newspaper, the UE News, Wright designed leaflets, strike placards, and organizing cartoons.  He sold his first cartoon to the National Maritime Union's paper, The Pilot, in 1939 and was hired by the UE in 1949. In the spirit of the labor movement, Wright's cartoons criticize the Taft-Hartley Act, McCarthyism, and other government post-war attacks on labor unions.</field>
