    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists mostly of published and unpublished writings, many of them written for the Daily Worker, for the monthly journal, Communist, or for the international Communist movement weekly, International Press Correspondence. Also included are reports to various Communist Party national and local bodies, including reports to District Six (headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio), for which he served as the District Organizer and a report detailing the Communist movement's activities in the city of Rockford, Ohio, as well as radio speeches, some relating to Amis' labor and Communist Party activism in Eastern Pennsylvania. There are also several collective bargaining agreements signed by Amis on behalf of the Local Joint Board of Philadelphia, consisting of Local 758 and several other locals of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees' International Alliance and Bartenders' International Union (AFL). The majority of Amis' writings relate to the struggle for Africa-American civil rights, and the Communist Party's positions on civil rights issues. There is also a file relating to the Philadelphia Committee for the Defense of Ethiopia, a file relating to his candidacy for the office of Auditor General of Pennsylvania, clippings, letters to Amis from Philadelphia government officials in response to his queries about community issues, a 1947 letter from Ben Davis, copies of photographs, and a copy of a 2004 biographical article by his son, Barry D. Amis, published in the Communist Party's newspaper, the People's Weekly World.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">B. D. (B. DeWayne) Amis, 1896-1993, was an African-American Communist Party USA and labor union organizer. Amis was born in Chicago and by 1928 was president of the NAACP branch in Peoria, IL, when the Communist Party invited him to come to New York. Amis became a member of the National Committee of the Communist-inspired American Negro Labor Congress, and also wrote articles for the Daily Worker, the party newspaper. In 1930, Amis became general secretary of the Communist-inspired League of Struggle for Negro Rights (LSNR) and an editor of its publication, The Liberator. During this period Amis wrote the pamphlets Lynch Justice at Work (1930) and They shall not die!: The story of Scottsboro in pictures (1932). Amis went on to become the District Organizer for the Communist Party in Cleveland and traveled to the Soviet Union on two occasions, the second time for about a year and a half. While there, he took courses in Marxism and wrote articles for the Negro Worker, the newspaper of the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Upon his return to the United States, Amis settled in Philadelphia where he joined the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) as a field organizer. He was also the head of the Philadelphia committee of the National Negro Congress, and the chairman of the Philadelphia Committee for the Defense of Ethiopia. He ran as the Communist candidate for Auditor General of Pennsylvania in 1936. He went on to organize Catering Industry Employees Union, Local 758, an African-American local of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union (AFL), serving as Secretary-Treasurer of both organizations, ca. 1939-1942. He subsequently worked for the Gulf Oil Company, while continuing his union and community organizing activities. Amis died in 1993.</field>
