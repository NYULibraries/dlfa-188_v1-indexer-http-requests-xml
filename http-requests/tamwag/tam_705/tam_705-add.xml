    <field name="abstract_teim">The Stephen Salant Research Files on Alger Hiss documents Stephen Salant's research on the Alger Hiss espionage case. Stephen W. Salant is an American economist who has done extensive research on the trials of Alger Hiss, focusing primarily on a set of microfilm reels known as the "Pumpkin Papers." Materials in this collection include documentation of Salant's research process into the microfilm and his 1975 lawsuit against the US Justice Department to provide access to these documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). These materials include FOIA request documents, copies of documents related to the Hiss trials, and correspondence between Salant's attorneys and the Department of Justice. The collection also contains notes, supporting research, and drafts of Salant's writing about the Hiss trials. Research materials include correspondence with other researchers, correspondence with the Kodak film company regarding the dating of the microfilm, a summary of an interview Salant conducted with a House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigator, and correspondence with an economic advisor to the State Department.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Stephen Salant Research Files on Alger Hiss documents Stephen Salant's research on the Alger Hiss case. Salant's research focused on reexamining evidence used against Hiss during his perjury trials, and relied largely on records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Materials in this collection include documentation of from Salant's 1975 FOIA lawsuit against the US Department of Justice to provide access to a set of microfilm reels known as the "Pumpkin Papers." Materials related to the lawsuit include FOIA request documents, copies of government documents related to the Hiss case, and correspondence between Salant's attorneys and the Department of Justice. The collection also contains Salant's notes about the Hiss case and supporting research, which include a copy of an essay Salant wrote about the case as a student at Columbia in 1963. Research materials include correspondence with the Kodak film company regarding the dating of the microfilm, and with other researchers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">One box of materials added to the collection in 2017 contains additional legal briefs and proceedings from Salant's 1978 FOIA lawsuit. These materials include additional research documents related to the "Pumpkin Papers" gathered by Salant, including a summary of an interview Salant conducted with House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigator Donald Apel, and the correspondence of Emile Despres, economic adviser to the State Department, dated 1947. Materials from this donation also include a small set of research on the National Counter Intelligence Corps Association (NCICA), including copies of its newsletter the Golden Sphinx, dated 2005-2013.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Stephen Salant is an economist who taught at the University of Michigan from 1986 to 2015. He is most well-known for his research in the area of applied microeconomics focusing on industrial organization and environmental economics. Salant has also maintained a continued interest in the Alger Hiss case and has performed independent research into evidence from the case, particularly the "Pumpkin Papers" microfilm. He suggested the possibility that the "Pumpkin Papers" microfilm might have been produced in the 1940s, rather than the 1930s as Whittaker Chambers claimed, and recommended confirming this hypothesis with a chemical test. Salant also identified the Chief Investigator hired by Hiss' attorneys as a spycatcher, an undercover Special Agent in the Army's Counter Intelligence Corps. In 1978 Salant sued the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in an attempt to gain access to government records related to the trials. He also co-edited The Rand Journal of Economics at the Rand Corporation.</field>
