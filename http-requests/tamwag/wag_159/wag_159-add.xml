    <field name="abstract_teim">The Jewish Labor Committee (JLC) was founded in 1934 by Jewish labor union leaders along with Jewish cultural associations to act in response to the rise of the Nazi Party in Europe.  Before and during World War II, the JLC raised funds and organized people to fight the spread of the Nazi Party.  Since the 1950s the JLC has worked to facilitate cooperation and communication between the Jewish community and labor, focusing on fighting prejudice and discrimination in the workforce.  The Jewish Labor Committee Northeast Region Records document the work of the JLC office based in Boston, Massachusetts.  The collection consists of subject files compiled by Herman Brown, the regional director of the JLC's Northeast Region, and dates between 1963 and 2002, with the bulk of the material dating between 1986 and 1998.  These files contain correspondence, clippings, reports, and publications regarding the work of the JLC in New England.</field>
