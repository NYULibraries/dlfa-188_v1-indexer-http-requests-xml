    <field name="abstract_teim">Founded in 1973, the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB) creates and supports community-controlled affordable housing in New York City. UHAB supports New Yorkers to acquire, rehabilitate, and manage their apartments. Their programs include providing loans to first-time home buyers; developing new affordable co-ops; and organizing tenants facing landlord harassment and neglect. UHAB has undertaken a long-running oral history program with residents of HDFC co-ops, a type of resident-controlled, cooperatively-owned, and permanently affordable housing unique to New York City. The Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB) Oral History Collection (dated 2018-2022) consists of electronic audio recordings, transcripts, and photographs created in the course of the UHAB oral history program with residents of HDFC co-ops. The oral history interviews and supplemental materials document an under-represented but influential housing rights movement, spanning four boroughs and thousands of homes from the 1970s to the present day. The oral history project seeks to preserve the voices and memories of HDFC residents so that they may be passed down to future generations of building residents, as well as educate the public on the value of this affordable housing model. The interviews cover topics such as governance, time management, and equity; the internal politics of running a co-op; rehabilitation and renovation of buildings; squats and squatters; family life in co-ops; challenges of working with city officials; the long-term effects of secure, stable housing; navigating generational and demographic changes; community and building maintenance; and the struggle to remain affordable in a financialized housing market. Co-ops like Umbrella House are featured; participants are also spread out across New York in neighborhoods like Harlem, Washington Heights, South Bronx, Lower East Side, and Brownsville. Interviews address race, immigration, and gentrification.</field>
