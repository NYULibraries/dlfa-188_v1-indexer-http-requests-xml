    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Jesusa Rodríguez Papers documents the development and process of significant theatrical productions in Jesusa Rodríguez's career as a theater director and performance artist, as well as the publicity and press related to this work. Some of the works prominently documented are Donna Giovanni and El Concilio de Amor. Additional works also featured in the collection are Ambrosio o La Fábula del Mal Amor, Las Horas de Belén, Atracciones Fénix, Pastorela Extraterrestre, and Così Fan Tutte. A large portion of the collection also documents the productions and events of the alternative performance spaces that she and her partner, Liliana Felipe owned and operated, El Fracaso and El Hábito. A large portion of the collection, particularly productions staged between 1983-1994, consists of scrapbook binders containing press clippings, photographic prints, contact sheets, negatives, theater programs, promotional materials, and other ephemera. Other materials documenting her theatrical productions include a curtain backdrop for Donna Giovanni, correspondence, magazines, newspapers, scripts and notes, drafts of lyrics, sheet music, articles, printed images, photographs, flyer layouts, brochures, financial documents, promotional mailers, fellowship proposals and applications, CDs and DVDs containing audio, video, and data, festival programs, certificates, identification cards, invitations, scene sketches and other drawings, painted illustrations, set designs and blueprints, and a calendar. As a social activist, Jesusa was involved in the protests surrounding the 2006 election, the peaceful civil resistance movement, and the anti-transgenic corn (En defensa del maíz) movement. For several years in the early 2000s, she ran empowerment workshops for indigenous and peasant women in Mexico. These activities are documented with press clippings, workshop materials and letters from workshop participants, flyers, handouts, printed PowerPoint slides, articles, and CDs and DVDs containing video and data.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Well-known for her espectáculos, she steeped her performances in social and political commentary, and brought art into her activism. Although she is best known for her cabaret and political works, she has directed adaptations of diverse pieces, from William Shakespeare to Marguerite Yourcenar, opera to pastorelas.
</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Rodríguez studied at Centro Universitario de Teatro in Mexico City, and studied under director Julio Castillo, with whom she worked on several productions as a set designer, including Arde Pinocho. Early in her career she met her wife, Argentine singer and actress Liliana Felipe. They opened their first cabaret together, El Fracaso, and formed the theater group Divas A.C. with other actresses and playwrights. Divas A.C. would collaborate on many significant productions, including ¿Y cómo va la noche, Macbeth?, Trece señoritas: homenaje a Frida Kahlo, and most notably, Donna Giovanni.

An adaptation of Mozart's Don Giovanni, Donna Giovanni featured an all-female cast and toured across Europe. In 1988, Jesusa directed and starred in Oskar Panizza's El Concilio de Amor, which was also presented in several European countries and North America. In 1998, she first presented Las Horas de Belén in Mexico City, before staging the work Off-Broadway alongside Ruth Maleczech and Mabou Mines. 
</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Jesusa Rodríguez first opened the performance space El Fracaso before opening and running the famous Teatro Bar El Hábito with her wife, Liliana Felipe. They ran El Hábito from 1990 to 2005, and over this span of 15 years, transformed their alternative performance space into a symbol of Mexican independent theater. Jesusa directed and staged hundreds of shows at El Hábito with numerous artists. In 2005, El Hábito was passed on to another cabaret group, Las Reinas Chulas, who changed the venue's name to El Vicio.
</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Alongside Liliana Felipe and fellow performer Regina Orozco, Jesusa Rodríguez had also done extensive work with indigenous communities throughout Mexico. Between 2001 and 2004, they ran workshops on empowerment, sex education, and re-articulating Mexican masculinity. Their workshops incorporated their theater experience, and they ran twenty-one of these workshops for indigenous and peasant women and men across 18 states of Mexico.   
</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
Jesusa's work as a performance artist informs her political and social activism, blending performance and protest into creative or artistic activism. She was involved in protests against substituting native corn for transgenic corn and the purchase of Monsanto by Bayer. She was also a part of the peaceful resistance movement and headed Resistencia Creativa, a movement that used "massive cabaret" as a political action tool. The movement was purportedly born in El Hábito, out of Mexico's highly contested 2006 general election and the political polarization and crisis that followed. With the election of conservative ruling party candidate Felipe Calderón by a fraction of a percentage, presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador immediately challenged the legitimacy of the election and its results. López Obrador and his supporters, including Resistencia Creativa, led mass protests, marches, and acts of civil disobedience, which culminated in a massive rally in Mexico City's historic Zócalo on July 30, 2006.
