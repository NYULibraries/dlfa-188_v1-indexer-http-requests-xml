    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials in this subseries relate to the former ruling family of Iran and subsequent legal actions taken by the State of Iran against the family, suing them for their assets.  These files relate to the Plaintiff who in this particular lawsuit was Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister of the late shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As background, in January 16, 1979, the Shah and his wife, the empress, left Iran to live in exile after the overthrow of government and installation of Ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini.  The Ayatollah, attempted to seek extradition from any country the Shah would visit or go to and also sought to seize all of the Shah's assets.  The Ayatollah also called for the assassination of the Shan and numerous family members. The Shah came to New York City on Oct 22, 1979 for medical care and this visit led to the Iranian Hostage Crisis.  After seeking refuge in other countries, the Shah finally settled in Egypt where he died July 27, 1980.  The hostages were not released until January 20, 1981 after an agreement was negotiated, the Algerian Accords.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The suit in these files refers to that brought against the royal family by the country of Iran.  The case was brought to the attention of O'Dwyer and Bernstien when the Shah came to New York City for medical attention. In the opinion of the lawyers, the Ayatollah was attempting to continue its revolution in the courts of the United States by attempting to take from the Royal Family via judicial process what it could not take by force.  Iran was asking the Unites States court to intervene in a political dispute between two ruling regimes in a foreign country: The Khomeini regime and the Pahlavi regime.  Brian O'Dwyer argued that New York has no responsibility to provide the type of forum that the Plaintiff - the government of Iran â€“ should be providing and therefore the suit was considered illegitimate.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Princess, Ashraf Pahlavi was known as an advocate of women's rights and the material documents her frequent travel to other countries promoting women's rights.  She was exiled from Iran in 1951 because of her "political meddling and general objectionable behavior". She was allowed to return permanently in 1954 (See folder FOI Request Documents, 1946-1959).</field>
