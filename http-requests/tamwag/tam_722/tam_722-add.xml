    <field name="bioghist_teim">Eliot Katz (1957- ) is an American poet and activist. In the fall of 1976, as a student at Rutgers University, Katz met the prominent writer Allen Ginsberg. Over time, Katz developed a relationship with and became Ginsberg's apprentice. His interest in human rights causes and poetry was influenced greatly by Ginsberg. As a longtime resident of New Brunswick, New Jersey, Katz worked with Middlesex Interfaith Partners with the Homeless (MIPH) as an advocate for homeless families and individuals. He was a cofounder and former editor of Long Shot literary magazine, and his poems appear in numerous anthologies, including Blue Stones and Salt Hay: An Anthology of Contemporary New Jersey Poets and Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. He is the author of books of poetry, including: Space and Other Poems for Love, Laughs, and Social Transformation, Unlocking the Exits: Poems, Les voleurs au travail/Thieves at Work, and coeditor of Poems for the Nation: A Collection of Contemporary Political Poems. Katz currently resides in Hoboken, New Jersey.</field>
