    <field name="abstract_teim">Harry Turner (1919-1997), born in Brooklyn, N.Y., joined the Communist Party in the 1930s, left in the aftermath of the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, became a Trotskyist, and was a member of the Socialist Workers Party (1964-66), then helped establish the Spartacist League, but left it in 1968, then participated in various U.S. and international Trotskyist organizations until his death. Turner was also a rehabilitation counseler, working for the New York State Office of Vocationa Rehabilitation, and an activist in the New York State Civil Service Employees Association. The collection contains published and unpublished writings by Turner -- newspaper articles, pamphlets, statements, newsletters, and circular letters -- the latter two often relating to the many Trotskyist organizations in which he participated. Materials also include correspondence, reports, newsletters, and ephemera documenting Turner's engagement with various Trotkyist and socialist organizations. The Trotskyist Coordinating Committee, Collective Leadership Faction (CLF), and the Committee for a Revolutionary Socialist Party (CRSP) are particularly well documented. Other groups in the collection include the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP), International Socialist League (ISL), International Workers League (IWL), and the International Workers Party (IWP).</field>
