    <field name="bioghist_teim">Alex Bittelman, Communist activist and theoretician, was one of the founders of the Jewish Communist movement in the United States. Born in the Ukraine, Bittelman was active in the Jewish Labor Bund before emigrating to the U.S. in 1912, where he joined the Socialist Party. In 1919 he helped lead the left wing of the SP into the newly established Communist Party, and became secretary of its Jewish Section. He became closely associated with William Z. Foster throughout his Party career until his expulsion in 1959. After prosecution and attempted deportation (as he was not a U.S. citizen) under the Smith Act, he served three years in federal prison. For many years he wrote the "Questions and Answers" column for the Daily Workerand the "Review of the Month" column for the Party's theoretical magazine, The Communist(later Political Affairs). He served as a member of the Party's Political Bureau at various times.</field>
