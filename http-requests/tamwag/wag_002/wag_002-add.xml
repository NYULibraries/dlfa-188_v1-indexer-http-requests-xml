    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records consist for the most part of photocopies of Regular (i.e., membership) Meeting and Executive Board minutes, agreements and newspaper clippings. (Original materials were loaned to the Wagner Labor Archives by Local 147.) The minutes reflect collective bargaining, work rules, and the changing ethnic composition of tunnel work. Also included are original printed copies of a constitution, an agreement, Working Rules booklets and a CD copy of a 2005 television program about the "sandhogs."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Compressed Air and Foundation Workers' Union was chartered by the American Federation of Labor in 1904 and merged with the International Hod Carriers', Building and Common Laborers' Union of America in 1918. Local 147, representing New York metropolitan area "sandhogs" was formed from the merger of Locals 45 and 102 in 1938. Local 102 itself was formed through the merger of Locals 63, 67 (northern New Jersey), and 68 (Newark, NJ). Members have been employed in all major sewage, water, subway and traffic tunnel construction in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area. Originally composed almost exclusively of Irish and English skilled workers, the union has gradually been opened to minority workers since World War II. In 1978 the union formed a Political Action Committee, funded by a voluntary check-off of three cents per hour, and his since engaged in vigorous political lobbying on issues of concern to members, including health and safety. According to Paul E. Delaney's Sandhogs: A History of the Tunnel Workers of New York (New York: Longfield Press, 1983), which includes several interviews with local members, Local 147 has a well-deserved reputation for democratic practice and member participation.</field>
