    <field name="abstract_teim">Bruce D. Boling is a linguist, historian, and librarian whose research focused on the Irish language with specific emphasis on the English dialects spoken in Ulster. He also collaborated with historian Kerby A. Miller on several projects related to Irish immigration history, including Irish Immigrants in the Land of Canaan: Letters and Memoirs from Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1675-1815. This collection documents Bruce Boling's research on the Irish language. Materials include maps, memoranda, correspondence, transcriptions and annotations of research material, journal articles on various aspects of linguistics, and original writing concerning aspects of English and Irish language dialects in Ulster. The collection provides resource materials not only on the history of Irish immigration and the changing nature of regional linguistic patterns, but also the way in which social scientists interrogate the intersection between linguistics and social history. The collection also documents developments in the field of Irish American historiography, including Boling's interdisciplinary focus and methodology.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents Bruce Boling's research on the Irish language. Materials include maps, memoranda, correspondence, transcriptions and annotations of research material, journal articles on various aspects of linguistics, and original writing concerning aspects of English and Irish language dialects in Ulster. The majority of the collection consists of materials produced in the process of researching and contributing to Irish Immigrants in the Land of Canaan: Letters and Memoirs from Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1675-1815, including copies, transcriptions, and translations of 18th- and 19th-century Irish immigrants' letters to family members. The collection provides resource materials not only on the history of Irish immigration and the changing nature of regional linguistic patterns, but also the way in which social scientists interrogate the intersection between linguistics and social history. The collection also documents developments in the field of Irish American historiography, including Boling's interdisciplinary focus and methodology.</field>
