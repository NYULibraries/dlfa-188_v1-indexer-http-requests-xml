    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The FitzSimons Family Letters consist of letters sent to and from members of the FitzSimons family in Ireland, the United States, and Rhodesia, between 1941 and 1977.  The majority of the letters are addressed to the film actress Maureen O'Hara, who was born Maureen FitzSimons.  Other letters in the collection are addressed to O'Hara's first husband, William Price, as well as her mother and three of her siblings.  The majority of the letters are from Bernard FitzSimons, one of O'Hara's uncles, and date between 1941 and 1946.  These letters consist of news of O'Hara's parents and siblings, as well as other relatives and family friends.  FitzSimons also discusses ways in which World War II affected Ireland.  Another large group of letters consists of those sent to O'Hara by her parents, her daughter, and one of her sisters during the summer of 1956, when her daughter Bronwyn was visiting the family in Ireland.  These also consist of family news, detailing family visits and trips over the summer.  There is a small number of letters sent to O'Hara and her mother by family friends, with similar topics to the bulk of the collection.</field>
