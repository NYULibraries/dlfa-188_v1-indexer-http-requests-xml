Bernstein's work with Human Rights Watch (HRW) is documented through correspondence, clippings, meeting agendas and minutes.  Topics in these materials include human rights issues in Israel, Palestine, and China, with the bulk of the correspondence pertaining to HRW's and Bernstein's responses to events in the Middle East in particular.  The collection contains material documenting Bernstein's relationship with other human rights and charitable organizations, including the Sigrid Rausing Trust, the Bard Prison Initiative, Legal Services for Children, Human Rights in China, and his relationships with Chinese dissidents Xu Wenli and Wei Jinsheng.

The materials filed under Series IV are a mix of material both unique and duplicative of that which exists in Series I through III.</field>
