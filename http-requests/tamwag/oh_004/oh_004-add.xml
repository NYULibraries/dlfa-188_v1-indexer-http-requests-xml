    <field name="abstract_teim">The collection is comprised of interviews with 26 organizers, which were conducted by Geoffrey Fox as part of a study entitled "Hispanic Organizers and Business Agents." The study was published as an occasional paper of New York University's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies in 1984. It explored how Hispanic immigrants were assimilated into labor organizations and how they, in the process, adapted and reformed these organizations for themselves. 

Interviewees were mostly members of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. Except for four New York-born Puerto Ricans, all interviewees are immigrants from Latin America, including: Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Chile, and Honduras. Interviewees discuss their careers, experiences in the industry and unions, organizing methods, and views on the labor movement.</field>
