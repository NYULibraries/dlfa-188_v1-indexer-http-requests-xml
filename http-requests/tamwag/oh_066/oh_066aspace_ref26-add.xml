    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!) Reunion was recorded on video on October 15, 2005.  The event is opened by former head of Tamiment Michael H. Nash who discusses the relationship between Tamiment and WHAM!, Carroll's dissertation project, and the work of the Tamiment Library.  Levin shares a slideshow of images from WHAM! events and direct actions.  Carroll discusses her dissertation topic and her relationship with the former members of WHAM! with whom she conducted oral histories.  The bulk of the reunion focuses on the presentations of Staniszewski, Tepper, Cole, Wolf, and Levin who each discuss how they became active in WHAM! and the importance of WHAM!'s work.  They focus on what made WHAM! special; the coalitions WHAM! formed with other activist groups, especially ACT-UP and the Reproductive Rights Coalition; and the ways in which WHAM! impacted each of them individually.  The remainder of the recording includes people from the audience sharing their experiences with WHAM!.</field>
