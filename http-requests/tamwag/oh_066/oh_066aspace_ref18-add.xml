    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted at Matuschka's apartment by Tamar Carroll on July 19, 2005.  The interview covers Matuschka's introduction to activism, her experiences with breast cancer and how it led to her joining Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!), and her experiences with WHAM!.  Matuschka discusses her breast cancer diagnosis in 1991, her malpractice suit against her doctor, and the art and articles she created as a result.  She relates her experiences with different breast cancer and women's organizations in New York City, including SHARE, 1 in 9, the National Organization for Women (NOW), National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations (NABCO), and WHAM!.  She describes her artwork and the direct actions she helped create at WHAM!, all designed around focusing on bringing people's attention to the realities of breast cancer and educating women from diverse racial, ethnic, and class backgrounds about breast cancer.  Matuschka discusses her decision to focus on WHAM! and the differences between WHAM! and SHARE, in particular, including the issues on which each focused and the way each organization functioned.</field>

In 1991, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy and chemotherapy.  While in chemotherapy, she learned that a lumpectomy could have been performed but that her doctor did not inform her of this option.  She brought a medical malpractice suit against her doctor and became involved with a number of breast cancer and women's organizations, including SHARE, 1 in 9, the National Organization for Women (NOW), National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations (NABCO), and WHAM!.</field>
