    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Tamar Carroll on July 19, 2004 at an unspecified location.  The interview was recorded in a crowded location and is often hard to understand, as there is a lot of background noise.  The interview covers Diane Curtis's membership and participation in the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and the Women's Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM!).  Curtis discusses her introduction to activism in the early 1980s when she came out as a lesbian and became involved in gay rights issues, first in California and then after her move to New York City (NYC) in 1985, and the way in which ACT UP's use of the Silence=Death posters led her to join the organization.  She discusses the way in which the Webster v. Reproductive Health Services Supreme Court decision in 1989 crystallized for her how abortion rights were not safe and that this decision led her to join the Reproductive Rights Coalition (RRC).  She discusses the differences between members of the RRC who belonged to more conservative organizations and younger members coming from ACT UP, and how this led to the creation of WHAM!.  She explains the way WHAM! meetings worked, the fact that they used Robert's Rules of Order to run the meetings, and the ways in which this made it difficult for people to hijack meetings and made it easier for more shy people to participate.  Other topics include WHAM! agendas apart from abortion access, the similarities between ACT UP and WHAM!, and the way in which WHAM! affected the later careers of its members, including Curtis.</field>
