There are numerous pamphlets outlining the organizations' positions on various issues. In addition to the material put out by the organization at the national level, there are also files from NAM chapters, including from Radcliffe-Harvard, Austin, and from chapters in and around the Chicago and New York areas.

The collection contains the material surrounding negotiations of the merger.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New American Movement (NAM), a self-identified "new type" of socialist organization, held its founding convention in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1972. Established largely by veterans of the New Left, NAM wanted to move beyond the activism of the 1960s and rejected a vanguard approach to organizing. The group was opposed to the Vietnam War and called for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. NAM's overarching goal was to create a democratic socialist society, characterized by racial, sexual and economic equality. In 1982, the organization joined with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee to form the Democratic Socialists of America.</field>
