    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials in this series focus mostly on the activities of Local 100 (New York City bus and subway workers), Local 101 (Brooklyn Union Gas utility workers), and Local 234 (Philadelphia transit workers). TWU figures frequently represented in these materials include Union President Michael Quill, Union President Matthew Guinan, Union Vice President Frank Sheehan, CIO Director Allan Haywood, and Local 100 President Ellis Van Riper. Former New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. is also depicted giving campaign speeches to the Union.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) was founded in New York City in 1934 by subway workers. It soon became the bargaining agent for all New York City bus and subway systems, and branched out to form locals across the country. By the early 1950s, the Union's membership had grown to over 100,000 and included members from both public and privately-owned transit lines. By the 1960s, TWU locals were also established among railroad, airlines, utility workers, and taxi drivers. The TWU actively supported equal rights for Black Americans. In the decade following World War II, it fought for a five-day, forty-hour week for its members. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Many of the TWU's founders were Irish immigrants who came to the United States after the Easter Rising of 1916. Among them was Michael J. Quill (1905-1966), a Kerry native and subway ticket clerk who led early organizing efforts for the TWU and became its first president. He was elected to two terms on New York's City Council, was the chairman of the City's CIO Council, and later served as a vice president on the AFL-CIO's executive council.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">From its early days, the TWU made use of radio and moving images to communicate with its members and the general public. It recorded important meetings, produced hundreds of radio advertisements, filmed Union soapbox speakers and rallies, and documented TWU field days and victory rallies during World War II. In 1941, the Union produced its first film, United We Are Invincible, which told the story of the union's strike against New York City bus lines. This was followed by several other films commissioned by the Union. The TWU also embraced the new medium of television in early 1951, when it launched its first television program. Most of the Union's programs were made by professional filmmakers and producers, including Paul Miner, Tom Costigan, and Leo Seltzer.</field>
