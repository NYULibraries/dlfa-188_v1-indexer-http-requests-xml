    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The New York City chapter was the founding chapter of the National Organization for Women. Their website includes information on the latest news and events regarding NOW-NYC, Women of Power and Influence awards, their priorities, and ways to get involved. NOW's priorities include reproductive rights, constitutional equality, LGBTQIA+ rights, promoting diversity, violence against women, and economic and social justice. Crawling of their website began in 2007, and focused on misogyny in media and the Supreme Court decisions to uphold the Federal Abortion Ban. In 2008, a more complete capture of the website was taken and included issues of their newsletter, whatNOW (dating back to 2005); action campaigns related to New York's Reproductive Health Act, the Clinic Access Bill, the Freedom of Choice Act, sex-trafficking, and emergency contraception prices; their political action committee and endorsements; photo galleries from protests; and their Service Fund and legal clinics which provides legal assistance and other support regarding discrimination, domestic violence, and other issues. In 2009-2013, the website contained efforts to support marriage equality, midwifery reform, Anti-Strangulation Bill, divorce reform legislation, subsidized child care, sexual violence programs, the publication of sex crime statistics, Disclosure Law for pregnancy service centers, insurance coverage of contraception, equal pay, discriminatory advertising practices, Reasonable Accomodations for Pregnant Workers Bill, Violence Against Women Act, and funding for Planned Parenthood. In September 2010, they launched the Take Rape Seriously Campaign. The website also included report cards on how politicians voted on bills supported by NOW-NYC.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In 2013, the website redesigned and promoted action campaigns related to the Women's Equality Act, ending sexual harassment in all workplaces, pay equity, pregnancy discrimination, protecting abortion clinics, birth control access, and fighting human trafficking. In 2014-2017, campaigns included sexual assault in the military, the women's equality agenda, expansion of family court judges, the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores Supreme Court case, untested rape kits, funding for sex-trafficking victims, holding NFL players accountable for domestic abuse shackling of incarcerated women during childbirth, consent education to schools, the Helms Amendment, ending child marriage, holding police accountable for violence, campaigns against President Trump's cabinet selections, stopping anti-choice legislation, immigration and rufugee ban, and birth control access. In 2018, NOW worked to against Trump presidency agenda, such as preventing Brett Kavanaugh from being confirmed to the Supreme Court (which was unsuccessful) and get out the vote efforts. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In 2019, the website redesigned to its most recent iteration (as of this writing). Action campaign categories focused on by NOW-NYC include resisting President Trump's agenda, New York City elections, reproductive healthcare, reproductive justice, equality and justice, changing laws, and workplace rights. Campaigns through 2022 included holding the NYPD accountable to survivors of sexual assault, madating sexual education for public school students, ending gun violence, ending abusive practices for home healthcare workers, closing the NY State Intoxication Loophole, and protecting abortion.</field>
