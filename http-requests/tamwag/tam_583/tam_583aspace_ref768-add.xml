    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes negatives, black and white prints, and color prints of Carl and Helen Winter's political and professional activities, including events they attended, trips overseas on behalf of the CPUSA, campaigns and protests, as well as family photographs and portraits of CPUSA leaders. Photographs primarily document political and professional activities on behalf of the CPUSA and the Daily World, which Carl Winter edited, and include trips in the 1960s and 1970s to Mongolia, Romania, Germany, and France to cover the French General Strike in 1968, and photographs taken inside the Daily World offices in New York City. Includes several photographs and negatives, apparently taken for the Detroit News, of Carl and Helen Winter at the Leon Mosely demonstration in Detroit in June 1948. Family photographs are included in Carl Winter's memorial album. Prominent individuals and CPUSA leaders appearing in the photographs include James Jackson, Henry Winston, Benjamin Davis, Ollie Harrington, and Yevgeni Yevtushenko. </field>
