    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is comprised of 6,827 black and white negatives divided into 570 separate shoots.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The images reflect Daniel Nilva's photographic work for labor unions, as well as his political interests and affiliations. Union photographs include images Nilva shot (mainly in New York City) for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union; American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees; Hotel and Restaurant Employees and Bartenders International Union; International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers; Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; the International Longshoreman's Association, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. While many of the images are of meetings and banquets, a significant part of the collection also documents strikes and demonstrations; of particular interest among these images are the 1951 New York waterfront wildcat strike, surveillance photographs shot during a strike, the Teamsters' Ketcham strike of 1955, the Seafarers Strike of 1950, a 1956 civil rights rally in Madison Square Garden, a public meeting supporting the Hungarian revolution of 1956, a demonstration by dressmakers in the 1950s, and May Day parades of the 1930s. Nilva's photographs that relate to the Communist Party (Opposition)--a splinter group of the U.S. Communist Party--are especially noteworthy and include images of a CPO-related meeting at its headquarters at the New Workers School, in which striking murals by Diego Rivera are visible as background. The collection also includes images of and events sponsored by progressive organizations such as the Harlem Labor Center and the American Veterans' Committee. The collection contains a sampling of Nilva's non-union clients, which included charitable organizations such as the Deborah Hospital and Sanitorium and the City of Hope (both founded to treat and eliminate tuberculosis) that received considerable support from trade unions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Individuals are documented as well--either in portraits or group photographs, including David Dubinsky, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jay Lovestone, George Meany, Harvey Olnick, Bertram Wolfe, Charles Zimmerman, New York City Mayor Robert Wagner, and friends Bernard Seaman and Val Burtan. Nilva also occasionally made copy shots of historical labor-union or political photographs. These images have been retained in the collection as they may no longer exist in other collections and may now represent unique photographic documents.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Each series is comprised of "shoots." A shoot is a group of photographic images shot by the photographer of one event--usually, but not always, on the same day. Each shoot has a unique identifying number (selected individual images within shoots have also been assigned individual numbers). The container list for this finding aid includes a complete list of shoot-level descriptions for all the images in the Collection; in the container list, shoot numbers are listed in the column for "item." Shoot descriptions include Nilva's original captions, as well as clarifications, corrections, identifications, and additional visual details provided by the processing archivists. These additions are enclosed within square brackets, so that they may be distinguished from the original caption information.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Selected shoots or portions of shoots have been microfilmed (R-7850) to provide reference access and must be viewed in this format; original negatives not microfilmed may also be viewed by researchers. Contact the repository for a complete list of shoots from this collection that have been microfilmed, with reel and frame numbers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">You can also click on the link within the shoot record itself in the container list below. Those shoots in which some (or occasionally all) negatives have been microfilmed are indicated in the Container List by: Microfilm. Researchers wishing to know if a complete shoot has been microfilmed can compare the number of images in a given shoot (in the Table of Contents below) with the number of images from that shoot they find microfilmed.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In order to help researchers quickly ascertain what this large Collection includes, a Collection Table of Contents listing all the Collection's series and clients, with their date ranges and the total number of images they contain, has been provided as a convenient overview (in contrast to the detailed, shoot-level descriptions in the Container List) of collection contents:</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Daniel Nilva was born in New York City on March 7, 1914, the only child of Joseph Nilva and Eva Bloom, Russian Jewish immigrants. Joseph Nilva worked as a painter-in a shipyard, and gilding and painting moldings of buildings--and as a pushcart peddler. Eva Nilva worked as a fan dancer on the popular stage; she taught Nilva to dance and he performed on stage with her as a child. Nilva's parents were divorced by the time he was in his teens, and may have separated earlier. In any case, it appears that between the ages of six and thirteen he was moved around considerably, living with each of his parents in turn, and then sent to board with and attend school with friends in the Midwest, in Omaha and Chicago, and finally to a farm in Roscoe, New York, where he lived until he completed high school. Nilva became close to the farm family and a lifelong friend of Leon Becker (later a criminal court judge), who also boarded at the farm. It was here that Nilva acquired his first camera, a Brownie box camera.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The 1930s were a formative time in Nilva's life- personally, politically, and professionally. He returned to New York City, where he attended Cooper Union, studying engineering for four years, although he did not graduate. He married Alice Mildred ("Millie") Elkes and became friends with three men to whom he remained close the rest of his life--Bernard Seaman, a labor cartoonist, Morris Stone, later an official with the American Arbitration Association, and Dr. Valentine Gregory Burtan, a heart specialist who had been imprisoned on a counterfeiting charge. Nilva also joined the Communist Party Opposition (a splinter group of the Communist Party, led by Jay Lovestone), and in early 1933 he went to work as a photographer for the Education Department of Local 22, Dressmakers, of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU). Millie Nilva appears also to have been associated with Local 22 and may have worked there. Nilva documented functions and activities of the Local with his camera and photographed for the ILGWU newspaper, Justice. He did freelance work for the Bookkeepers Stenographers and Accountants Union's newspaper, The Ledger,as well. His primary cameras were a Leica Model G and a 4x5 Speed Graphic.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1937, Nilva's employment with Local 22 came to an end. The following year he sat for and passed New York City's civil service examination for photographers. At the recommendation of Jay Lovestone, he applied directly for a job with the president of the Civil Service Commission, but evidently was not successful. Nilva was rejected for military service in World War II because of his extremely poor eyesight. During the war, he worked in New Orleans at an aircraft factory. After that he had considerable difficulty finding work before landing a full-time job at the New York Public Library in an unknown capacity. By the 1950s, however, Nilva was working full-time as a freelance photographer in New York City, and maintained a studio at at least one address (Broadway and 27th Street). His clients included a variety of labor unions and progressive organizations.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Nilva's marriage to Millie Nilva did not last long. The couple had no children and were separated for nearly twenty years before divorcing. Nilva met his second wife, Sheila Cole, a writer, in 1957, when she was 27 years old. They married in 1964. Their daughters, Daniella and Stephanie, were born in 1965 and 1966. The family lived in a townhouse at 222 E 11th Street in Manhattan. Daniel and Sheila Nilva's early years together were a financial struggle; they had difficulty paying medical bills when he suffered a heart attack. Moreover, because of the heart attack's toll on his health, he was forced to cut back on his photography. By the mid-1960s, however, Sheila Nilva had opened an antique shop, which they then both ran -- featuring cameras and photographica, among other items -- that eventually became successful enough to support the family. The Nilvas -- partly underwritten by Sheila Nilva's freelance assignments as a travel writer for the New York Times, Harpers Bazaar, and Ladies Home Journal--traveled extensively in North Africa and Europe (as well as throughout the United States and the Caribbean). Nilva died September 15, 1984, of a heart attack, at the age of seventy.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Nilva's photographs appear in the collections of the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives at Cornell University, and in the Manuscripts Department of the Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</field>
