    <field name="unittitle_ssm">Irish Republican Club  events: A set of posters announcing events sponsored or cosponsored by local includings: The Only Penetrable Point of a Tyrant is Fear of Death; Support the IRA (with Dick Tracy saying it, a bestselling poster); Bloody Sunday: A Commemoration (advertising a commemoration cosponsored by the IRCs and IAAA); A Spirit Thus Outraged Will Ever Turn and Come Again Demanding Justice (7 items)

Note: Some of the posters were created by a group of anarchists who were sympathizers and used to work at the Starry Plough pub in Berkeley. Those posters had a TTG (Tree Toad Graphics) or Potato Underground or Pu logo.

The last poster is an interesting case.  A few years later the graphic and words showed up on the cover of The Plough, the newsletter of the Official Republican Movement is South Down/South Armagah:

Posters and graphics, as well as people, moved back and forth between Ireland and the U.S. In this case, between Berkeley, California and Newry.
