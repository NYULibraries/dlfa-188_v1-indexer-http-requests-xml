    <field name="unittitle_ssm">Free Bill Quinn (1 item)  Note: This was a poster carried at demonstrations fighting Bill Quinn's extradition to England. Quinn was a San Francisco Irish American who had been recruited to the Provos by Chuck Malone. He was with the Provos for a few years then returned to San Francisco. He was arrested by the FBI on an extradition warrant by the British government and charged with shooting and killing a British policeman in London. He was extradited and served some time in jail. What's interesting about the photo is the graphic. The graphic of the man behind bars was one that the Officials used for Cabhair, their prisoners' aid group (see folder on Cabhair in Series I). It also appears in issues of the United Irishman before the Official IRA declared its ceasefire. There is some irony in the this in that the image was later used by a group supporting a Provisional IRA man. </field>
