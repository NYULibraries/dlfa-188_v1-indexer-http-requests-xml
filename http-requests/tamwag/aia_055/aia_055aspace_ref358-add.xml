    <field name="unittitle_ssm">History in the Making: A Day of New Irish Film and various posters advertising cultural events (12 items) Note: Poster by the Irish Film Society of San Francisco listing a day of new Irish film at the Roxie Theater. Irish Film Society material is also found in Series I.  Other posters contain information on festivals, plays, and the Bloomsummer festival sponsored by a short-lived Irish Community Television program.  The poster for the Irish Fair at Fort Mason includes a graphic from the cover of program from an Irish Fair in 1894 (crossed Irish and American flags with a shamrock over both of them). John Jones has the original 1894 program in his collection and loaned it so the organizers could use the graphic. One small poster advertises a set of classes/workshops by the New College Irish Studies Program (See also Dan Cassidy Papers, AIA 049).</field>
