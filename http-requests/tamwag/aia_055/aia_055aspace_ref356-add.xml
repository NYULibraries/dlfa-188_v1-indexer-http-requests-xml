    <field name="unittitle_ssm">Batalion de San Patricio / A Flag to Fly  Note: Poster and folder collected in Mexico during the 1993 tour organized by the Irish Mexican Association (3 items). The IMA was organized by Pat Goggins who was also the organizer of the Irish Forum. Prominent members included Chris Matthews of the IRC in Santa Cruz, and Marco Gonzalez, who lead a group of Mexican Army re-enacters.  In addition to marching in both the St. Patrick's Day Parade and the Cinco de Mayo Parade in San Francisco, IMA lead a tour to Mexico to watch and participate in San Patricio memorials and to the California border to investigate conditions for illegal immigrants trying to cross the border. Mark Day, a documentary film maker in San Diego (and former Franciscan priest) was involved at the San Diego end. Mark had written a screenplay about the San Patricios  and also produced a short documentary about them. Chris Matthews had written a play about the San Patricios called "A Flag to Fly" that was produced in Santa Cruz and Berkeley (and possibly Ireland).  Folders about Chris Matthews and IMA are also found in the collection in Series I. </field>
