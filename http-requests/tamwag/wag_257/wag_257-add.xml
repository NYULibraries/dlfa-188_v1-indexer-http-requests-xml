    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series: I. New York City, Regional Theatres and Touring Productions/Companies, consists of programs for productions produced in New York City, theatres around the country, touring productions including out-of-town tryouts, and touring companies. The series is arranged alphabetically. The general files that begin each letter are chronological then followed by an alphabetical list of productions and companies. A production is listed individually primarily if it has had more than one production, is of theatrical significance, or ran for an extended period of time.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series: II. Equity Library Theatre, New York City, Equity Library Theatre (ELT)produced productions from 1944-1989 as a showcase for Equity talent. Because they were a seasonal company the programs for this series are chronological. Production lists and other ELT activities such as children's theatre, informal presentations and benefits are included in the files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Actors' Equity Association (AEA) is the union of professional legitimate stage actors and stage managers. It was founded in New York City in May 1913, but did not gain full recognition as the bargaining agent for actors until the historic strike of 1919.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">AEA negotiates contracts and agreements that often affect a productions theatre program. Over the years rules regarding billing, program biographies, and Equity recognition in programs have become part of these contracts and agreements.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The bulk of the programs in this collection came from Paul Ross. An Equity stage manager, Ross was the publisher of the Players' Guide, a compilation of actors' photographs and credits arranged by sex and type. He collected these programs from Equity representatives who attended shows as well as from his own participation. He used them primarily to check credits for inclusion in the guide.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The staff of Actors' Equity also uses programs to determine if all contractual obligations have been fulfilled and if a member is under the correct contract (principal or chorus). Some of the programs in the collection, most often from the 1930s, include notes but it is unclear under what circumstances these notes occurred since Equity would usually put a program with notes in an individual production file.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Demonstrating the enormity and diversity of theatre in America during the 20th Century, the collection gives more than just a list of players in a given production. The programs offer a look into how productions were presented, how advertising changed over the years, and how some productions continue to be produced generation after generation.</field>
