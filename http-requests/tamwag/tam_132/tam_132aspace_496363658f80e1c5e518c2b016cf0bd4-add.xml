    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains film reels, video tapes, audio cassettes, video reels, and vinyl records collected by the Communist Party of the United States. Audio recordings in this series consist predominantly of labor and protest songs, which are performed by a variety of artists. Other audio recordings contain educational content including history lessons on Karl Marx and World War II, and English-Russian phrases. Films make up the bulk of this series and consists of collected international documentaries and television programs, the majority of which were created in the Soviet Union. Other films in this series were collected from a wide range of communist countries and are in a variety of languages including Korean, Spanish, German, Czech, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Videos include a collection of documentaries and programs on labor demonstration in the United States, progressive activism, the Cold War, and international social movements. Information about the content of films, videos, and audio recordings in this series has been derived largely from labels and annotation on the individual items. In several cases annotations provide an incomplete information, and in others the content of the recordings is unknown. These materials consist of a mixture of commercially produced and original recordings. Songs from demonstrations and performances of the "Internationale" are largely original content while other collected folk songs and lecture series materials are commercially produced. Likewise, films contain commercially produced content including foreign documentaries and television programs from the Soviet Union. A small portion of these films also contain amateur content as well.</field>
