    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries contains recordings of television and radio programs produced by the Communist Party. It primarily consists of recordings of three shows: the radio program Update, and the television shows People Before Profits and Changing America. Update was recorded by Communist Party Chairman Gus Hall beginning in 1985. Hall produced weekly cassette recordings discussing national and worldwide political trends. These recordings were played at the start of Secretariat and Political Bureau meetings and were also distributed to District Organizers and Clubs. The recordings were intended for internal Communist Party, USA membership and were used as a link between the national organization and district bodies. People Before Profits was a political talk show created by the Communist Party's Video Department beginning in the mid-1980s and running until 1990. The program was produced by the Party and sent to local and public access television stations across the United States. Changing America was the successor to People Before Profits, and ran between 1999 and 2000. Recordings of Changing America and  Update contain almost complete runs of each program, with only a few missing episodes, and largely consist of completed episodes. Recordings of the talk show People Before Profits are less clearly labeled, contain many overlapping episode numbers, and fragments of episodes. These programs show the ways in which the Communist Party reacted to current political issues and the ways the Party shared its stance on issues with rank and file members and the public. Unidentified fragments of program recordings are also included in this subseries. Although the programs for which they were created is unidentified they most likely relate to either People Before Profits or Changing America.</field>
