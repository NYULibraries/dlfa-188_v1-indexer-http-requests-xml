    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Communist Party USA website was first collected in late 2007. The website contained the party platform and constitution; reports and proceedings from conventions, conferences, committee meetings, and national conventions in the early 2000s; press releases; organizing around the 2008 elections; fundraising; the Manufacturing Think Tank; study and discussion guides; and news and their e-newsletter from their Organizing Department, the Party eBuilder. The website focused on many issues (called "struggles" by the CPUSA), including equality for Black, Native American, Mexican American, and Puerto Rican peoples; civil rights; culture outside of commercialism; economic democracy; public education; electoral politics; environmental protection; healthcare; immigrant rights; independent media; international communist unity; justice system reform; labor organizing; LGBTQIA+ rights; solidarity against war and imperialist globalization; protections for Social Security and Medicaid; protection from agribusiness; coalition building; and women's equality. In early 2010, the website was redesigned. The website redesign included information on their national convention held every four years; speeches; commentary; reports; their blog; an FAQ on the party platform and communism; and action campaigns and petitions related to climate change, net neutrality, Iranian sanctions and peace deal, Planned Parenthood, overtime pay threshold, free higher education, voter suppression, worker safety, protections for Medicaid and Social Security, Black Lives Matter, national budget, police brutality, and corporate interests in politics. In 2016, the website was redesigned to its current iteration (as of this writing). It contains educational resources; classes and quizzes on Marxism; their pdocast, the Specter; This Week @CPUSA discussion series; events;  and articles, videos, and local activities on their blog Party Voices.</field>
