    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The George Harrison Papers consist of correspondence, pamphlets, flyers, photographs, buttons, legal documents, memoranda, publications, research files, and material objects documenting Harrison's political activities and affiliations.  The collection includes materials from numerous organizations in which Harrison was active during the 1970s through the mid-1990s, especially the Irish American Defense Fund, the Irish Republican Socialist Committee of North America, the National Graves Association, and Republican Sinn Fein.  The materials, especially his collection of political buttons, also reflect his interest in liberation movements in South Africa, Cuba, Latin America, Palestine, and the Philippines.  The papers also document Harrison's 1981-1982 defense against charges of gunrunning to the Provisional Irish Republican Army tried in the Eastern District of New York Federal Court case U.S. vs. Harrison, Falvey, Mullen, Gormley, and Flannery.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">George Harrison (1915-2004) was a socialist and revolutionary Irish Republican who spent his life supporting the causes of oppressed peoples.  Harrison was born in Shammer, Kilkelly, County Mayo, Ireland on May 2, 1915.  As a youth he served in the East Mayo Brigade of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish Civil War (1922-1923).  He immigrated to the United States in 1938 and served as an infantryman in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of World War II.  In 1948 Harrison began working as an armored car guard with Brinks, Inc. but was suspended in 1981 because of criminal charges filed against him.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Harrison was arrested on June 23, 1981 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for violations of federal firearms laws.  He, along with four others, was charged with running guns to the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the high-profile U.S. vs. Harrison, Falvey, Mullen, Gormley, and Flannery case argued in the Eastern District of New York Federal Court.  Frank Durkan, also from County Mayo and a nephew of New York City lawyer and politician Paul O'Dwyer, represented Harrison, acknowledging that Harrison had shipped guns to Republicans in Ireland but arguing that American's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was complicit in the act.  He was acquitted in 1982 and subsequently reinstated by Brinks with back pay in accordance with the order of a federal labor arbitrator (see folder Local 807 IBT vs. Brinks).  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">He retired from the company in the mid-1980s, but remained active in political causes, including opposition to racism and apartheid, as well as providing aid to Palestinians, Chileans, and other victims of poverty or injustices.  Through his life, Harrison was active in many charitable endeavors, like providing funds to build a new parish church in his native town during the 1950s.  He supported Irish American organizations that advocated the union of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, and came to the aid of Irish Republican prisoners held in the United States, Ireland, or Great Britain.  He supported socialist political causes, but was also active in the New York City mayoral campaign of David Dinkins and the presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson and Bill Clinton.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">George Harrison died at his home in Park Slope, Brooklyn on October 6, 2004.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Materials were donated in 1999 and 1997 by George Harrison, and in 2005 by Franck Durkel of O'Dwyer &amp; Bernstien, executor of George Harrison's will.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">George Harrison contacted the Archives of Irish America in 1997 through Angela M. Carter, at that time proprietor of Irish Books and Graphics.  Ten boxes of material were accessioned from Harrison's apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn by Marion Casey in November 1997 and an additional eleven boxes of books and testimonials were donated by O'Dwyer &amp; Bernstien in April 2005, acting as the executors of Harrison's estate.  The accession number associated with this collection is 1997.069. Posters and framed memorabilia found in repository were added to this collection in 2015. The accession number associated with these materials is 2015.043. George Harrison sent an additional box of posters and memorabilia related to his involvement in human rights activism in 1999. The accession number associated with this gift is 2017.006.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">In 2017, several t-shirts and a hat related to political rallies and campaigns were assessed as having minimal research value and were removed from the collection. These items had been included as part of a 1999 accretion added to the collection in 2017.</field>
