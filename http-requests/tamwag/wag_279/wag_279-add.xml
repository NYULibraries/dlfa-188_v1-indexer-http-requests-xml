    <field name="abstract_teim">Mack Trucks, Inc. relocated its Plainfield, New Jersey, plant to Hagerstown, Maryland, in 1961. The United Auto Workers negotiated a new agreement with Mack Trucks that was not supported by all the members of the Plainfield local. A court case (Lawrence Giordano et al. v. Mack Trucks, Inc.) was brought in the U.S. District Court District of New Jersey by a small group of plant workers who had formed a group called "Mack Workers Committee for Vested Rights."  This collection contains court documents, correspondence, newspaper clippings and other materials that relate to the relocation and legal dispute.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains Normal Forer's papers relating to the dispute surrounding the relocation of a Plainfield, NJ Mack Truck plant to Hagerstown MD. Court documents (Lawrence Giordano et al. v. Mack Trucks, Inc.), newspaper clippings and correspondence describe the actions of Mack Trucks, Inc., leading up to the relocation, their dealings with workers and the union, and the case brought by the Mack Workers Committee for Vested Rights.  Also included are committee minutes, copies of several union agreements and a number of fliers, announcements and other material associated with the relocation. In addition, there is documentation of an appeal made by Lawrence Giordano and other members of UAW Local 343 to the international union protesting the manner of the vote on the Shop Separation and Transfer Agreement in October 1961. The appeal was denied. Also of interest is a detailed study of the relocation dispute and how it affected Mack workers -- "The Mack Case: A Study in Unemployment."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On October 31, 1961, the Mack Truck Company shut down its engine and transmission manufacturing plant at Plainfield, New Jersey, and moved its operations to Hagerstown, Maryland.  Lengthy negotiations between Mack Trucks, Inc. and UAW representatives had culminated in a new "Shop Separation, Pension and Transfer Agreement."  A small group of plant workers (members of UAW, Local 343) were dissatisfied with aspects of the agreement, contending that Mack had ignored "vested rights" of union members obtained through prior contracts.  These employees established a group -- Mack Workers Committee for Vested Rights -- and filed suit against the company seeking a restraining order to halt further hiring in Hagerstown and asking monetary damages.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lawrence Giordano was Chairman of the Committee and Norman Forer, its Secretary.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On March 19, 1962, the US District Court, District of New Jersey, issued an opinion dismissing the complaint and ruling that the plaintiffs were bound by the separation agreement of their UAW union and the defendant Mack Trucks, Inc.</field>
