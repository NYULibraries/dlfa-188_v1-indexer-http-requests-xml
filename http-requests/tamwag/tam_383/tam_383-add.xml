    <field name="abstract_teim">Jeanne Mirer practices labor, employment and civil rights law in New York City. She has been an active member of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) since the 1970s, and has served in various capacities. She is currently the NLG International Committee Co-Chair, President of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL), a founding Board Member of the International Commission for Labor Rights, and a Board Member of the Sugar Law Center. Mirer has been an integral part of the founding and leadership of the International Commission for Labor Rights. She earned her J.D. from Boston University and B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh.

Materials in this collection (bulk 1972-1979) document Jeanne Mirer's work in various positions of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), as well as other national and regional committees that she was a part of, such as the Affirmative Action/Anti-Discrimination National Committee, the Minority Legal Resources Task Force (MLRTF), the Michigan Coalition to Overturn the Bakke Decision (MCOBD), and the National Committee to Overturn the Bakke Decision (NCOBD). The majority of Mirer's National Lawyers Guild materials pertain to her role as National Treasurer for the organization, and her work on the National Finance Committee (NFC). Materials include meeting agendas and minutes, correspondence, memos, reports, newsletters, circulars, subject files, ephemera, court transcripts, and legal briefs. The majority of the collection pertains to affirmative action, in particular, the cases of United Steelworkers of America v. Weber (referred to as Weber v. Kaiser in the collection), and Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. 

While much of her professional activism took place on a national level with NLG's National Office (NO) and National Executive Committee (NEC), Mirer also had very city-specific work in Detroit, Boston, and New York City. Some of the work that she did in these cities pertained to affirmative action, criminal justice reform, labor unions, and pollution.</field>
