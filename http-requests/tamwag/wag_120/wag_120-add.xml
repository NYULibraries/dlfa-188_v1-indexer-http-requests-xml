    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local 2090 of New York City was created in 1918 and disbanded in 1944.  Between 1937 and 1940, Local 2090 was involved in a dispute with the national union and legal proceedings regarding amendments to the general constitution of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, the revocation of Local 2090's charter, and its reinstatement by the New York Supreme Court.  After the General Convention of 1936, Local 2090 led a campaign in opposition to amendments to the general constitution specifically directed at the Communist Party.  In early 1938, the local published and widely circulated a pamphlet stating their case, and its charter was subsequently revoked on grounds that this activity violated one of the new amendments.  Local 2090 filed a legal suit in civil court and were ultimately victorious.  The legal process took several years, during which time the local's membership steadily decreased.  In 1944 it was disbanded and replaced by Local 2155.</field>
