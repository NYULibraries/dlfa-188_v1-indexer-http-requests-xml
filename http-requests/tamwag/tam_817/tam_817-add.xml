    <field name="abstract_teim">Danny Yung (1943- ) is an artist, experimental filmmaker, producer, choreographer, and urban planner. Yung was a founder of The Basement Workshop, an Asian American political and arts organization for writers, visual artists, dancers, and activists. He is also the founding member and co-artistic director of Zuni Icosahedron, an experimental theater in Hong Kong where he currently lives and works. The Danny Yung Papers (dated 1969-2015) consist of materials created and collected by Yung documenting his career as an artist, experimental filmmaker, producer, choreographer, and urban planner. Materials in this collection include ephemera, correspondence, research files, original writings, and publications that document Yung's engagement with research and community outreach projects in Chinatown during the late 20th century, as well as the founding and ongoing activities of The Basement Workshop, including the publication of the organization's Bridge magazine. These materials document not only the founding and operations of Basement Workshop, but also the intersection of artistic expression, political organizing, and community activism inherent to the Asian American movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The collection also includes materials concerning the founding and ongoing activities of Zuni Icosahedron, an experimental theater in Hong Kong. This collection also includes an oral history interview with Yung predominantly focused on his involvement with The Basement Workshop.</field>
