    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series V contains material related to the union organizing work of David Sullivan. It is presumed that these materials relate to work he himself engaged with, but there could also be material related to work he simply collected on. The Series is broken down by union, first the United Autoworkers and then the United Steelworkers of America. This Series highlights the activities of rank and file activists within these two unions and their various locals. Material from the United Autoworkers largely comes from the ALCOA plant in Cleveland and includes a folder of grievances that Sullivan filed with the union. There are numerous locals represented from the United Steelworkers of America, most with small runs of bulletins and newsletters from rank and file activists within the local. These include Local 1014's Coke Plant Breeze and the Mill Hunk Herald. Political fliers and brochures related to the campaign of James Balanoff for President of District 31 are found in this Series as well as material related to other union election campaigns.</field>
