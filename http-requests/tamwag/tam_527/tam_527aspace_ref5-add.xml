    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III contains material generated by and about the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters, a faction of the Revolutionary Communist Party that broke away following the downfall of the Gang of Four in China in 1976. Material in this Series dates from the organization's formation in 1977, including its paper Voices of the Rebellion, which announces the group's separation from the RCP and goes through 1984. In this Series, material is divided by district, committee, and regional as well as by topic and format. While a portion of this Series is printed and public, including district and national bulletins, fliers, journals, and pamphlets, the majority consists of internal documents. Folders contain drafts and memos on such pertinent topics as, agitation and propaganda relating to the development of a organizational newspaper, the black national question, busing in Boston, Cook County Hospital, the equal rights amendment, fusion between the workers movement and the social movement, the international situation mostly pertaining to the situation in China following the death of Mao Tsetung and the Three Worlds Theory, the national question, and the woman question. Of note are lengthy itineraries, reports, and correspondence from a visit to China in 1979-1980. The Boston, Chicago, and New York City districts are most heavily represented in this Series. Folders outlining the RWH's political campaigns surrounding African Liberation Day and May Day contain fliers and reports. Central to this Series is the RWH's work with uniting Marxist-Leninists in the United States. There are folders outlining lengthy merger discussions with the Bay Area Communist Union, the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the Committee to Unite Marxist Leninists, and the League of Revolutionary Struggle. At times discussions lasted over the course of several years. Heavily important to the RWH was its work in trade unions and the trade union movement. There is a sizable amount of material in this Series, which outlines various trade union strategies and involvement in the auto, electrical, mining, and steel industries.</field>
