    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I contains material generated by and about the Revolutionary Union and its local collectives, including the leading Bay Area Revolutionary Union. The material ranges in date from 1970-1978 and is divided by committee, local, district, and regional, as well as by subject and format. While a portion of this Series is printed and public and includes calendars, fliers, national and district bulletins, pamphlets and publications, a majority is internal. There are drafts of the Revolutionary Union's theoretical paper, Red Papers 5 and 6 as well as position papers on factionalism and developing the political line of the working class. Of note are folders concerning among other things: the expulsion from the Revolutionary Union of Bruce Franklin, his wife Jane Franklin, and Janet Weiss, a history of the East Coast Regional, and correspondence regarding the RU's security measures and stance on gay liberation. There are also folders with material about the Revolutionary Union's stance on the 1972 McGovern Presidential campaign, as well as their positions on party building, democratic centralism, and recruitment. Material pertaining to the Revolutionary Union's political campaigns surrounding farm workers, international women's day, may day, students, tenants, trade unions, the unemployed, and veterans is evident in this Series.</field>
