    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV contains material generated by the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (CPML), which dates from 1976 when the organization changed its name from the October League up through 1981. While there are public and printed documents in this Series in the way of district and national bulletins and pamphlets from The Call and Call Publications, most of the material is internal. A large portion of this Series is made up of reports from various districts and regionals. These consist of page long, occasionally hand-written briefs outlining political campaigns and recruitment work going on in the CPML's districts and regionals around the country. Another sizable portion of this Series consists of notebooks filled with minutes and notes from meetings of the Political Bureau and the Standing Committee. There are a number of folders containing material from the CPML's commissions and fractions, including the Afro-American, National Trade Union, and National Women's Commissions and the Azanian Support, National Lawyers Guild, and the Southern Conference Education Fund Fractions. Of note in this Series is material pertaining to the expulsion of Martin Nicolaus as well as a resignation letter from civil rights activist Lyn Wells. Like Series III, there is material related to various merger negotiations amongst U.S. Marxist-Leninist organizations, including the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters and the New Voice.</field>
