    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II contains material generated by and about the Revolutionary Communist Party and dates from the Party's founding in 1975 up through 1982. Material is divided by committee and district as well as topic and format. While a portion of this Series is printed and public, including district and national bulletins, constitutions, fliers, pamphlets, and publications, it largely consists of internal documents. Folders contain drafts and memos on central topics such as busing, China and the Gang of Four, Iran, political education, students, and trade union organizing. Of note are folders containing material related to the founding congress, including committee reports and resolutions as well as main political reports, the split with the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters, and speeches from the Mao Tsetung Memorial in 1976. Material from the Revolutionary Communist Party's political work surrounding International Women's Day, the July 4th Bicentennial, and May Day is represented in this Series with fliers, drafts, and political reports. There is also material related to the RCP's involvement in organizing with the National United Workers Organization, the Unemployed Workers Organizing Committee, and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.</field>
