    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was founded on June 27, 1905 in Chicago by representatives from 43 groups. The organization was established in response to the wage system of capitalism as well as the organizing methods of the American Federation of Labor. At its founding, the IWW sought to include all industrial workers in order to create One Big Union that would effectively gain better workers' rights, such as increased wages, fewer hours, and improved working conditions. Some of the founding leaders included Daniel De Leon of the Socialist Labor Party, William D. Haywood of the Western Federation of Miners, and Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party, who later withdrew his membership as the IWW became more radical. Although often employing militant tactics, the IWW also utilized protest methods that espoused the philosophy of "folded arms." In which they would withhold their labor from employers. Some methods of this included slow downs and massive sickouts. The IWW preferred "striking on the job" over traditional striking and picket lines as workers would often lose their jobs during strikes to scabs. In addition, many IWW members engaged in free speech fights. The IWW encouraged its members to openly recruit new members and voice grievances. They would consequently get arrested and put in jailâ€”costing cities a lot of money. These methods proved effective as free speech bans were often lifted, such as in Spokane, WA in 1909. In 1912, the IWW had an estimated 50,000 members from various industries. In 1923, the IWW saw the height of its membership with roughly 100,000 members. In 1924, the IWW suffered a split due to two differing organizing visions, that of the centralists and the decentralists. The centralists called for the universalization of the IWW, eventually resulting in the IWW taking over the functions of the federal government. Meanwhile, the decentralists envisioned a free industrial society, in which independent local groups would organize and establish laws as they saw fit. After the 1924 split, the IWW saw a decline in membership, but continues to be active today.</field>
