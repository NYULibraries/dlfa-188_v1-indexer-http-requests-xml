    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III. Political Organizations and Activities contains committee, club, and branch meeting minutes, convention proceedings, discussion and position papers, reports and memos, correspondence of Breitman and others, and FBI files. There is coverage of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) from its inception, although the greatest concentration of material is from the 1950s-60s and from 1982-85, the period leading up to, and immediately after Breitman's expulsion. For the Newark and Detroit clubs, there are minutes, typescripts of Breitman's talks and lectures, and documentation of Breitman's several runs for public office. Many files deal with views of the USSR, the Shachtman/Workers Party split, Pabloism, and the Cochranite split, including: "Toward Brass Tacks," by James Burnham, 1939; W. Roark (Trotsky) Letters re Opposition, 1940; "Shamefaced Defensism," by Dwight MacDonald, 1940; "Russian Theses," by E. R. Frank, 1948-49; "Pabloism revisited" by Peng, 1955; and an account of a (confidential) interview with Louis Adamic, 1950. Significant files on African Americans include resolutions written by R. Kirk, 1953; "Why white radicals are incapable of understanding black nationalism," by R. Vernon, 1963; the SWP Black Fraction, 1967-68; and various Breitman lectures and resolutions. Files from the late 1970s - early 1980s document Breitman's political differences with the SWP line, his expulsion and the aftermath. The James Kutcher FBI files pertain to the case of this legless World War II veteran who in 1948 was dismissed from his job as a Veterans Administration clerk in Newark, NJ because of his SWP membership. The other FBI files document the Detroit Friday Night Forum, and the case of the SWP vs the U.S. Attorney General (1980s).</field>
