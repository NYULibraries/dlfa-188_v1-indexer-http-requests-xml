    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Organizational records of general membership include a considerable number of agendas and attendance lists for general meetings and a small amount of minutes.  Mailings to members, including newsletters and bulletins informing members about upcoming legislation and issues in Congress or about direct action embodied in upcoming demonstrations, titled "Legislative Alerts," and "Action Alerts," together with flyers for CNICA events chronicle the events and activities of the organization, as do files on specific CNICA-sponsored events and projects like benefit concerts, walkathons, and its sister city initiative.  In addition to these, the organization's belief in the legislative process as a driver of political change is documented in files of correspondence and on letter-writing and petition campaigns to members of Congress.  Mailing lists, larger and longer than meeting attendance lists, reflect the large number of sympathetic supporters the organization was trying to reach for funds and participation in larger actions like demonstrations, if not for regular active involvement in the organization.  Internal organizational files contain hand- and type- written agendas, notes, planning and position papers of CNICA's Steering Committee (which set the direction of and drove the organization at large), and "telephone trees" identify many of its principal organizers as well as documenting the use of a central tool to communicate with and mobilize its members and supporters in between CNICA monthly meetings.</field>
