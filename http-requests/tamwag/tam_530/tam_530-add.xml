    <field name="abstract_teim">Painter Ben Morea, and artist and sculptor Aldo Tambellini were both anarchists active in the artistic and political counterculture in New York City in the 1960s and 1970s. Aldo Tambellini edited and published a newsletter called The Screw with its slogan "Artists in an Anonymous Generation Arise." In 1966 Ben Morea and the poet Dan Georgakas founded a Dada-influenced art group called Black Mask. In May 1968, Black Mask changed its name to Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers. The Motherfuckers (often referred to as simply "the Motherfuckers", or UAW/MF) were an anarchist affinity group based in New York City's Lower East Side. They contributed to New York City's counterculture by setting up crash pads, serving free food, starting a free store, and helping radicals connect with doctors and lawyers. They used direct action to stage various political-artistic events and demonstrations, and are thought to have inspired members of the Weather Underground and the Yippies. This collection contains clippings, fliers, graphic art, periodicals, posters, photographs, programs and other printed ephemera that document Morea and Tambellini's activities both during and before the founding of Black Mask, and the activity of the Motherfuckers. There is also correspondence and other material relating to the Situationist International, several annotated issues of the Rebel Worker (Industrial Workers of the World), and correspondence and other materials created or collected by donor Max Blechman that also pertain to anarchism and its relationship to the arts.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Painter Ben Morea, and artist and sculptor Aldo Tambellini were both anarchists active in the artistic and political counterculture in New York City in the 1960s and 1970s. Aldo Tambellini edited and published a newsletter called The Screw with its slogan "Artists in an Anonymous Generation Arise." In 1966 Ben Morea and the poet Dan Georgakas founded a Dada-influenced art group called Black Mask along with elements of another group called Angry Arts. Black Mask produced a broadside of the same name and declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth." In May 1968, Black Mask changed its name and went underground. Their new name, Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers, came from a poem by Amiri Baraka. Often referred to as simply "the Motherfuckers", or UAW/MF, they were an anarchist affinity group based in New York City's Lower East Side. They contributed to New York City's counterculture by setting up crash pads, serving free food, starting a free store, and helping radicals connect with doctors and lawyers. This "street gang with analysis" was known for its direct actions in the fields of politics and the arts, and is said to have inspired members of the Weather Underground and the Yippies.They were opposed to and resisted on principle any attempt to impose order on the political demonstrations they participated in. Among other things, the Motherfuckers instigated brawls with Maoist groups such as the Progressive Labor Party.</field>
