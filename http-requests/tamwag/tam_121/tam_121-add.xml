    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains flyers and brochures, newsclippings and pamphlets, posters. Ventana receives these from returning delegations, mailings from other organizations, and individual donations. The ephemeral nature of much of the material will make this collection a valuable source of information about the wide range of activities in response to the U.S. policies toward Nicaragua. The documents from Nicaragua and reports by North American eyewitnesses provide sympathetic coverage and more accurate evidence of Nicaraguan reality than is generally available in the U.S. These include reports on the contra activities, the Miskitu Indians, the Nicaraguan elections, the history of the literacy campaign, and the trade unions.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ventana was founded by several individuals who had been with one of two delegations of cultural workers to tour Nicaragua in June and July 1983. The official structure and name was given in early 1984 with the participation of other more recently returned delegates (in particular, a delegation of theatre workers, Dec. 1983).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">"We are North American artists and cultural workers who oppose United States intervention and destabilization efforts in Nicaragua, in Central America and the Caribbean. We support the people of the Americas in their right to self-determination and the right to govern in the interests of the majority of the people. Having witnessed the disastrous effects of U.S. foreign policy on the people of Nicaragua, we seek to change this policy through the use of our cultural skills and activities."</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Activities since its founding include sending additional delegations, hosted by the Sandinista Cultural Workers Association (ASTC), hosting in NY well-known painters and performers from Nicaragua, collecting cultural supplies as material aid to Nicaraguan arts organizations, and participating in solidarity and anti-war networks and coalitions. Using their firsthand accounts, individual members have written articles, plays, novels, films, reports and editorial letters. (The most outstanding accomplishment in this respect is Ventana delegate Reed Brody's front-page report on contra atrocities). Others have incorporated their experiences into theatre and musical performances, sculpture, photography, and paintings. Many have shown slides to friends, colleagues, school programs, etc.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The Ventana Collection was initiated by the Executive Committee of Ventana in late 1984 and the first papers officially received by the Tamiment Library on April 17, 1985.
