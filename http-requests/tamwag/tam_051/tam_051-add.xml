    <field name="abstract_teim">The New American Movement (NAM) was established in 1972 by veterans of the New Left who wanted to move beyond the activism of the 1960s and rejected a Communist "vanguard party" approach to organizing. NAM's overarching goal was to create a democratic socialist society, characterized by racial, sexual and economic equality. In 1982, the organization joined with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee to form the Democratic Socialists of America. This collection contains conference and convention materials, correspondence, meeting minutes and agendas, position papers, reports, educational materials, and printed ephemera. The collection also contains some files on other socialist and left organizations, some of which contain discussion of NAM's relations with these organizations.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New American Movement (NAM) was established in 1972 by members of the New Left movement, the anti-war movement, and the socialist feminist women's movement. The founders wanted to form an explicitly democratic socialist and socialist feminist organization that rejected all forms of authoritarianism. NAM was committed  to internal democracy and required that women make up at least 50% of all leadership bodies; members did not want to have a single, long-term, male leader. NAM's overarching goal was to build a mass movement for a democratic socialist society. NAM saw this movement in opposition to oppression based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and class. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
NAM was an activist organization with over forty chapters, primarily based in the Midwest and the West Coast. NAM emphasized political education for all its members on the chapter and national levels.  Several chapters organized evening Socialist Schools with classes on both practical and theoretical topics. Members worked in unions, community organizations, and local political campaigns, and were active in movements or reproductive justice, LGBTQIA+ rights, Nixon's impeachment, an end to the war in Southeast Asia, and South African and Central American solidarity. NAM chapters also held outreach forums and cultural events. NAM published a newspaper, New American Movement, and Moving On magazine. NAM also produced the internal newsletter Discussion Bulletin, and topical outreach pamphlets. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
In the late 1970s, NAM began merger negotiations with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) to build a democratic socialist organization combining the different generations and geographical locations represented by the two organizations. In March 1982, negotiations concluded, and DSOC and NAM joined to form the Democratic Socialists of America. </field>
