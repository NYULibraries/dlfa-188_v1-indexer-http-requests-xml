    <field name="bioghist_teim">Majority Report was a feminist newspaper published in New York City from 1971-1979. Although the oft-named editor of the paper is Nancy Borman, the paper was published through an editorial collective, with Borman guiding the paper from its establishment.  For the majority of its run, Majority Report was published biweekly, its circulation is recorded as being from 11,000 to 20,000.Majority Report was initially launched by the Women's Strike Coalition, a New York based women's rights activist group, but subsequent issues were published through the group Feminist Organization for Communication Action and Service (FOCAS). As a "collective newsletter" seeking to unify women's liberation groups and to alleviate the costs of an independent publication, Majority Report had a unique editorial policy: it published together and without edits, the individual newsletters of various women's liberation groups across the leftist political spectrum - liberal, progressive, and radical alike. Majority Report  was also known for its monthly calendar of feminist events, its directory of feminist businesses, and the feminist advertisements it ran. Noted contributors to the publication include Gay-Women's Liberation Front (G-WLF) and the National Organization for Women (NOW).</field>
