    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund was founded in 1974 to advocate for the civil rights of Asian American communities through litigation, education, and support for community organizing. The website was first crawled in September 2007. It contained press releases describing legal battles pertaining to Asian American civil rights, as well as a list of the AALDEF's programs, including 9/11 disaster response, Affirmative Action, anti-Asian bias, anti-trafficking initiative, economic justice, educational equity, equal access to services, immigrants' rights, leadership development, and voting rights. In 2010, the website was temporarily replaced with a page explaining that the website was under construction. In 2011, the website was relaunched with a new design. The update added a blog section written by Emil Guillermo that focuses on current events relating to political, legal, and social justice for Asian Americans. It also added separate sections for publications by the AALDEF and a litigation docket to read about their notable cases. In 2019, the website was once again updated, with the new design highlighting the AALDEF's Economic Justice for Workers, Immigrant Rights, and Voting Rights &amp; Democracy programs. The updated site contained a new section for press releases, which had formerly been published in the News section, while the News section began featuring articles written by external media outlets. The redesign also added a section for events hosted by the organization. In 2020, the website's blog also began featuring a podcast hosted by Guillermo. At the time this was written in the fall of 2021, the AALDEF's programs included anti-trafficking, Census 2020, economic justice for workers, educational equity, housing &amp; environmental justice, immigrant rights, voting rights &amp; democracy, and the #StopAsianHate Project.</field>

    <field name="appraisal_teim">YouTube Channel was added to attempt to capture the videos embedded in the website.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content.
