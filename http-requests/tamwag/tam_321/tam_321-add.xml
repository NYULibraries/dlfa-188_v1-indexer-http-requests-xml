    <field name="abstract_teim">Founded in 1974, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF) is a national organization that protects and promotes the civil rights of Asian Americans. By combining litigation, advocacy, education, and organizing, AALDEF works with Asian American communities across the country to secure human rights for all. The AALDEF focuses on critical issues affecting Asian Americans, including immigrant rights, civic participation and voting rights, economic justice for workers, language access to services, Census policy, affirmative action, youth rights and educational equity, housing and environmental justice, and the elimination of anti-Asian violence, police misconduct, and human trafficking. The Asian American Legal Defense Fund Records principally contains legal case files (many are closed), principally labor law cases, most involving restaurant and garment industry workers, but also including immigration cases. There are also labbor-related arbitration files, and subject files on the Chinatown Labor Fair, and on immigration, labor, and housing.</field>
