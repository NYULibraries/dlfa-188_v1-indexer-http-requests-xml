Correspondence primarily relates to the work of CPD founder and head Joanne Landy. The collection also contains Landy's personal notebooks, research materials for an application for a MacArthur Foundation writing grant for a project titled "The Role of Western Economic Policy in the Transformation of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union", and documents created by various Non -Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
Audio visual materials in this collection include two boxes of cassette tapes and VHS recordings of CPD board meetings, lectures, forums, and conferences in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Recordings feature discussions on topics on trade, United States economic power, and Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union. They also include some recordings of programs from WBAI Radio on similar topics.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Campaign for Peace and Democracy (founded in 1982 as Campaign for Peace and Democracy/East and West) is dedicated to advancing a progressive and non-militaristic U.S. foreign policy -- one that encourages democracy and social justice by promoting solidarity with activists and progressive movements throughout the world. The Campaign opposed the Cold War by calling for "detente from below," engaging Western peace activists in the defense of the rights of democratic dissidents in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and enlisted East-bloc human rights activists against U.S. policies in countries like Nicaragua and Chile. Along with the European Nuclear Disarmament Movement, the Campaign built grassroots solidarity across the Cold War divide, and refused to "choose sides" in the East-West conflict.</field>
