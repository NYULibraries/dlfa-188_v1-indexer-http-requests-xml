    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series III. Photographs and Printed Materials, 1909-1953</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III contains 26 photographs (XIV:D) that are arranged in chronological order and include portraits of August Claessens, group photographs, photographs of Claessens with other socialist figures, and photographs of Claessens teaching at the Rand School. Each photograph has been labeled with a number in the lower right-hand corner of the picture. These numbers correspond with the description of the photographs in the complete reel list. There are also approximately 20 photographs of Claessens and his family and friends which have not been microfilmed.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The printed matter in this collection (XIV:E) is organized into the following seven subject files: (1) Claessens legislative bills, New York State Assembly; (2) election campaigns; (3) lecture announcements; (4) miscellaneous; (5) pamphlets; (6) socialist legislative bills, New York State Assembly; and (7) testimonials. Each subject file has been assigned a frame number, including each item in the pamphlets file.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The legislative bills constitute the largest bulk of materials in the printed matter series. These bills are divided into two files: (1) 16 bills drafted by Claessens from 1918 to 1919 (XIV:E:1); and (2) 74 bills drafted by the five socialist assemblymen during the period, January-April 1918 (XIV:E:6). The bills drafted by the five socialist assemblymen include legislation on the regulation of municipal street railway fares, municipal ownership of public utilities, repeal of the state police department, abolishment of the death penalty, regulation of child labor, reorganization of the City College of New York, expansion of workmen's compensation, free university education, and the establishment of municipal day nurseries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also includes five pamphlets which were written by Claessens (XIV:E:5). A bibliographical citation for each pamphlet in this file can be found in the complete reel list.</field>
