    <field name="abstract_teim">Joseph Long (1952- ) is the son of Irish immigrant parents from Arklow, Co. Wicklow and grew up in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. He has a Master's Degree in Irish and Irish-American Studies from Glucksman Ireland House, New York University, during which time he conducted the 11 interviews that comprise this collection. The interviews were conducted with several Irish Americans on the subject of growing up in New York City's Chelsea and West Village neighborhoods and focus on similar topics and themes, including educational institutions, the family structures typical of the neighborhoods, the ethnic and social composition of the neighborhoods, and sports and leisure (often associated with Greenwich House). Another recurring subject is the intersection of ethnicity, labor industries, and social interactions, with specific emphasis on the longshoremen of the Chelsea Piers.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of 11 oral history interviews conducted by Joe Long in 2011 and 2012 with several Irish Americans on the subject of growing up in New York City's Chelsea and West Village neighborhoods. Many interviews discuss similar topics and themes, including educational institutions, the family structures typical of the neighborhoods, the ethnic and social composition of the neighborhoods, and sports and leisure (often associated with Greenwich House). Another recurring subject is the intersection of ethnicity, labor industries, working conditions, and social interactions, with specific emphasis on the longshoremen of the Chelsea Piers. Several interview subjects discuss their professional careers, including police work, military service, and modeling. Some interviews are accompanied by a partial transcript of the conversation.</field>
