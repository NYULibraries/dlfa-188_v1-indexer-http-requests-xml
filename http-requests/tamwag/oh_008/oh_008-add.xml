    <field name="abstract_teim">The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is the second largest national teachers union in the United States and was founded by Margaret Haley in Chicago, Illinois in 1916.  As of 2021, its members include pre-K through 12th grade teachers; paraprofessionals and school-related personnel; government employees at local, state, and federal levels; college and university faculty and staff, and nurses and other healthcare professionals.  The American Federation of Teachers Oral History Collection consists of audio recordings of interviews with American Federation of Teachers (AFT) members, staff people, and officers, with a concentration on union activities in the 1950s and 1960s.  The interviews were conducted between 1985 and 1987, and topics include the role of women in the AFT, the Civil Rights movement and minority members within the AFT, opinions of past and present union leaders, the 1960 merger of New York City locals, and the Progressive Caucus.</field>

The interviews were conducted between 1985 and 1987 with members who were active throughout the United States, but most interviews focus on activities in New York, New York; Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; and East Coast cities. Topics include the role of women in the AFT, the Civil Rights movement and minority members within the AFT, opinions of past and present union leaders, the 1960 merger of New York City locals, and the Progressive Caucus.  Narrators include David Elsila, editor of The American Teacher, and David Selden, past president of the AFT.  Index summaries or transcripts exist for all the interviews, with the exception of Carl Megel, Fred Nauman, and Rebecca Simonson.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is the second largest national teachers union in the United States and was founded by Margaret Haley in Chicago, Illinois in 1916.  Haley served as the first national organizer and Charles Stillman as the first president.  Over the first four years of the AFT it claimed 174 locals and approximately 9,000 members.  During the 1930s membership increased in urban areas along with general labor union growth in cities and the AFT successfully lobbied for teacher tenure laws in 17 states. After investigations of Communist infiltration and influence in some locals, the AFT expelled two New York City locals and the Philadelphia union in 1941.  One of the New York locals went on to become the New York City Teachers Union.  During World War II, AFT locals in some cities won contracts through collective bargaining.  The AFT continued to emphasize the need for collective bargaining in the postwar period and locals began to strike for better wages in contract, with the St. Paul, Minnesota the first local to strike, in 1946.  In the 1950s, teacher discontent increased as wages in private employment continued to outpace teacher salaries and the battle for collective bargaining in education began in New York City.  Albert Shanker and David Selden brought about a merger of the fragmented New York locals in 1960 under the title of United Federation of Teachers within the AFT.  In 1960, the UFT won bargaining rights, and after a short strike in 1962, concluded a contract with the New York City Board of Education. The UFT victory in New York moved it into a dominant position within the AFT.  In 1963 the AFT national convention repealed its no-strike policy.  Attempts to effect a national merger of the AFT and the National Education Association (NEA) collapsed in the late 1990s.  In 2017, the AFT included over one million members in major cities across the United States.  As of 2021, its members include pre-K through 12th grade teachers; paraprofessionals and school-related personnel; government employees at local, state, and federal levels; college and university faculty and staff, and nurses and other healthcare professionals.</field>
