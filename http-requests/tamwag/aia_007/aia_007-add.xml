    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rosaleen Cahill was born in Ahascragh in County Galway, Ireland. She emigrated to New York in 1947 and began working in the restaurant business. Starting in 1953 she worked as the manager and hostess at Jim Downey's Steakhouse on Eighth Avenue in New York City, a restaurant popular with those in the theater business. Cahill also operated the restaurant's Irish Coffee Bar for many years. In 1964, Cahill managed the Irish Coffee Bar at the Irish Pavilion at the New York World's Fair. The Irish Pavilion's popularity attracted such well-known figures as Irish President Eamonn De Valera, actress Lucille Ball, and Irish singer Carmel Quinn.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Cahill married Patrick FitzGibbon in 1966 and continued to work at Downey's until 1968. That same year she and Downey opened the Irish Pavilion at East 57th Street in New York City, fulfilling their mutual dream of creating a center to "bring the authentic feeling and texture of Ireland to New York and to provide a forum for Irish artists to participate, make their contribution, and of course, find a market for their works." The Pavilion opened in June of 1968 with a gala celebration to benefit the Irish American Cultural Institute. Designed by Sean Kenny, the center featured imported foodstuffs, original artwork, books, and handcrafted woolens, glasswear, and tweeds. The shop also hosted live music four nights a week in its 100-seat restaurant and Irish Coffee Bar.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Following Downey's death, Cahill FitzGibbon took on business partner Nuala Devlin. Under their management, the Irish Pavilion remained a landmark in Manhattan for many years, attracting such musicians as The Chieftans and such artists as Beatrice Behan, Noel Sheridan, potter Philip Pearse, and weaver and basketmaker Patsy Duigan. In 1983, Cahill FitzGibbon and Devlin sold the Irish Pavilion to musician Tommy Makem (formerly of the Clancy Brothers), changing the name to Tommy Makem's Irish Pavilion.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Cahill FitzGibbon spent her retirement as an administrator at the Hunter College School of Nursing. She died in 2006.</field>
