    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the United Telegraph Workers largely consists of agreements, contracts and constitutions, as well as a few pamphlets and publications. Material comes from the predecessor Commercial Telegraphers' Union of America as well as from various divisions from around the United States and Canada, including the divisions that represented the Canadian Pacific System, the Associated Press System, the United Press System, and Western Union.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Telegraph Workers was known until 1968 as the Commercial Telegraphers' Union of America. Founded in convention in New York City in 1903, the Commercial Telegraphers' Union of America emerged from a series of struggles between smaller unions of private and postal telegraph workers. At the time, over one hundred delegates represented seventy-five locals from across the country. During World War II and throughout much of its history, the union had been pitted against a single dominant employer, Western Union. Due to technological change in the industry and charged anti-union efforts, the Commercial Telegrapher's Union of America declined in numbers after World War II. In 1986, the 5,800 member United Telegraph Workers merged with the Communications Workers of America.</field>
