    <field name="abstract_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the Peace and Freedom Party (U.S.) is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades.

There are fliers, circular letters, brochures, and other printed matter, highlighting the PFP's involvement in national and state elections as they tried to build a viable third party alternative in the United States.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the Peace and Freedom Party (U.S.) provides a selection of printed material produced by the Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) at the city, state and national level during the years of 1967-1971. The bulk of the material in the collection comes from California and New York, consisting of position papers, fliers and outreach mailings for the 1967 registration drive for voters in California. There is also printed matter from the 1968 New York and California state conventions as well. There are notable fliers and other printed material documenting the Party's presidential campaigns for Eldridge Cleaver and Dick Gregory, as well as the congressional campaign for David McReynolds. Also included are party platforms and principles from the first national convention held in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1968. There are numerous meeting and event fliers from New York City colleges and universities documenting the organization's role in progressive politics, including the student protests at Columbia, and the New York University Chapter's stance on Black Power, the Vietnam War and the democratic university.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Peace and Freedom Party (PFP) is a minor left-leaning political party. The PFP was founded in June of 1967, though the first national convention was convened in the summer of 1968. It was there in Ann Arbor, Michigan that the group nominated Black Power leader Eldridge Cleaver as their candidate for U.S. President. The PFP arose in opposition to the Vietnam War and in support of civil rights, women's equality and rights for workers. The PFP is still active today, primarily in California, nominating Ralph Nader for president in 2008.</field>
