    <field name="bioghist_teim">Owen Jefferson Smith was born in Moore, Montana in 1909, and grew up in Iowa. He received an MS in entomology from University of New Hampshire in 1933, and from 1933 to 1937 performed research in entomology at the New Hampshire State Agricultural Experiment Station. He enlisted in the International Brigades in March 1937 and fought for the loyalist forces in Spain for 22 months. During that time, he achieved the rank of Captain and fought at the battles of Jarama, Brunete, Belchite, and the Ebro Offensive. He began his career in the Brigade in the infantry, but was hospitalized after being wounded in the chest in August 1937. During his recovery he served as an administrative officer in the American hospitals in Spain. Smith resumed fighting in March 1938, and returned to the United States in December 1938. Between 1940 and 1948 he worked in labor relations as a field organizer for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), and later went on to receive a PhD in entomology from Ohio State University in 1950. Smith was under FBI surveillance between 1941 and 1952 for suspicion of communism and distributing communist literature.</field>
