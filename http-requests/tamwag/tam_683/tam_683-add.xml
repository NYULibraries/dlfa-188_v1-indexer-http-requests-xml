    <field name="abstract_teim">The North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) is a nonprofit organization that offers information and policy analysis on Latin America and its relationship with the United States, advocating for freedom from oppression and injustice in the region. Since its founding in 1966, NACLA's journalistic activism has brought English-language information to a variety of interested parties, including policy makers, students, and Latin Americanists. This collection consists of materials created and collected by NACLA that document the organization's policy and advocacy efforts, including memoranda, newspaper articles, photographs and other visual materials, publications produced and distributed by NACLA, and pamphlets and other ephemera collected by NACLA. The materials relate to a wide range of topics concerning radicalism concerning Latin America, with particular emphasis on guerrilla warfare, human rights, economic policy, and United States military intervention in the region. Although most Latin American countries are represented, the majority of the materials concern El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua during the countries' respective civil war years.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) is a nonprofit organization that offers information and policy analysis on Latin America and its relationship with the United States, advocating for freedom from oppression and injustice in the region.
