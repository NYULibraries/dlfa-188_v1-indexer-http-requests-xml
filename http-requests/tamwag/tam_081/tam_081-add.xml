    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This small collection consists of one record box of material generated and collected by Thomas Stamm during the course of his personal research, writing, and involvement with the Revolutionary Workers League. The majority of the collection consists of correspondence between Thomas Stamm and other individuals such as Max Schachtman, Carl Cowl, James T. Farrell, Meyer Shapiro, Robert J. Alexander and Edward Oehler. Copies of publications such as  Fighting Worker, Ahora, Political Notes, and the Marxist Worker are interspersed throughout the collection. There are four folders (53-56) that pertain specifically to Stamm's interest in the Trotsky assassination, although this topic may be present in other areas of the collection. There are 4 unidentified tapes on magnetic reels labeled 1-4 and accompanied by a typed transcript of a "tape 2" which may be the tape 2 that is present in this collection. Personal material related to Thomas Stamm exists in the form of his diary at the start of the collection. There are also many published and unpublished manuscripts and articles by Thomas Stamm, some of which are undated, although a possible date range could be ascertained by examining surrounding and related material in the collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Thomas Stamm [1904-1980s] was a U.S. Trotskyist and one-time member of the Political Committee of the Workers Party who opposed the Party's 1935 decision to attempt to enter the Socialist Party of the United States in an attempt to broaden its influence. With Hugo Oehler, he formed the Revolutionary Workers League (RWL). In 1937, the group renounced Trotskyism, but while Oehler concluded that Trotsky had split with Marxism  in 1934, Stamm held that Trotsky had degenerated in 1928, and the two split. Oehler retained the majority of the group, but Stamm set up a rival organization of the same name. This was some times known as RWL Revolt after its periodical, which ran Vol. I #1 March 26 1938 to Vol II #14 January 7, 1940.</field>
