    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series constitutes the largest part of this collection, and contains correspondence, financial papers, minutes, resolutions, statements, position papers, reports, and memoranda. The bulk of the New York City material is correspondence (X:81). Most of the correspondence pertains to the 1930s and early 1940s, although there are items from the early 1950s. The correspondence relates primarily to such routine organizational matters as establishing new branches and locals; scheduling meetings, rallies, and special conferences; recording dues and other membership information; handling literature requests; and sponsoring bazaars and theater parties. There are items in the correspondence, however, which convey information about the first SDF convention in 1937, financial problems affecting the SDF, the defection of Socialist Party locals to the SDF, SDF's relationship with New York City unions, the Moscow Trials, socialist refugees from Europe who worked with the SDF, the death of B. Charney Vladeck in 1939, the 1940 campaign to attract young people into the SDF, the formation of the Social Democratic Youth in 1941, the decline in SDF membership during the early 1940s, and the SDF Bazaars in the early 1950s. The principal correspondent in this file is August Claessens, but there are also numerous letters from Julius Gerber, George Field, James Oneal, B. Charney Vladeck, Jacob Panken, Louis Waldman, Lena Morrow Lewis, Sonia Teitelman, Leo Meltzer, Mark Starr, Algernon Lee, Sol Levitas, Alfred Baker Lewis, and Adolph Warshow.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other major files in this section are the minutes of the New York City Central and Executive Committee (X:83 and X:85, respectively) papers of radio station WEVD (X:88), and various miscellaneous items (X:87). The WEVD correspondence is especially interesting in that it contains information about programming, editorial viewpoints, and the use of air time by the SDF leadership. The miscellaneous file contains city convention reports and resolutions for 1945, 1946, and 1949; minutes of meetings which discuss the American Labor Party and New Leader controversies; Branch Officer and County Executive Committee minutes; and Grievance Committee reports.</field>
