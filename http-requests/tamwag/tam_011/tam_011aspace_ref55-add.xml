    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains files on 42 state branches, the District of Columbia, and four countries, including Argentina (X:50), Canada (X:51), Mexico (X:52), and Switzerland (X:53). There is also a file on the armed forces which is located between the state and international files (X:49). The largest files in this part of the collection pertain to state branches in California (X:8), Florida (X:13), Illinois (X:15), Massachusetts (X:25), and the District of Columbia (X:46). Most of the other state branches as well as the foreign countries have relatively small files. The state branch files are arranged in alphabetical order according to the name of the state. The international files are also arranged in alphabetical order and are located after the state branch files. Items within each state branch and international file have been arranged in chronological order, with undated items placed at the end of the file.</field>

Other interesting items within these files are the Indiana State Executive Committee minutes (X:18) and the Pennsylvania State Executive Committee minutes (X:37).</field>
