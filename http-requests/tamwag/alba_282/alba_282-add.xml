    <field name="abstract_teim">This is an open collection of miscellaneous periodicals that relate closely to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives at New York University; magazines and newspapers in the collection were published in Spain and abroad during the Spanish Civil War and in later years.  Although the provenance of many items is unknown, it is clear that some were separated from manuscript collections that form part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives at the Tamiment Library, NYU; others may have been brought from Spain as souvenirs by Lincoln Brigade members; and some purchased from dealers or given to archives over the years by collectors and others.  While some were produced in Spain during the war years and relate directly to the conflict, others may contain only an article or articles on the War and reactions to it around the world.  Individual publications in the collection were produced by many publishers and political entities, including a wide array of political and trade-union organizations.  The contents of the collection may change over time, as new donations are made.  Individual items in the collection have not been catalogued into the main on-line catalogue of New York University.  Publications have been set aside for inclusion in this collection for a variety of reasons.  Many titles are represented by only one issue; others are in such fragile condition that they may be handled only under the supervision of archives staff; in some cases the items in this collection are duplicate issues of titles that can be found in longer runs in the Library catalogue.  To be sure of locating the full range of Spanish Civil War-related periodicals available at the Tamiment Library, researchers should consult both this collection and the main on-line catalogue of Bobst Library, NYU.</field>
