    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VII: Photographs is comprised of black-and-white photographs that document Welsh's work for the CIO, AFL-CIO, and other labor organizations in Panama, Africa, and the United States, especially during the 1950s and 1960s. The series contains group shots and portraits of Welsh, mostly from his years in Africa. The images from Panama include shots of various meetings, banquets, and speeches (including several from the March of Dimes), as well as photographs of seamen at the Panama Canal. There are also images from the Summit of Independent African States in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia in May 1963 and three images from a folder labeled "Pictures - Africa," which consist of a group portrait featuring Welsh, an image of Welsh and another man holding up an embroidered shirt, and a candid photograph of Welsh and other men at the 14th Constitutional Convention of the CIO in 1952. Other images in the series are mostly photographs taken by news services of contemporary events in African nations during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a few postcards and some group shots and portraits of various individuals.</field>
