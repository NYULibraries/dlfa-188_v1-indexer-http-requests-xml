    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection represents a collective history of the Professional Staff Congress (PSC) of City Univeristy of New York. It includes interviews of former faculty and staff from institutions such as Borough of Manhattan Community College, Brooklyn College, and Hunter College who answer questions about their professional careers and their involvement in the PSC when at CUNY. The interviews chronicle the organization's path to becoming unionized at CUNY in the 1970s, the establishment and activities of the union's Executive Council, Delegate Assembly, and Grievance Counselors, and recent developments at PSC up until 2023. Interviews address topics such as administration policies, working conditions and wages, hiring practices, and union officer elections. One digital, black-and-white photograph illustrates a PSC-CUNY rally in New York City. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some of the interviews were on sound discs (CDs and minidiscs) at the time of donation and included printed transcripts of the interviews. Later accessions also include recordings and transcripts, but they were donated via flash drive. </field>
