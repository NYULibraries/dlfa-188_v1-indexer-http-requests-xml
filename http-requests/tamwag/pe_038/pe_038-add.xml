    <field name="abstract_teim">The National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC) Printed Ephemera Collection is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades. The NCLC, headed by Lyndon LaRouche, was purged from the Students for a Democratic Society in 1968 for supporting the New York Teachers Strike. Eventually the NCLC spawned the U.S. Labor Party, with LaRouche as their candidate for U.S. President, and the North American Unemployed and Welfare Rights Organization. The collection consists of printed ephemera put out by the organization nationally, largely fliers, fact sheets, press releases, and pamphlets. Also in the collection are materials from local NCLC chapters.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC) is a political organization headed by Lyndon LaRouche. Originally a caucus within the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) called the Labor Committee, LaRouche and his followers were purged from SDS in 1968 for supporting the Albert Shankar led New York Teachers Strike. The NCLC later went on to attack those on the left in what is known as "Operation Mop Up" as well as to form their own rival organizations, including the National Unemployed and Welfare Rights Organization and the Revolutionary Youth Movement. The NCLC also founded the U.S. Labor Party which supported LaRouche's candidacy for U.S. President in 1976.</field>
