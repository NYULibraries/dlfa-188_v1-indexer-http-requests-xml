    <field name="abstract_teim">Sam Brandon joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) as a teenager, and became an organizer for its New York section and chair of its NY State Committee. Expelled in 1927, he helped to found the Socialist Labor Propaganda League, the Industrial Union League (IUL) in 1928, and in 1933 the Industrial Union Party (IUP), and remained its leader, an advocate of the ideas of SLP founder Daniel De Leon, and a critic of the SLP until his death. This collection consists of correspondence and typescripts (principally of Sam Brandon), documents, ephemera, clippings, and some proceedings of various De Leonite organizations. Notable are the files from the 1920s and 1930s which closely document his expulsion from and ongoing disagreements with the SLP, and the founding of the IUL and IUP. Much of the collection covers the years 1970-1984, and documents Brandon's leading activities in several short-lived De Leonite political groupings. Correspondents include Joseph Brandon, Louis Lazarus, Ralph Muncy, and Arnold Petersen.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Sam Brandon Socialist Labor Party Papers (1900-1993) consist of correspondence and typescripts (principally of Sam Brandon), documents, ephemera, clippings, and proceedings of various De Leonite and other Socialist organizations. Notable are files from the 1920s and 1930s, which closely document, most importantly through Brandon's correspondence, his expulsion from and ongoing disagreements with the Socialist Labor  Party (SLP), and the founding of the Industrial Union League (IUL) and Industrial Union Party (IUP). The collection holds little material from the years 1940-1969. The remainder of the collection covers the years 1970-1984 and documents Brandon's leading activities in several short-lived De Leonite political groupings: the Socialist Committee of Correspondence (circa 1969), the Daniel De Leon League (circa 1970), Socialist Reconstruction (circa 1971), and the Revolutionary Industrial Unionists (circa 1979); his leadership of the reactivated IUP; and his criticism of the SLP. Other correspondents include Joseph Brandon, Louis Lazarus, Ralph Muncy, and Arnold Petersen.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sam Brandon joined the Socialist Labor Party (SLP) as a teenager and became an organizer for its New York section and chair of its NY State Committee. SLP leaders expelled the entire Bronx section in 1927 over political disputes. Brandon, his older brother Joseph, and others formed the Socialist Labor Propaganda League, then the Industrial Union League (IUL) in 1928. In 1933 Sam Brandon founded the Industrial Union Party (IUP). He remained its leader, an advocate of the ideas of SLP founder Daniel De Leon, and a critic of the SLP until his death. Brandon also founded RichLoom, a Brooklyn-based textile manufacturing company, whose profits supported his activism.</field>
