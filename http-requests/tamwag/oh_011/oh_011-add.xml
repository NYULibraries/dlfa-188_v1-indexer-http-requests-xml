    <field name="abstract_teim">The Transport Workers Union (TWU) was founded in 1934 and represented transportation workers in both the public and private sectors. TWU's New York City-based Local 100 was its largest branch, which encompassed transit workers in the subway and bus systems, as well as private bus and taxi companies.

The collection consists of interviews with officers, members, and staff of the Transport Workers Union. Subjects discussed mainly concern TWU history in the New York City area, but there are some references to union politics and activity on the national level. The collection also includes an audio recording of TWU songs.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Oral History Collection on the Transport Workers Union of America was initiated by Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives staff member Brenda Parnes in 1985 to fill gaps in documentation as she processed the papers of the union. The interviews were conducted by Parnes and Joseph Doyle from 1986-1988, then continued by Gail Malmgreen from 1990.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Transport Workers Union (TWU) was founded in 1934 by Irish immigrants and represented transportation workers in both the public and private sectors. By 1950, the TWU had organized transit workers throughout the nation and had chartered more than 100 Locals. TWU's New York City-based Local 100 was its largest branch, which encompassed transit workers in the subway and bus systems, as well as private bus and taxi companies. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Union President Mike Quill was influential in the union's activities from his election in 1935 until his death in 1966. In 1948, Quill and the union broke ties with the Communist Party of the United States of America, and communists were excluded from union membership thereafter.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the 1950s, the TWU was active in organizing for rail transport and airlines workers, as well as the civil rights struggles within the Southern labor movement. The TWU was the only international to hold out against the merger of the CIO with the AFL in 1955. In 1966, the union organized a transit strike and President Mike Quill passed away shortly after.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The collection was created for the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives by Brenda Parnes, Joe Doyle, and Gail Malmgreen in 1985. The accession number associated with this collection is 1985.006.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">In 2014, interviews with Ira Coleman-Polansky and Walter Nelson were removed from the collection. Coleman-Polansky's interview is present in the Oral History of the American Left Collection (OH.002) and the Communist Party of the United States of America Records (TAM.132). Walter Nelson's transcribed interview was outside of the scope of this collection.</field>
