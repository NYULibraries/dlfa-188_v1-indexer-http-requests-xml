    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Web archiving of the Cooper Square Committee's website began in 2009. The website then consisted of information related to housing and social services, tenant organizing, membership, and housing preservation. In 2011, the website went through a redesign focusing on organizing efforts; news; events; fundraising calls; information on the fundraising, accessbility, housing, and membership committees; testimonials; housing and social services; community development; annual gala; affordable housing resources; homeowner resources; and tenant rights resources with a specific focus on disability rights. The Cooper Square Committee focused on many special projects, including the Seward Park urban renewal, greening and weatherization, cooperative housing education, accessibility, rent laws and rent guidelines. The website also included the history of the organization, its by-laws, staff, and board members. In this version of the website, the e-Newsletter was available dating back to 2005. In 2012-2013, much of the website was focused on the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy on housing in the Lower East Side. In mid 2013, the website underwent a redesign and added sections in Spanish and Chinese. The website's content largely remained the same, but added a sections on stalled construction sites, Senior Health, Advocacy and Recreation Program (SHARP),  Real-Time Enforcement (RTE) campaign, Bea Arthur Residence youth housing project, and tenant safety, small business needs. In 2020, the website provided assistance on rent strikes and eviction moratoriums during the COVID-19 pandemic. In late 2020, the website was redesigned which highlighted their work with housing justice coalitions, predatory equity, lead dust abatement, and illegal hotels. The website also began to feature video in 2020.</field>
