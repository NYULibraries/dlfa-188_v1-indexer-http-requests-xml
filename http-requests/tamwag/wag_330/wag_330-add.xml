    <field name="abstract_teim">Sally Genn (1920-1985) was a labor publicist and activist. She worked as an assistant to several secretaries of the New York City Central Labor Council, edited the Council's Trade Union Handbook, and was managing editor of its monthly Labor Chronicle.

Notes, correspondence, programs, news clippings, conference materials, photographs, posters and fliers, and other materials highlight Genn's role in the New York City Central Labor Council, particularly her collaboration with various theatrical unions on behalf of the Council, and also document the Council, performing arts groups, and the labor movement in New York City more generally.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection documents Sally Genn's involvement in the labor movement in New York City through her employment with the New York City Central Labor Council and her leadership in other organizations. Notes, correspondence, programs, news clippings, conference materials, photographs, posters and fliers, and other materials highlight Genn's role in the NYC Central Labor Council, particularly her collaboration with various theatrical unions on behalf of the Council. Genn's writings and editorial work are represented in the 1975, 1977, and 1981 edition of the Trade Union Handbook, which Genn edited, and in an article she wrote for Labor Today. Other pamphlets, photographs, and news clippings collected by Genn document the Council and the labor movement in New York City more broadly.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Two United Housing Foundation scrapbooks of news clippings provide evidence of Genn's interest in the co-op movement. Also of note are notices, correspondence, and clippings from the anarcho-syndicalist organization the Libertarian Book Club, which Genn served as secretary; Labor Theater programs, posters, and reviews; and correspondence related to Genn's appointment as the Newspaper Guild of New York's representative to the Women's Trade Union League. </field>
