    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The American Jewish Left in the Digital Age collection documents the efforts, voices, and materials that have defined the American Jewish left in the twenty-first century. Focusing on the new publications, organizations, and activities initiated by the millennial generation of American Jews, this collection traces how these young Jews responded to cultural trends, political concerns, and technological transformations of the twenty-first century. The collection also documents how Jewish millennials have utilized activism to find Jewish social, cultural, and religious meaning and engagement. Subjects covered within the scope of this collection include the activities, writings, social media, and materials of publications and local and national activist movements have been run by millennials and have defined themselves as part of the wider Jewish left, consciously combining Jewishness with American leftist politics.</field>
