    <field name="abstract_teim">Charles A. Laverty (1930-2015) was a journalist and historian who was active in Irish republican organizations.  His research interests included the participation of the Irish in American wars, particularly the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.  He was a founding member of the Irish Brigade Association, an organization devoted to the history of the United States Army 69th Infantry Regiment, an historically Irish regiment created in 1849.   The Charles Laverty Papers date from 1767 to 2015, with the bulk of the material dating between 1960 and 2010.  The collection documents Laverty's research interests, his working life, his participation in Irish republican organizations, his family history, and his membership in historical organizations.  The bulk of the collection consists of Laverty's research files on Irish soldiers in American wars, members of the United Irishmen and the Fenian Brotherhood who emigrated to the United States, and members of religious orders who served as medical personnel on battlefields.  The collection also contains correspondence, clippings, photographs, paper and born-digital administrative documents, publications of Irish historical and republican organizations with which Laverty was associated, and a video recording of members of the Irish Brigade Association.  Laverty's work as a journalist is documented mainly through his publication Automotive Week, a weekly newsletter on the automobile aftermarket.  The collection also includes the papers of William V. Kennedy, an author and historian with an interest in the American Civil War.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Charles Laverty Papers date from 1767 to 2015, with the bulk of the material dating between 1960 and 2010.  The collection documents Laverty's research interests, his working life, his participation in Irish republican organizations, his family history, and his membership in historical organizations.  The bulk of the collection consists of Laverty's research files on Irish soldiers in American wars, members of the United Irishmen and the Fenian Brotherhood who emigrated to the United States, and members of religious orders who served as medical personnel on battlefields.  The research files contain photocopies from 19th and 20th century books, periodicals, and maps, as well as photographs, correspondence, pamphlets, and notes collected and created by Laverty.  He used these files to create a website containing biographies of Irish people who settled in the American colonies and the United States between the 17th century through the 19th century.  Laverty's membership in the Irish Brigade Association and the New York Irish History Roundtable is well documented in this collection through correspondence with members, paper and born-digital business records, clippings and photographs documenting activities of both organizations, and publications of both organizations.  Laverty's work as a journalist is documented mainly through his publication Automotive Week, a weekly newsletter on the automobile aftermarket, with a small amount of material documenting his work at McGraw-Hill in the 1950s.  The collection includes correspondence between Laverty and his family, photographs of his parents and siblings, and clippings about his family's horse breeding business and his brother's soccer career.  Laverty's interest and participation in Irish republican organizations is documented through letters to Laverty from Brian O'Higgins, founding member and president of Sinn FÃ©in; correspondence, publications, and administrative documents from Laverty's participation in Clan na Gael, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, and Irish Prisoners Aid Committee.  The collection also includes the papers of William V. Kennedy, an author and historian with an interest in the American Civil War.  These include articles by Kennedy on the military and Catholicism, his work with the Thompson Battalion Memorial Project Committee, his military career, and his lawsuits brought against the Army War College.</field>
