    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series documents Laverty's almost 60 years of involvement with the Irish Brigade Association (IBA) and his interest in the 69th Regiment of the United States Army.  Material in this series dates from 1861 through 2014, with the bulk of the material dating from the early 2000s.  The material includes correspondence, newsletters, paper and born-digital business and subject files, print photographs, a video recording, and ephemera.  The correspondence documents Laverty's involvement in the organization from its founding in the 1960s through his work as the organization's president in the early 2000s and includes correspondence between Laverty and members of Congress, librarians and archivists, historians, and other members of the IBA.  The subject files document the organization's work to locate the graves of former members of the regiment, through correspondence with research organizations and cemeteries, and paper and born-digital lists compiled by Laverty of confirmed and unconfirmed grave sites in cemeteries in New York and other states.  The business files consist of correspondence and notes regarding meetings and events planned by the IBA.  The video recording contains footage of members of the IBA marching in the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade and the ephemera consists of ribbons from IBA events.  Other topics covered by this series include articles and books written by and about the IBA and members of the regiment, Civil War reenactment events, members of religious orders who served as medical personnel with the regiment, and Laverty's personal interest in particular members of the Regiment, including Thomas Francis Meagher and James McKay Rorty.  In addition to the IBA's newsletter, The Irish Volunteer, this series also includes newsletters published by the the 69th Volunteer Corps, and the Veterans Corps 69th Regiment.</field>
