Material in this series dates from 1767 to 2014, with the bulk of the material dating from the 1990s and 2000s, and includes notes, printouts from online sources and photocopies of primary and secondary sources with some notes, books and pamphlets, photographs, maps, correspondence, writings by Laverty, and 18th and 19th century documents purchased by Laverty.  The bulk of the material consists of photocopies of biographical data from secondary and primary sources, with notations by Laverty, and lists of and notes on reference sources, including book and article titles, names of historical and research institutions, and names of people to contact regarding Laverty's research interests.  Other material in this series includes lists and notes Laverty compiled from his research files to include in a project first conceived of as a five volume encyclopedia to be titled Encyclopedia of Irish-American Military History, and was later hosted on a website titled IrishAmericanIndex.com.
