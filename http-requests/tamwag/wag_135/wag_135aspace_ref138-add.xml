    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains the papers of Presidents Frank Dutto and Harry Lorber and includes two slim folders of the papers of Michael (Mac) Sandroff who served as Business Agent and Editor of the "Local 3 News" from 1955 until his retirement. Unfortunately the absence of many of Dutto's papers in the Collection belies his extensive activities. Of particular interest is an election leaflet from 1947 bearing his picture, and a map with the location of his cemetery plot. The bulk of the material in this series belongs to Lorber. In addition to general files and correspondence related to his activities with Locals 3 and 51, Lorber's papers document his presence at a score of hearings as a member of the International General Executive Board, as well as his involvement with the Baking Industry Labor-Management Apprenticeship Council. He was often called upon as a public speaker and a folder of his speeches can be found in this series.</field>
