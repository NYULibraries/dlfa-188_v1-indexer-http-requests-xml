    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on February 26, 1994 by Dawn Vander Vloed at an unspecified location.  The majority of the interview covers Luba Kadison Buloff's experiences as a Yiddish theatre actor and her acting experiences in Europe and the United States (US).  Buloff recalls growing up in the acting world and traveling throughout Europe to perform for various Jewish communities.  Buloff states that after immigrating to the US, she continued to act, that her entire life was related to theatre, and that she did not socialize outside of the troupe.  Buloff described 2nd Avenue in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York as lively due to the large volume of Yiddish theatres and high attendance of each show.  She explains that by the 1940s, she thought that the Yiddish theatre had become too commercialized, which led her to move to Chicago, Illinois.  Buloff explains that she felt that the New York Yiddish theatre became less about the art of acting and more about profits and fame.</field>
