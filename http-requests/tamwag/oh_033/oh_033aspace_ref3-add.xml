    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on November 17, 1992 by Sushan Chin at Rose Picca DeAngelo's apartment in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  DeAngelo's husband, Sam DeAngelo, participates in the first half of the interview.  The interview covers Rose DeAngelo's family and working life.  DeAngelo discusses her childhood, including the apartments in which her family lived and the fact that her mother had 15 children.  She discusses the death of seven of her siblings as infants, causes of infant mortality in the early 20th century, and the death of her father.  She describes her siblings, their careers, and their families.  DeAngelo and her husband recount their wedding and their 50th and 60th anniversary celebrations.  Sam DeAngelo discusses discipline in school and at home, his working life, and his and Rose's reasons for staying in the LES.  Rose DeAngelo discusses different jobs she had in an unspecified hat factory,  at the American Steel Wool Manufacturing Company factory, as a tomato packer at an unspecified factory, and as a seamstress in an unspecified garment factory in the LES.  She explains that she and her friend were strike breakers in the hat factory and her opinions of labor unions before and after this experience.  She discusses the custom of having midwives attend at home births, her mother's four sets of twins, and their mortality rate.  DeAngelo describes her work as a seamstress at Post Manufacturing Company on Lafayette Street, including the types of athletic clothes she made, the decline of the business, and working conditions in the factory.  She describes the apartments in which she lived in the LES and sections of the neighborhood, including Worth Street and Mulberry Street Park.  Other topics include military service of DeAngelo's family members, crime in the LES in the 1910s and at the time of the interview, Italian residents of the LES, and benefits of her membership in an unspecified labor union (likely the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America).</field>
