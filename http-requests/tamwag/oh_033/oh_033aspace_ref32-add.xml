    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on October 11 and October 16, 1991 by Joseph Glancey, Jr. at an unspecified location.  The interview covers Nora O'Malley's childhood in Ireland, her family, and her experiences as a cook at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  O'Malley can sometimes be hard to hear.  She describes her family and her childhood in Ireland, including her house and chores, her siblings, and her relationship with her parents.  She recalls social and leisure activities in the village near her family's farm and Christmas and birthday traditions.  She discusses the differences in cooking when she first came to the Henry  Street Settlement in the 1930s and later in her career, specifically having machines to assist in peeling and cutting vegetables and frozen foods.  She recounts different apartments in which she lived in the LES before she moved into 267 Henry Street, one of the buildings managed by the Henry Street Settlement, and describes her apartment.  She describes the other cooks with whom she worked, their responsibilities, and types of meals they cooked.  Other topics include Helen Hall and Thanksgiving at the Henry Street Settlement.
