    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on October 11, 1991 by Ulrike Daehnhardt at the Henry Street Settlement's Home Planning Workshop at the Vladeck Houses in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  The interview covers Philip Kiriakos's childhood, family, and experiences as a tenant of the Vladeck Houses.  He describes his daughters and discusses the deaths of his elder daughter in 1983 and his wife in 1988.  He recounts learning about the Vladeck Houses and being one of the first families to move into the apartments.  He discusses the differences between life in the tenements and Vladeck Houses, including having bathrooms inside the apartment and having rent determined by the occupants' salaries.  He discusses crime in the Vladeck Houses and other housing projects at the time of the interview and his opinion that the Vladeck Houses are better than other housing projects.  He discusses his neighbors and his decision to stay in the Vladeck Houses because of his relationship with one family.  He recounts life in the tenements in the 1910s and 1920s, including Christmas and New Year's traditions, trolleys in front of the buildings, and ways to keep cool in the summer.  Other topics include his participation in a theatre group at the Church of St. James in Manhattan and different jobs he held.</field>
