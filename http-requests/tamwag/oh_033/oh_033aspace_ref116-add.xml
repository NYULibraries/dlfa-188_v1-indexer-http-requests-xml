    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on October 20, 1995 by Sarah Schatz at Karl Akiya's residence in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Akiya discusses the experience of being Japanese American, his education in Japan, his career, and his participation in civil rights movements in the United States (US). Akiya describes the discrimination experienced by Japanese people in the US, including anti-immigration laws and concentration camps during World War II. He discusses his experience as one of the kibei, Japanese Americans who left the US for schooling in Japan.  He discusses traveling to Washington, DC in order to get a job with the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Akiya describes moving to New York City and working at a Japanese bank where he observed discriminatory hiring practices against Black and Latino people. Akiya describes working as a finisher in a furniture factory and becoming a union representative (likely in the United Furniture Workers of America). Akiya discusses his involvement in both civil rights and anti-nuclear movements; he discusses trying and failing to see Malcolm X on the day he was murdered and going to anti-apartheid meetings in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. He describes receiving the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Community Organizing.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Karl Akiya was born in San Francisco, California in 1909. His father was a chef from Yokohama, Japan who immigrated to the United States (US) in order to learn how to cook American food. Akiya's mother immigrated to the US from Japan after her marriage was arranged with Akiya's father. Akiya was the oldest of three children, and had one brother and one sister. His parents sent Akiya and his siblings to Japan for their education in 1915. Akiya returned to the US in 1932, giving up his dual Japanese citizenship, in order to escape being drafted into the Japanese Army. During World War II he was incarcerated at the Topaz War Relocation Camp in Utah. Akiya worked at two banks, the Office of Strategic Services, a furniture store, and at the University of Michigan as a Japanese teacher. In 1987, Akiya received the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award for Community Organizing.</field>
