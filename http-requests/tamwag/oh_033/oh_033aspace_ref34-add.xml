    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on November 30, 1991 by John S. Berman at Rose Singer's apartment in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  The interview covers Singer's experiences in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and at the Henry Street Settlement in the LES, particularly as a member of the Alcott Club.  Singer describes the Vladeck Houses in the LES and recounts moving there in 1940.  She discusses her membership in the Alcott Club at the Henry Street Settlement, her participation in other events and activities at the Settlement, and her friends at the Settlement.  She explains that she developed confidence through these activities at the Settlement.  She discusses her early life in the LES, her unhappiness at moving to the neighborhood as a teenager after the death of her father, and compares the LES with Yonkers in the 1920s and 1930s.  She recounts her early working life in the early 1930s as a children's clothing inspector and the working conditions in the factory in which she worked.  She discusses her parents and the ways in which her mother supported the family after her husband's death in 1927.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Singer discusses her involvement in the Henry Street Settlement in the LES and recounts her first memories of the Settlement in the 1930s.  She discusses the settlement houses' social programs and the ways in which they benefited the LES.  She discusses the sense of community she felt at the Henry Street Settlement and the freedom she felt being away from her young children and her husband for a short time.  She explains that her husband at first resented her involvement with the Settlement, his resentment at having to care for their children while she went out, and her resentment of his leisure activities and the double-standard that existed in their family.  She describes holiday activities at the Settlement, in particular the fact that the different ethnic and religious groups at the Settlement would work together to create inclusive events before Irish and Italian members formed separate groups based on ethnic identities.  She describes the Settlement programs in which the Alcott Club took a particular interest, including working for better housing in the LES, a cooperative milk program, and clothing swaps.  Other topics include her memories of the Great Depression, discussion of her husband's working life, and her memories of Helen Hall.</field>
