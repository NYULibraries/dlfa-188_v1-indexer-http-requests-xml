He recounts his first experiences in the LES and compares the LES and Williamsburg neighborhoods in the 1950s.  He discusses studying the violin at the Music School with Louise Behrend, recalls his memories of his first days at the school, and describes the building in which the school was housed on Pitt Street in the LES.  He describes Behrend and her philosophy of teaching violin.
