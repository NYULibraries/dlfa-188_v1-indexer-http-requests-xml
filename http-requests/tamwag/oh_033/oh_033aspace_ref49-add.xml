The interview covers Fox's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and his family.  Fox describes his family's apartment in the LES and their neighbors.  He recalls a beer hall near their apartment and songs the customers would sing.  He discusses traditions in his family surrounding Jewish holidays, in particular Passover and Hanukah.  He discusses his relationship with his mother, including her cooking and her insistence on home remedies and medication used by their Italian neighbors.  He discusses events in the LES during election time, including bonfires and candidates' speeches.  He discusses his sisters having to work in the family's store and their resentment at the fact that he did not have to work in the store.  He recalls attending Hebrew school and participating in events and activities at the Boys' Club, the Victor Athletic Club, and the Christodora House, all located in the LES.  He describes street games he and his friends would play and recounts going to the Peter Jarema Funeral Home in the LES with his friends in order to view the bodies.</field>
