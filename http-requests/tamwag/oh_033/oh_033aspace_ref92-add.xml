    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on March 6, 1994 by Dawn Vander Vloed at an unspecified location. Ida Fier describes her childhood and adolescence in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. She describes witnessing her father's death of a heart attack and her embarrassment at her mother's subsequent decision to become the janitor at their 232 Rivington Street apartment. Fier discusses her relationship with her mother, in particular her support of Fier's desire to attend college and their conflict over Orthodox Judaism. She describes feeling unable to discuss abortion and menstruation with her mother. Fier describes the importance of local institutions such as the Henry Street Settlement and the local library for entertainment and education. She describes doing schoolwork at the public library when there were guests at home, going to school during the summer to learn basket and rug weaving, and taking piano lessons at the Henry Street Settlement. She discusses the limited enforcement of quarantines in the LES. Fier discusses joining the Communist Party of the United States of America in college and being a student teacher at Seward Park High School. Fier discusses the impact of nostalgia on accounts of the LES by her generation, arguing that people are sentimental about their youths because their lives had more potential.</field>
