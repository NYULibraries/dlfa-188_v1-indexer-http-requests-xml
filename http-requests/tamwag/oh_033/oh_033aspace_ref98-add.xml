    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on February 22, 1994 by Lori Finkelstein at Mendel Weiss's store at 91 Orchard Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  The majority of the interview covers Weiss's immigration experience, his experience owning a business, and his opinions on differences in the Lower East Side between the1960s and the time of the interview.  Weiss discusses the difficulties he faced getting his immigration papers.  He remembers having to travel around Russia for the required documents and physical examination.  Weiss recalls purchasing the space that became his wholesale and retail business.  He states that the ethnic demographics of the neighborhood had changed from predominantly Jewish and Eastern European in the 1960s to Chinese and Hispanic at the time of the interview.  Weiss shares his opinion that the growth of department stores in the Lower East Side has increased at the time of the interview and was hurting local businesses.</field>
