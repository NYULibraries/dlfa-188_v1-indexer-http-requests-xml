    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on October 4 and December 8, 1995 by Ellen Noonan at Julius Manson's apartment in the Stuyvesant Town residential complex in  Manhattan, New York.  The majority of the interview covers Manson's childhood in the Harlem and Lower East Side (LES) neighborhoods of Manhattan and his experience at the Three Arrows Cooperative Society (3A)  in Putnam Valley, New York.  Manson recalls playing in the street in the LES, in particular running underneath horses.  He describes the poverty of his family and their neighbors.  Manson explains various political and socialist philosophies, and discusses his memberships to the Young People's Socialist League, the War Resisters' League, 3A, and the Hebrew Free Loan Society.  He goes into detail about his financial struggles as a young adult and how he borrowed money from the Hebrew Free Loan Society who offered interest-free loans to its members.  He discusses in detail the fundamentals of the Hebrew Free Loan Society and the types of loans services they provided for its members.  Manson explains that he joined 3A because it required its members to accept cooperative living principles, like common ownership of property, and overall community involvement.  He describes giving public speeches to the 3A community as well as to neighborhoods in Manhattan.</field>
