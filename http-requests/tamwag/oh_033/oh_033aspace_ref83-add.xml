    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on June 3, 1993 by Sylvia Groen at an unspecified location.  The majority of the interview covers Beverly Fischer Weinstein's childhood experiences being raised by her widowed mother in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She vividly describes the family's apartment on Madison Street in the LES apartment and the fact that it was an entire floor of the building and a railroad style apartment.  Weinstein discusses the fact that their apartment was near her family's leather business.  She discusses her friends' reactions to her apartment and to the LES and their comparisons between the LES and  the neighborhoods in which they lived in upper Manhattan.  Weinstein recalls visiting the Educational Alliance and being a member of the Young Israel Synagogue of Manhattan.  She discusses the importance of family; weekly Sunday visits from relatives who lived in Newark, New Jersey; and her participation in many weddings.  She expresses pride in her education and work experiences and explains that she was glad she waited until she was about 30 years old to get married.  Weinstein states that she enjoyed her independence and argued that it allowed her to gain meaningful experiences which she might not have been able to have if she had gotten married and started a family at an earlier age.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Beverly Fischer Weinstein was born into a Jewish family in 1935 in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Her parents immigrated to the United States (US) from Poland in the early 1900s.  Her maternal grandfather was the schochet, or ritual slaughterer, for the Jewish community of Newark, New Jersey.  In 1923, Weinstein's parents married and moved to the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Her father managed a wholesale leather business in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan.  After the birth of her eldest brother, the family moved to an apartment on Henry Street in the LES.  After the death of her father when Weinstein was two years old, her mother managed the business and raised her five children.  Between 1937 and 1955, the family lived in a three bedroom apartment on Madison Street in the LES.  She earned her bachelor's degree in sociology and psychology from City College in Manhattan.  Weinstein worked as a psychiatrist at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens.  During her 20s, Weinstein travelled and worked in Israel for a few years, before returning to the US and working at Columbia-Presbyterian Clinic located in Upper Manhattan.  She married in 1964 and had children.  The family moved to the Fresh Meadows neighborhood of Queens, where she lived at the time of the interview.</field>
