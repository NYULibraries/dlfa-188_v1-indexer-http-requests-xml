    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on October 15, 1991 by Timothy W. Allison at Phebe Thorne Marrin's apartment in Manhattan, New York.  The interview covers Marrin's experiences as a member of the Board of Directors at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her working life.  Marrin discusses the beginning of her involvement with the Henry Street Settlement as a volunteer in the Drama Department and Pete's House Productions working with Joseph Balfior.  She discusses ethnic and racial tensions in the LES and the ways in which the staff of the Drama Department sought to teach the children and teenagers how to resolve them.  She recounts her idea to coordinate the drama, dance, and music programs as a unified arts program at the Settlement and the fact that this led to her invitation to join the Board of Directors in 1966.  She explains that she became involved in fundraising activities, continued with her drama classes, and worked as a nurse until she had children and no longer had time to dedicate to volunteering.  She recounts her decisions to leave her nursing position in 1973, to become a lobbyist in Albany for a state senator for ten years, and to enroll in law school at Pace University in Manhattan.  She discusses the creation of the Settlement's Art Show between 1987 and 1989 and her idea to have it at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan.  She describes Jimmy Robinson, the head of the Youth Program, and his Cavaliers program, and the leader of the Youth Program at the time of the interview.  Other topics include the creation of the Settlement's Urban Family Center and Arts Center, her experiences as a lobbyist, and the Friends of Henry Street.</field>
