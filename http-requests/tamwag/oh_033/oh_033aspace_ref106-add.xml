    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on February 27, 1993 by Christine Halvorson at Nellie Dick's house in Oyster Bay, New York.  The interview is primarily with Nellie Dick and her son, Jim Dick, occasionally participates.  The majority of the interview covers Nellie Dick's recollections of anarchist communities in London, England; New York; and New Jersey.   Dick recalls attending a lecture given by Johann Rudolf Rocker in London when she was eight or nine years old and being the only child present at the lecture.  She explains that her immersion into politics at a young age resulted in her dedicated involvement in the anarchist community.  Dick goes into detail about what she considers to be the fundamental differences between anarchists and Communists, one being the belief that there should be a bit of a hierarchy to the working and social structure of a community.  She describes teaching herself to read Yiddish and her eagerness to learn.  Dick recalls working closely with her fellow principals at the Modern School to write the Voice of the Children, a Stelton Colony publication.  As leaders of the Ferrer Colony, Nellie and her husband each proposed and carried out projects to better the community, including better living conditions for the boarding school students and improvements to school buildings.  She explains that not only did the students attend classes at the school, they were also responsible for maintaining the grounds of the school.  Dick describes teaching her students manners as she strongly believed in etiquette and discipline.  Dick expresses her adoration for the Stelton Colony and her pride as a contributing leader of that community, as she was a proponent of always improving the community.  She also explains the colony's mission, which expresses the importance of responsibility in order to have freedom, and the living atmosphere of the Ferrer Colony.  Dick explains that she knew she belonged within the Ferrer Colony because she shared the outstanding belief that there should be a change in government and that all individuals should receive an education.</field>
