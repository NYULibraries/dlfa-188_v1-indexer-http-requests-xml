Her parents met after emigrating from Japan; her father attended the University of California, Berkeley, and her mother traveled to California after the end of her first marriage. Iijima's father started a Japanese-language newspaper in which her mother published poetry. Iijima attended the University of California, Berkeley. During World War II, she was first forcibly removed to the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Bruno, California and then incarcerated at the Topaz War Relocation Center near Delta, Utah. She married Tak Iijima, in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team at Camp Shelby in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.
