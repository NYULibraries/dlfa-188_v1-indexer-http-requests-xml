Throughout the interview, Kalawsky describes her family's apartments in the LES, living arrangements in the apartments, appliances in the apartments, the ways in which the family members negotiated privacy for themselves in the apartment.  She discusses her parents' responsibilities as the janitors in the buildings in which they lived.   She discusses her mother, her jobs outside of the home, and her feelings about working outside of the home, in particular her enjoyment of discussing politics with her coworkers.  She discusses her father's work for the City of New York as a watchman on construction sites.  She discusses her parents' relationship and their immigration experiences.  She discusses her Irish neighbors, a Catholic church in her neighborhood to which she wanted to belong, and the fact that she wanted to be Irish rather than Russian.  Kalawsky discusses the death of her oldest sister from spinal meningitis when she was seven years old and her mother's feelings about illness in the family after the death of her daughter.  She discusses her relationship with her parents, the fact that her mother worried over her safety and the games and skills her father taught her.  She recalls her memories of the different ethnic groups that lived together in the LES, in particular the foods of each group and her opinion that the diversity was beneficial to the people living in the neighborhood.
