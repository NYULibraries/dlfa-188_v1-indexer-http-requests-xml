    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Greg Raynor on November 14, 1991 at Bertram Beck's office at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York.  The interview covers Beck's experiences as the Director of the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and as Executive Director at the Mobilization for Youth in the LES.  Beck discusses his education and his family, including his work in the Merchant Marine before entering college and his parents' involvement with the Henry Street Settlement.  He discusses his cooperative jobs while a student at Antioch College in Ohio and the fact that these led to his interest in social work.  He describes the youth development programs at the Settlement and recounts the creation and mission of Mobilization for Youth.  He discusses Helen Hall, her philosophy of social work, and her involvement in the creation of Mobilization for Youth.  He recounts a strike by Settlement staff in 1965 and the division this led to between the Settlement, Mobilization for Youth, and other organizations in the LES.   He describes the differing approaches to social work between the Settlement and Mobilization for Youth and the communities each served.  He recounts becoming the Director at the Settlement and issues he faced directing both the Settlement and Mobilization for Youth.  He compares his relationship with Helen Hall with her relationship with Lillian Wald.  Other topics include Beck's experiences on an unspecified New York City school board and ethnic and racial tensions in the LES.
