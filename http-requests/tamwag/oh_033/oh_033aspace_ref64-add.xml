He describes his family's apartment in the LES, the layout, and the amenities and utilities in the apartment.  He recalls home remedies his mother would use, his opinion of doctors, and he and his brother being quarantined for diphtheria.  He describes his father's work as a carpenter, his carpentry business, and his customers.  He discusses the schools he attended.  He describes the ethnic boundaries in the LES, the fact that he and his friends were careful of staying in the Jewish sections of the neighborhood, and animosities between Jewish, Italian, Russian, and Polish residents of the LES.  He recounts his relationship with his father and the differences between parenting in the 1920s and 1930s and at the time of the interview, in particular the importance placed on fathers spending time with their sons in 1990s.  He describes his work as an electrician with his brother after his graduation from high school and after his discharge from the Navy after World War II.  He discusses his career as a sales manager for a brick company.
