    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on October 27, 1995 by Liz Renner at Norman Eddy's home in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  The interview covers Eddy's early life in Connecticut, his experiences during World War II, and his experiences in East Harlem as a Protestant minister.  Eddy describes New Britain, Connecticut and discusses the relationship between the Yankee residents and the immigrants who settled in New Britain in the early 20th century.  He describes his grandparents, their personalities, and their influences on him.  He describes his experiences during World War II (WWII) and recounts his duties a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Field Service in northern Africa and the Middle East.  He compares the experiences of soldiers during WWII and those who served in the Vietnam War, and the impressions he had of how American civilians perceived the experiences of soldiers and civilians living in countries affected by the war.  He explains that after his service in the war, he decided to take time to decide what career he wanted for himself.  He recounts his experiences between 1944 and 1948, traveling throughout the United States, working on farms, and learning about different religions.  He describes a spiritual experience he had during WWII in Syria, and his interest in Buddhism, Islam, and mystical parts of Judaism.  He explains how this experience inspired him to serve the spiritual needs of people and his belief at the time that this would not be possible in established Protestant churches.  He recounts taking courses at the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan in 1945.  He discusses his work as a farm laborer in different areas of the United States between 1945 and 1948 and studying in New York City during the winters.  He recounts enrolling full time at the Seminary, working in East Harlem, and joining the East Harlem Protestant Parish and moving to East Harlem in 1949.  He describes the sense of community he witnessed in East Harlem amongst the Puerto Rican, African American, Eastern European, and Italian residents of the neighborhood.  He explains that while everyone was aware of the ways in which their neighbors were different from them, they were connected by the fact that they were neighbors and lived together.  He discusses the work of the Metro North Citizens' Committee and the Parish to ensure the residents of the neighborhood had adequate housing.  He discusses the ways in which public housing projects positively and negatively affected the community and compares them to the tenements they replaced.</field>
