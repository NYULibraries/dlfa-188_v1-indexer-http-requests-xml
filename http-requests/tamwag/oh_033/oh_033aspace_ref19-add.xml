    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on November 3, 1991 by Renee Newman at Martin Canin's apartment in Manhattan, New York.  The interview covers Canin's family and experiences at the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  Canin recounts his introduction to the piano and the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement.  He discusses his teachers at the Henry Street Settlement, Aurelio Giorni and Robert Scholz, and elaborates on his relationship with Scholz.  He discusses his family, including the instruments each member played and his relationship with his brother, Stuart Canin.  He discusses Rosemary Younker; her patronage of the Music School; her sponsorship of him, which allowed for his attendance at the Meadowmount School of Music in Lewis, New York; and his relationship with her son, Herman.  Other topics include his experiences as a student at the Juilliard School in Manhattan and in the United States Army Band during the Korean War.  For more interviews about the Music School at the Henry Street Settlement see Baron, Samuel; Behrend, Louise; and Herman, David.</field>
