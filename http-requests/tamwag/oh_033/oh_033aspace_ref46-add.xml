The interview covers Eisner's early life in the Lower East Side (LES) neighborhood of Manhattan and her family.  Eisner describes the apartments in which her family lived in the LES, in particular their apartment on Goerck Street.  She discusses her family's traditions around the Jewish sabbath, including having a non-Jewish person conduct chores for them during the sabbath and the foods her family would eat.  She recounts using public bathhouses and discusses the family's neighbors and neighborhood traditions surrounding Jewish holidays and funerals.  She discusses her education, including attending the Downtown Talmud Torah in the LES and Washington Irving High School in Manhattan.  She discusses her family, including her parents' relationship with her mother's widowed sister and the fact that her husband did not want her to work outside of the home.
