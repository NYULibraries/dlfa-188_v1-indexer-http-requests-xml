    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the correspondence (1982-1990) is from fellow veterans of the Spanish Civil War, and is related to Iceland's tenure as editor of the Volunteer. Many letters expand on controversies within VALB, or comment on articles and reviews published in the Volunteer.  Subjects include contemporary issues such as the war in Nicaragua and proliferation of nuclear arms; the selection of material for the anthology, Our Fight, edited by Alvah Bessie and Albert Prago; as well as subjects related to the Spanish Civil War. Communism and Socialism were perennial sources of debate. Many letters include reminiscences of the war in Spain.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence includes letters from more than fifty different persons; Victor Berch, Alvah Bessie, Irving Weissman and Milton Wolff are among the more prolific correspondents. A 1990 letter from Carl Geiser provides a lengthy description of his trip to Cuba. Notable, too, is the correspondence from Wilhelm "Willi" Schutt, a 1929 German immigrant to New York City who fought with the Lincoln Battalion in Spain.  Schutt, denied entry to the United States after the Spanish Civil War, lived in England during World War II.  After the war he moved to East Germany where he lived until his death.</field>
