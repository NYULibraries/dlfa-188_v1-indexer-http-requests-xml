    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The United Women Firefighters Records (dates 1957-2022, bulk 1979-1993) document the career of firefighter Brenda Berkman and the founding and operation of the United Women Firefighters. The collection consists of scrapbooks, personal correspondence, legal documents, organizational files, subject files, clippings, memorabilia, photographs, and videos. A large portion of the collection documents the life and career of founder Brenda Berkman, the successful legal actions Berkman brought against the City of New York and the New York City Fire Department (Berkman v. the City of New York; Berkman v. NYCFD) between 1977 and 1993, and the unsuccessful appeal by the City of New York to Judge Charles Sifton's 1982 ruling that the City had discriminated against women through its physical exam. Materials related more directly to Berkman's career include scrapbooks of her personal achievements; clippings, videos, and ephemera documenting her advocacy for women in male-dominated professions; recruitment correspondence; and condolences sent to Berkman following the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks. Also featured are audio visual and born-digital materials of presentations, news segments, interviews, photographs, and speeches by Brenda Berkman on behalf of the United Women Firefighters.  The collection also documents the founding and operation of the United Women Firefighters, and the related national support group, Women in Fire Service. These organizational files largely consist of newspapers clippings, correspondence, and FDNY recruitment and sexual-harassment training documents.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Women Firefighters (UWF) was founded in 1982 by the first group of New York City women firefighters to address occupational and sexual discrimination in the New York City Fire Department (NYCFD, also known as the FDNY by the department). Modeled on groups like the Vulcan Society (representing African-American firefighters), the UWF assists women firefighters who have encountered a wide range of problems on the job, from ill-fitting equipment to unjust probation and sexual assault. They have lobbied for training for all officers and firefighters on issues related to women on the job. Representatives of the organization have developed ties with other women firefighters' organizations, including the national coalition, Women in Fire Service. The United Women Firefighters publishes a monthly newsletter, the Voice Alarm.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The FDNY began accepting applications from women for the position of firefighter in 1977, but did not hire any women until after Brenda Berkman successfully sued the City of New York on behalf of herself and other women who had passed the written examination. Berkman, a law student at New York University at the time of her application, sued the City under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, questioning the validity of the physical exam. In 1982, Judge Charles Sifton ruled that the City had indeed discriminated against women through its physical exam, known as the 3040 exam, which included tests that were biased against women and unrelated to a firefighter's future performance on the job. The suit and Sifton's ruling sparked controversy in the Fire Department and the media. Litigation related to this original ruling continued until 1988. Berkman, who was a founding member and president of the United Women Firefighters, filed an additional lawsuit against the FDNY in 1992 challenging incidents of sexual harassment directed at women in the department.</field>
