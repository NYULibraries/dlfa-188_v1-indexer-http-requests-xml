    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Contains material gathered or created by Andrews in preparation for creating cartoons or other artwork. This includes clippings of newspapers (often annotated by Andrews), his notes on news items and sketches in pencil. Also included are idea files, which contain a combination of clippings, notes and sketches on particular themes or topics. A small number of sketchbooks and two rolls of sketches are also part of this series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Most of the material in this series was collected or created while Andrews was employed by the Daily World. As a result, many of the clippings, sketches and notes respond to current events, including the Vietnam War, the Attica Prison riots, and the activities of President Richard M. Nixon, including his resignation.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A small amount of material was also created by Andrews when he worked for Arizona State University. These sketches are for promotional brochures, fliers and posters.</field>
