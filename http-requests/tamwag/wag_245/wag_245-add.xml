    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Evelyn Davis Papers and Photographs consists of Evelyn Davis's personal papers and memorabilia.  Her extant papers reflect a life-long interest in the history of African-Americans in theater and film. The bulk of the collection is made up of scripts, playbills, and contract agreements from Davis's appearances in plays and television programs throughout the 1940s, '50s, and '60s. There are also papers from organizations to which Davis belonged, including a membership card from the Screen Actors Guild, a membership certificate from the Negro Actors Guild of America, and contracts from the Actors' Equity Association. The collection also contains letters, cards,and telegrams from family and friends, including actors with whom Davis worked. Illuminating Davis's interests are several collections of Negro spirituals, an essay on racial prejudice by Dr. Juan Rene Betancourt, an issue of Theater Arts entitled "The Negro in the American Theater," and a booklet, "The Way It Was," that commemorates African-American actors and actresses.  The collection also includes two photograph albums that have been disassembled and one intact photograph album (largely black and white prints for all three), one disassembled scrapbook, and ninety loose black and white photographs ranging in size from 11x14 to 2x3 inches.  Included in the photographs are signed headshots from other actors and actresses and stills of theater performances.</field>
