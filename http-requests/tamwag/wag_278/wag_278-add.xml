    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dave Newman was a frame worker for the New York Telephone Company and a member of Communications Workers of America (CWA), Local 1101.  His clash with the CWA leadership, and especially the administration of local president Ricky Carnivale led to a major legal struggle.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1975, Newman was elected as a CWA, Local 1101 steward by the workers at 104 Broad Street.  Following his criticism of the CWA leadership in his regular column for the rank-and-file publication Broad Street News, he was removed from office by the Local Executive Board in December 1976.  A protracted legal battle ensued, and Newman was eventually reinstated, on free speech grounds, by a court order in 1979.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Newman later ran for election as business agent for the Southern Division of CWA Local 1101, and although his campaign was unsuccessful, he was able to mobilize a rank and file movement within the Local.</field>
