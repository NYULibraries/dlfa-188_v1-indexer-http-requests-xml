    <field name="bioghist_teim">Miriam "Mimi" Dale Pichey was a member of the Socialist Workers Party. She grew up in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Community Party sympathizers. She attended her first demonstration in 1960, an anti-nuclear war rally sponsored by Women for Peace. Through the 1960s she was active in the civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam War effort. After brief encounters with SOEAL (Students Organized Education and Action League), a high school group affiliated with the DuBois Clubs in San Francisco in 1965, and SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) in 1968-1969 at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, Pichey joined the Young Socialist Alliance in 1969 and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in 1973. In January 1980, Pichey traveled to Cuba on a fact-finding trip. She recounted these experiences and shared slides at Cuba Today: An Eyewitness Report in Saint Paul, Minnesota on February 24, 1980. She also travelled to Nicaragua, Grenada, and the Soviet Union. She left the SWP in 1984.</field>
