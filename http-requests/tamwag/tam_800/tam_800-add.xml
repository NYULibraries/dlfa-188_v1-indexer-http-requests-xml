    <field name="abstract_teim">VietnameseBoatPeople.org is comprised of a team of volunteers, contributors, and students who dedicate their labor and time to recording the narratives of refugees of the Vietnam War. The recordings in this collection take the form of a podcast, Vietnamese Boat People, which is accessible both through the organization's website and on various podcasting platforms. Tracey Nguyen Mang, born Nguyen Quan Truong-Anh, founded the project as a means to honor and preserve both her family's and her own stories of fleeing Vietnam by boat, living in refugee camps, surviving familial separation, and being reunited in the United States. The Vietnamese Boat People Podcast Records (dated 2020-2021) consists of materials documenting the creation and production of the Vietnamese Boat People podcast, including electronic audio files, transcripts, and supplemental photographs. Each podcast episode is documented through an edited audio version with soundbed music, an edited audio version without soundbed, raw interview files, English-language transcripts, and digitized photographs. The collection documents narratives of refugees of the Vietnam War, as well as an effort on the part of the podcast team to "preserve and carry forward the stories of this generation so that younger Vietnamese-Americans can understand and be inspired by their heritage."</field>

According to their website, "The Vietnamese Boat People podcast project is to preserve and carry forward the stories of this generation so that younger Vietnamese-Americans can understand and be inspired by their heritage. And if these stories evoke  others outside of this community to have more empathy towards the millions of refugees around the  world today, then this project has accomplished more than we had hoped for." </field>
