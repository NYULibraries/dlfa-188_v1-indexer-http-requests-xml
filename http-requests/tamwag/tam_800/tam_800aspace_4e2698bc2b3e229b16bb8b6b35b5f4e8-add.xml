He has directed, produced, and shot a number of short films, which have played internationally in festivals and museums. His feature documentary directorial debut Live from New York opened the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival. His latest film is Be Water, a documentary about Bruce Lee, airing on ESPN on June 7, 2020. Bao is a child of refugees and grew up working in his parents' fabric shop. From childhood to high school, Bao was a studious student. He was on his way to becoming a lawyer until one day, in a split second decision, he decided to chase after his passion for visual arts. Bao talks about his parents' experiences as "boat people" and what it was like putting his personal life in front of the camera for the first time in his 2019 documentary short Where are You Really From.</field>
