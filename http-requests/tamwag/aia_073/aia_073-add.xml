    <field name="abstract_teim">The Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) was a grassroots organization established in 1987 whose primary objective was to legalize the status of undocumented immigrations from Ireland and 34 other countries adversely affected by America's 1965 Immigration Act. This collection documents the activities of the organization's Boston branch, which combined traditional grassroots activism with legislative lobbying to provide assistance to immigrants in the greater Boston area, leverage Irish American political influence, help shape U.S. immigration policy in the late 1980s, and energize the Irish American political presence in Washington. This collection consists of publications, artifacts, photographs, memoranda, correspondence, research files, congressional transcripts, newspaper clippings, and video footage collected by Gregory Glynn during the course of his involvement with the Boston, Massachusetts chapter of the IIRM. The bulk of the materials date between 1986 and 1989, and document the organization's advocacy and assistance efforts on behalf of Irish immigrants living in the greater Boston area, with an emphasis on providing assistance to immigrants on day-to-day concerns such a housing and employment. The collection also illustrates the organization's lobbying efforts, at both the local and national level, to introduce legislation and other federal policies to increase visa availability, change the immigration quota system, and provide more straightforward paths to legalization.</field>

These efforts were often carried out in collaboration with other agencies and organizations in the area, including advocacy groups focused on different immigrant communities.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) was a grassroots organization established in 1987 whose primary objective was to legalize the status of undocumented immigrations from Ireland and 34 other countries adversely affected by America's 1965 Immigration Act. The IIRM ceased activities in 1992. The creator of this collection, Gregory Glynn, was a publicity officer and one of the founding members of the organization's Boston branch.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Working for legislative reform, the IIRM grew from a small New York-based group to a national organization with branches in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Houston, Washington, Kansas City, San Francisco, and San Jose. The organization's Boston branch, dedicated to the needs of undocumented Irish immigrants in the Massachusetts area, was founded on August 26, 1987 and was located in Dorchester. Combining traditional grassroots activism with legislative lobbying, the IIRM leveraged Irish American political influence to influence U.S. immigration policy in the late 1980s and in the process energized the Irish American political presence in Washington.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Immigration Act of 1990 (H.R. 4300) stands as the primary legislative legacy of the IIRM. This legislation provided a three-year transitional visa program through which 48,000 visas were granted to Ireland, as well as the annual diversity visa lottery program which continued into the 21st century.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Reflecting the IIRM's "all-Ireland" perspective, the transitional visa program contained a provision defining Northern Ireland as a separate state. This unique element, secured through intense lobbying by the IIRM, enabled thousands from Northern Ireland to participate in the visa lottery who, prior to this, had been ineligible because the United States' immigration system classified them as English.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The IIRM was also instrumental in securing 25,000 visas for Ireland through several extensions of the Donnelly Visa program from 1988 up to the implementation of the Immigration Act of 1990.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In order to address the day-to-day problems of documented as well as undocumented Irish at the time, IIRM members established the Emerald Isle Immigration Center (EIIC), which since 1988 has served as a model for similar advice and advocacy agencies in the United States. It operated New York City offices in Woodside, Queens and in Woodlawn, the Bronx.</field>
