It was formed in 1981 during the Writers' Congress held in New York City. In 1981, the NWU affiliated with the United Auto Workers (UAW) as Local 1981. Capture of the website began in 2009. In the early period of the website (2009-2012), the NWU highlighted their work to protect copyright for writers in digital publications, freedom of expression for writers, economic rights, protect against media consolidation, health and safety for writers, and solidarity with other unions.
