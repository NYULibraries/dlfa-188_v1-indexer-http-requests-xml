    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Council of School Supervisors and Administrators is the collective bargaining unit for 6,100 Principals, Assistant Principals, Supervisors and Education Administrators who work in the NYC public schools and 200 Directors and Assistant Directors who work in city- subsidized Centers for Early Childhood Education. CSA was formed from many professional organizations that represented supervisors and administrators as the Council of Supervisory Associations in 1962 to fight for collective bargaining rights with the then NYC Board of Education. In 1968, CSA became a labor union and changed its name to the Council of Supervisors and Administrators. CSA is Local 1 of the American Federation of School Administrators, AFL-CIO, located in Washington, DC. CSA is also affiliated with the NYS Federation of School Administrators, which is, in turn, a member of the NYS School Administrators Consortium. The website contains its newsletter, CSA News, information on workshops and training, political action campaigns, agreements and contracts, and additional photographs and videos.</field>
