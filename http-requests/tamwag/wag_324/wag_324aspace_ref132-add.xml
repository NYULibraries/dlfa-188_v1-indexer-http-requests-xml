    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Founded in 1992, the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance (APALA) was created to address the continued under-representation of Asian Pacific American (APA) workers in the labor movement and the specific challenges APA workers face. APALA works on projects related to voter registration, the DREAM Act, and workplace organizing. Incomplete captures of the website began in 2007 with information on the Employee Free Choice Act, the DREAM Act, voter mobilization efforts, biannual conventions, the Asian Pacific American Workers' Rights Hearing, and the Organizing Institute. The first complete capture of the website occurred in 2014. Then, the website focused on fundraising for victims of Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan); Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA); citizenship rally; mentorship programs; spokesperson training; summits for young leaders and seniors and retirees; congressional voter guides; end of year reports; and other organizing and leadership trainings. In 2015, the website redesigned. The website contained information on stopping the Trans-Pacific Partnership; the All Students Count Act; educational material on immigration, worker rights, and civil rights issues that impact Asian Pacific Americans; labor and community partnerships; and chapter news pages. In 2017, the website redesigned again, with sections on civil and political engagement; organizing and leadership development; racial justice and ending mass criminalization; solidarity with global Asian and Pacific Islander communities; and corporate accountability. Other issues the organization focused on immigration and refugee policies, family immigration, undocumented workers, the census and civic engagement, Black Lives Matter protest and anti-racism resources, anti-asian violence resoueces, and their COVID-19 response and fund for Asian American and Pacific Islanders workers in healthcare, transportation and service industries.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The websites also contain information on activities and policies at the organization's national level as well as for their Washington, DC chapter.  The websites contain infomation on their executive board, youth leadership and organizing committees, press releases, news listings, convention highlights, and a blog.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The YouTube Channel for the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance contains videos of convention panels, awards, speeches, principles for liberation, COVID-19 stories, and APALA's 25th anniversary.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">https://www.apalanet.org/ and https://www.apalaconvention.org/ were rescoped to include the domains drive.google.com, docs.google.com, apalanet.z2systems.com, and d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net to capture the contents of the website.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">In 2023, YouTube URLs were changed to better capture the videos on the channel.</field>
