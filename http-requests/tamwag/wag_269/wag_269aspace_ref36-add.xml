    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: General Files, 1945-2007.  This series contains files documenting activity of the union itself (including conventions, bargaining, correspondence of officers and staff, district chairmen, Hotline messages and elections), as well as topical files.  Well represented are materials on the CSA's relations with the NYC Board of Education and the Chancellor's Office, with the Association of Assistant Principals, the New York City Elementary School Principals Association, and other organizations.  Other files document issues of special interest to the union, for example, ethnicity and bilingual education, the role of parents, performance reviews, pertinent legislation and layoffs and excessing occasioned by the City's fiscal crisis of the 1970s.  A particularly extensive and rich series of files documents the bitter disputes regarding community control of schools (especially in Ocean Hill-Brownsville) that resulted in the teachers' strike of 1968-69.  The CSA took shape in response to these events, and its files and scrapbooks present a minutely detailed account of events, including clippings from the local press, United federation of teachers materials, and rare flyers and ephemera illustrating the role of supervisors and administrators in the conflict.</field>
