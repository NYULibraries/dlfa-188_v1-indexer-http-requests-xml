    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of photographic prints, transparencies, photo negatives, and photographic slides used to produce the Irish Echo, but is not limited to images published in the newspaper.  The majority of the images in the collection were submitted by the Irish Echo staff and contract photographers, although some photographs were sent to the paper by unsolicited individuals. Photographers for the Irish Echo featured in this collection include John Bourke, Peter Dolan, Kevin Kennedy, Tom Matthews, and Michael O'Rourke.  Also represented, particularly in Series V: Artists and Series VI: Film, Television, and Theatre, are publicity photographs from a variety of sources, including public relations firms and production studios.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of photographs featured in the Irish Echo's photo morgue document Irish and Irish American people and communities, news events, and subjects throughout the greater New York City area. The collection also features numerous American and international figures and organizations interacting with Irish American communities.  Politicians, society events, sporting events, schools and youth organizations, musical groups, arts and cultural events, as well as visiting celebrities and dignitaries are among the most common subjects documented throughout the collection.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files are particularly rich in images related to Irish immigration and American assimilation processes during the latter half of the 20th century.  Numerous images of Irish and Irish American communities and their leaders provide visual documentation of the ways in which these populations negotiated their dual identities and transmuted cultural traditions. Furthermore, the materials featured in this collection provide insight on editorial decisions regarding the prioritization of news, specifically as it pertains to content.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of the collection consists of images taken in the United States, with the exception of Series II, which documents tourism, business, politics, sports, and various other topics specific to Ireland.  Additionally, there is no distinction made within Series V - VII between Irish and American origins.  For example, images in Series V: Artists, include photographs taken of American artists in Ireland as well as of Irish artists in America. Due to the multifaceted nature of the collection's images, individual events, people, or subjects may appear in multiple locations throughout the collection or within a single series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the prints show permanent evidence of their use, including crop marks, retouching by highlighting or shading, or other manipulation of the image. These marks are part of the record of a working newspaper and have been preserved as part of the history of theIrish Echo's photograph morgue. With the advent of digital photography and other technologies, the quantity of photos included in the collection declines beginning in the late 1990s, continuing steadily downward to 2004, which represents the latest date in the collection.</field>
