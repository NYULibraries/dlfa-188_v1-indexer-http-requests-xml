    <field name="scopecontent_teim">One of AFTRA's major functions as a union is to defend the rights and protections of its members. This series documents many of these cases, including those concerning pension, insurance, welfare claims, wrongful termination, protections for freelancers, contract violations, insufficient compensation, grievance procedures, and violations of collective bargaining rights. Particularly well represented in this series are AFTRA's cases against the Inner City Broadcasting Corporation and Tuesday Productions, as well as charges resulting from the 1981 National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians (NABET) strike. In addition to individual cases, the series demonstrates the larger issue of the right of the union to limit its members to working only under a union contract. Also included in this series are materials from binders entitled, "Monies Collected by AFTRA on Behalf of its Members."</field>
