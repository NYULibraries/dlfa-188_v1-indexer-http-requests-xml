    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series III: Administrative Files</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is comprised of the administrative files of the union including correspondence of its executives, officers, and legal representatives. Correspondence from Kenneth Groot and Irving Lewis are particularly well represented. The union's efforts on behalf of its members of color, as well as other disenfranchised members are highlighted through the work of the union's committees and the Equal Opportunity Commission. In order to keep all of the staff involved with the union's daily activities, Read Files (referred to as "Blues" in the National office) consisting of each department's daily correspondence were circulated throughout the office. This series also includes handbooks, financial statements, files on the union's pension and health programs, correspondence concerning the publication of Stand By!, files on the local union's elections (including petitions, ballots, results, and press releases), and Non-Communist Affidavits, required for all officers and board members.</field>
