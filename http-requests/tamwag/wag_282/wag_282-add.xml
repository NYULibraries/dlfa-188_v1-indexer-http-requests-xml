    <field name="abstract_teim">The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), founded in 1952, is a union of approximately 70,000 members representing professional actors, journalists, dancers, singers, announcers, hosts, comedians, and disc jockeys from numerous media industries, including television, radio, cable, sound recordings, video productions, commercials, audio books, non-broadcast industrials, interactive games, internet productions, and other digital media. The union traces its origins to the 1937 founding of the American Federation of Radio Artists (AFRA) with 400 members and locals in New York and Los Angeles. In 2012, after numerous attempts, AFTRA and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) successfully merged to form SAG-AFTRA. This guide describes the records of AFTRA's New York Local office from its founding through 1990. The collection consists of photographs, memoranda, correspondence, meeting minutes, financial records, formal agreements, recorded negotiations, constitutions and by-laws, and legal files documenting claims and arbitrations. The materials document the union's daily operations and governance, in addition to broader labor and social issues through the lens of entertainers and performers, including civil rights, anti-communism investigations, and workers' rights and protections. The collection also includes materials documenting the union's relationships and interactions with related domestic and international guilds and federations for performers.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of the New York Local Office of American Federation of Television and Radio Artists cover the period from its founding as a radio-only union in 1937, through the addition of television to its jurisdiction in 1952, up to 1990. This collection consists of meeting minutes, constitutions, by-laws, contracts, correspondence, handbooks, newsletters, written agreements, financial statements, programs and records of the union's annual convention, and legal files documenting cases involving members' rights, benefits, and protections.  The records also include materials documenting the New York union's relationships and interactions with related domestic (including other AFTRA locals) and international guilds and federations for performers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection documents many of AFTRA's claims, negotiations, and investigations on behalf of its New York members, including those concerning pension, insurance, welfare claims, wrongful termination, protections for freelancers, contract violations, insufficient compensation, grievance procedures, on-set safety, and violations of collective bargaining rights. Members include performers working for national networks and productions that happen to be based in the New York area (such as NBC or "All My Children"), as well as those involved in local productions or network affiliates (such as WNYC or performances from the New York Shakespeare Festival). Particularly well represented in this collection are cases against the Inner City Broadcasting Corporation and Tuesday Productions, as well as charges resulting from the 1981 National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians (NABET) strike.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Because of New York's historical prominence within the entertainment industry, the history of the local is a reflection of the history and progression of labor within the entertainment industry. The materials document the union's daily operations and governance, in addition to broader labor and social issues through the lens of entertainers and performers, including civil rights, anti-communism investigations, and workers' rights and protections.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) New York Local, founded in 1952, is AFTRA's union branch serving the interests of its members living and working in the greater New York City area, including professional actors, journalists, dancers, singers, announcers, hosts, comedians, and disc jockeys from numerous media industries, including television, radio, cable, sound recordings, video productions, commercials, audio books, non-broadcast industrials, interactive games, internet productions, and other digital media.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The history of AFTRA's New York Local is tied very closely to that of the national organization. It, along with Los Angeles, was the first local chapter established by the union's precursor (the American Federation of Radio Artists [AFRA]) and the national headquarters is also located in the city. The New York Local observes and advocates for its members' wages and working conditions by negotiating local contracts, recruiting members, educating its members on their rights, investigating grievances, filing legal claims, and inspecting working conditions through field representatives.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">New York's historical prominence within the entertainment industry, including the production of radio, television, journalistic, and soap opera programming, have made it one of the largest and most active local chapters within the larger AFTRA union. The history of the local is a reflection of the history and progression of the entertainment industry. The local represents and advocates for members working for national networks and productions that happen to be based in the New York area (such as NBC or "All My Children"), as well as those involved in local productions or network affiliates (such as WNYC or performances from the New York Shakespeare Festival). Many prominent Manhattan-based comedians from the mid-20th century, including Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks, and Carl Reiner, joined and were represented by the New York AFTRA local as they became television performers. The local's legal representatives and field investigators administered numerous negotiations, claims, and on-set visits for the heavy level of daytime programming production taking place in the city, including talk shows and soap operas. The city's large media market, including broadcast news, local news media, and non-commercial educational media, contribute to the local's many members holding positions as announcers, hosts, newscasters, journalists, and disc jockeys.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The mid-20th century entertainment industry blacklist (also referred to as the Hollywood blacklist) that denied entertainment professionals employment based on their political beliefs or associations, real or suspected, created strife and dissent within AFTRA. The New York Local was especially vocal over the issue; their motions were sent to a national vote, but all failed. In 1955, the union passed a national referendum stating that any member who refused to cooperate with any government committee investigating alleged disloyalty or subversive activities "shall be subject to the charge that he is guilty of conduct prejudicial to the welfare of AFTRA" and may be "fined, censured, or expelled from the union by the member's local." In October 1997, AFTRA formally apologized for this position.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Major figures in the governance of AFTRA New York include Presidents Mark Smith (1938-1939), Alex McKee (1940), William P. Adams (1941-1944), House Jameson (1945), Clayton "Bud" Collyer (1946-1947), Nelson Case (1948-1949), Alan Bunce (1950-1951), Vinton Hayworth (1952-1954), Travis Johnson (1955), Charles Collingwood (1956), Luis van Rooten (1957), Virginia Payne (1958-1959), Bernard Lenrow (1960), Cliff Norton (1961-1962), Leon Janney (1963), Gene Rayburn (1964), Rex Marshall (1965), Carol Reed (1966), Mel Brandt (1966-1967), Kenneth Roberts (1968-1969), Kenneth Harvey (1970-1972), Jackson Beck (1973-1976), Martha Greenhouse (1977-1981), and Ann Loring (1982). Prominent former Executive Secretaries of the New York Local include George Heller (1937-1949), Kenneth Groot (1950-1952, 1955-1983), A. Frank Reel (1952-1953), Alex McKee (1953-1955), Reginald Dowell (1983-1986), Kim Roberts (1986-1987), and Helayne Antler (1987).</field>
