    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: Subject Files, 1928-1936. This series contains correspondence and other materials dating from Torgoff's high school and college years. Letters from Torgoff are mainly to women friends, including one to "Miss Stack," in which he describes his aspirations as a writer. General correspondence consists almost entirely of letters addressed to Torgoff, principally from women with whom he attended school in Colorado. Memorabilia includes a postcard picturing Feltman's Restaurant of Coney Island (where Torgoff worked and against which he led a successful strike) and a program for the American premiere of the film, Carnival in Flanders. Also included are Torgoff's high school yearbook and diploma.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">S eries II: Writings, 1932-1936. This series contains examples of Torgoff's published and unpublished writings, and includes essays, poetry, short stories, and notes. Also included are Torgoff's "Moods and Muses" columns, written while attending the University of Denver; and a number of papers written for school.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Leonard Sloan Torgoff was born in 1916. While attending Brooklyn College as an English major, Torgoff organized workers and led a successful strike against Feltman's Restaurant and hotdog stands in Coney Island, for whom he worked. When his mother died in January 1934, Torgoff took a leave of absence from school. Making his living as a plumber, he committed himself to becoming a writer and began to practice his craft. After a hitchhiking trip in Canada, Torgoff enrolled in night school at City College back in New York. In the summer of 1934 he left home again, this time traveling cross-country to Arizona, ending up enrolled in college at University of Denver in Colorado for the school year 1934-1935. There he wrote "Moods and Muses," subtitled "a literary column," for the college newspaper, The Clarion, in which he reviewed art, plays, jazz, food, poetry and books, and offered observations on beauty, love and war, among other topics. During this time Torgoff also continued writing poems, essays and short stories. Torgoff grew homesick for New York, however, and returned home after a year in Colorado.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In January 1937, Torgoff sailed to Spain on the S.S. Champlain to join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was assigned to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, and in February 1937 was in one of two trucks that were attacked as they drove into the fascist lines during the Battle of Jarama. Reports initially listed Torgoff as having been taken prisoner and executed, but subsequently it was established that he was killed in the course of the ambush.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Torgoff went by the nickname Leo or Leon; Sloan was his mother's maiden name.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The Leonard Sloan Torgoff Papers were donated to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives in 1985 by Carl Torgoff, Leonard Torgoff's brother. This collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of ALBA collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University.</field>
