    <field name="bioghist_teim">Alice Bache Gould was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1868. She was raised in Quincy and graduated from Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 1889 and continued her education in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and the University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois.  She was hired as a faculty member in mathematics at Bryn Mawr.  In 1903, her scholarly interest changed from mathematics to the study of the earliest voyages of Europeans to the Americas.  She spent seven years in Puerto Rico and most of four decades in Spain studying early European explorers.  She taught at a number of universities in the United States, endowed scholarship funds and left her research material to institutions in Spain and the United States.  She died on July 25, 1953 at her home in Simancas, Spain.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The Alice Bache Gould Papers were donated to the Spanish Civil War archives at Brandeis University by Augustus P. Loring, a nephew of Samuel Vaughn, in 1973. Additional letters were donated by Mr. Loring in 1985. This collection came to New York University in January 2001 with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archive collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University.</field>
