    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains clippings, writings, and correspondence related to Abraham Unger's work in support of individuals involved in the movement for Puerto Rican independence. These materials primarily relate the cases of Puerto Rican Independence Movement members Oscar Collazo and Juan Bernardo Lebron. Unger served as Callazo's defense attorney after Callazo and an associate attempted to assassinate President Harry Truman in 1950. Unger also served as council for Lebron who was brought on conspiracy charges for his connection with an attack on the US House of Representatives in 1954. Lebron was charged along with several other defendants, but was the only defendant represented by Unger. Materials related to Lebron's case primarily consist of legal briefs, Unger's notes, and correspondence between 1954 and 1955. The collection also contains general clippings and articles related to Puerto Rico and the independence movement and its leader Pedro Abizu Campos. Other materials in this donation include incoming letters to Unger (1948-1957), planning materials from the 17th Annual Communist Party National Convention, and articles related to communism and human rights.</field>
