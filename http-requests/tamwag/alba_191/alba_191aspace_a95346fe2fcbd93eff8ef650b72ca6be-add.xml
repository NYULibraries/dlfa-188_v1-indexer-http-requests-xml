    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains an assortment of documents and articles collected by Marion Merriman about her late husband Robert Hale Merriman. These materials largely consist of articles and essays about Robert Merriman's service with the Abraham Lincoln Brigades in Spain and stories about his death in 1938. They include newspaper clippings from the 1930s as well as articles and essays written about Robert and Marion Merriman in the 1970s and 1980s. The collection contains several photographs of Robert and Marion Merriman in Spain during the war as well as photographs of Marion later in her life. The series includes several files of newspaper clippings, scholarly articles, and essays about the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades (VALB) that Marion Merriman collected in the years after the Spanish Civil War. Several files relate to Marion's work on her 1986 biography of Robert, American Commander in Spain, which she wrote with Warren Larude. Also included in the series are transcripts of Robert's diaries, photocopies of his letter letters, a scrapbook of clippings about the Spanish Civil War, and two audio reels of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades.</field>
