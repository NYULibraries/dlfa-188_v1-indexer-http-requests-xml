    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection primarily contains correspondence from Italian prisoners of war during World War II. Various prisoners were at P.O.W. camps in Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, East Africa, South Africa, Australia, India, Great Britain, India, the United States, Italy, and Germany. The grouping of East Africa comes from the letters identified as coming out of the East Africa Command (E.A.C.) and/or the Middle East Command, both of which were commands of the Britishy Army. </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Following the 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, in which Italy surrendered to the Allies, Germany retaliated and occupied most of Italy to the north, creating a puppet state, the Italian Social Republic. Rather than continue fighting as allies of the German army, the majority of Italian soldiers and officers arrested by Nazi Germany and Italian fascists were taken to German internment camps in Germany or Eastern Europe. Instead of being called prisoners of war, Germany re-designated these detainees as "military internees" as a way to work around the rights granted prisoners of war, as outlined by the Third Geneva Convention. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Even after the armistice, there was no change in status for Italian POWs interned in Allied prisoner of war camps. Due to labor shortages in Great Britain, Australia, and the United States, they were retained as POWs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the Second World War, a group of Spanish volunteers and conscripts served in the German Army, fighting on the Eastern Front. They were called the Blue Division, or División Española de Voluntarios by the Spanish Army, and 250. Infanterie-Division by the German Army.</field>
