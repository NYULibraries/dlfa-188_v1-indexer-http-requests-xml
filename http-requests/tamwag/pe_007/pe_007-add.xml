    <field name="abstract_teim">The Printed Ephemera Collection on the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades. After first being rejected a charter by the American Federation of Labor, in 1936 the UE became the first union chartered by the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The UE collection consists primarily of agreements, contracts, and constitutions, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and publications. Ranging in date from the 1930s to the 1990s, the collection covers the tumultuous late 1940s and early 1950s when the UE left the CIO because of anti-communist campaigns.</field>

Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America consists of agreements, contracts and constitutions, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications. A sizable portion of the collection is made up of pamphlets put out by the UE on a number of different topics including, civil rights, communism, wages, record keeping, union busting and women's rights. The pamphlets are arranged chronologically by decade. Ranging in date from the founding of the UE in 1936 to the 1990s, the material in this collection was generated by the national and international bodies of the UE. The collection also contains agreements, fliers, pamphlets and other printed ephemera put out by UEs various districts and locals.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, also known as the UE, was formed in 1936. After being rejected a charter by the American Federation of Labor, it became the first union chartered under the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The UE saw a growth in membership during the war years to more than 300,000 members. In 1949, because of anti-communist campaigns, the UE left the CIO. Subsequently, the CIO expelled the UE along with ten other unions from its ranks. The CIO went on to establish the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) as a rival union. The UE tried to rebuild its membership throughout the 1960s and 1970s, however this was difficult and continued to be as membership was hit hard by closing plants in the 1980s. As of 2009, the UE continues to practice what it refers to "rank and file unionism" and remains unaffiliated with the AFL-CIO.</field>
