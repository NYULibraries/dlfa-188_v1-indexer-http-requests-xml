    <field name="abstract_teim">Thomas "Tom" Moran (1944-2012) was born and raised in New York City in an Irish-American working-class family. As shop steward of Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA), and later as safety director, Moran fought for workers' rights to a safe and healthy workplace, clashing with Con Edison over radiation exposure, asbestos, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), clean air, lead, and other instances of worker exposure to toxic substances without warning. Involved in several New York State Supreme Court cases as a plaintiff on behalf of UWUA, Moran represented workers in their struggle for workplace protections, legal enforcement, and provisions for protective equipment and preventive training. This collection, spanning Moran's work from 1975 to 1993, contains court records, correspondence with government bodies and advocacy groups, technical manuals, health and safety training materials, and citations given to Con Edison by regulatory bodies. These materials were collected by Moran in the course of his work as Safety Director for the UWUA and represent the issues, cases, training materials, and litigation related to the workplace safety of UWUA members working for Con Edison.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Thomas Moran Papers (1975-1993) document Moran's involvement in the labor movement in New York State, with specific regards to his years-long fight for workers' health and safety in utility professions. Beginning his career as a shop steward for Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Unionof America (UWUA) and eventually rising to the role of Safety Director, the documents in this collection trace Moran's involvement in various legal campaigns against hazardous substances as a violation of workers' rights.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Documents in this collection address Moran's involvement in three New York State Supreme Court cases: Ostrowski v. Local 1-2 (1980), State of New York v. Consolidated Edison, Inc. (1982-1986), and Moran v. Vaccaro (1989). These cases deal with workers' wrongful exposure to asbestos without appropriate warning or protections, themes echoed in much of the collection in sum. The files regarding Ostrowski v. Local 1-2 and State of New York v. Consolidated Edison contain documents filed in court by the plaintiffs and defendants including motions, affidavits, judgments, and subpoenas. Files for Moran v. Vaccaro contain official court documents as well Moran's original whistleblower complaint and narratives written by doctors regarding injuries sustained by Con Ed employees. Supporting documentation submitted as evidence is overwhelmingly represented through citations issued to Con Edison by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), hazardous materials testing and monitoring reports compiled in response to complaints, and individual complaints filed by Moran himself.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Moran's working relationships other key stakeholders in the area of workplace safety is documented by correspondence with government bodies and advocacy groups, notably with Nancy Stearns of the New York Attorney General's Office. This correspondence highlights the existence and enforcement of New York's 1980 "Right to Know Law," which stated that employers had to alert employees to the possibility of exposure to hazardous materials in the workplace and provide appropriate information on protective gear and safety and also documents lobbying work done by Moran and others, including lawyers he also engaged to represent him in litigation, regarding other workplace safety laws and regulations. Letters from Moran to Janet Fox, director of Safety Services at Con Edison, also evidence of how Moran utilized Local 1-2's legal right to request information on sample analysis reports that could prove illegal substance exposure.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection also contains safety guides and technical manuals that document the workplace safety issues which concerned Local 1-2 workers throughout Moran's career.</field>
