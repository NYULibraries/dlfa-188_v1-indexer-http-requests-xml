    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Mark Solomon Papers (dated 1974-2000) consist of bulletins, booklets, pamphlets, news articles and magazines documenting Solomon's research of and participation in the United States' anti-nuclear war peace movement during the later years of the Cold War (1979-1991). Topics for these pamphlets and booklets include nuclear disarmament, military practices in the United States and Soviet Union, human rights and motions for world peace. A bulk of the materials are from the 1980s. Drafts, lectures, outlines and essays composed by Solomon pertain to the history of the peace movement in the United States during the 20th century, the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1980s and U.S. foreign policy, specifically U.S. relations with the Middle East. Correspondence, proposals, conference agendas and presentations document Solomon's affiliation with the CPUSA's U.S. Peace Council and the World Peace Council.</field>
