    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries contains mostly research files of Counterattackon organizations that Counterattack viewed as possible Communist Party fronts, the bulk of which were collected in the 1940s. Much of the activity of the Communist Party took place in the context of working within mass organizations; those established by the Party were often referred to as front organizations. Mass organizations were usually devoted to a single issue or constituency and had a broader membership and political appeal than that of the official Party line. Some organizations within this series were known fronts, others were suspected fronts by ABC.  The materials in this subseries afford a perspective of both anti-Communist efforts to expose front organizations as well as the leftist political agenda of these alleged fronts in terms of postwar domestic and foreign policy.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> These organizations are mostly left organizations, including peace movements, political action and labor committees, progressive and civil rights groups, student organizations, schools and universities, and anti-fascist groups, including the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and other Spanish solidarity groups. The series also features multiple Communist country solidarity groups, including the National Council for American-Soviet Friendship. Documentation within each file is essentially an accumulation of information relating to certain suspected front organizations. Materials in the collection generally consist of newspaper clippings relating to the front's activities; pamphlets and other materials published by the front organization; leaflets, programs, and announcements of front rallies, meetings, and functions; and membership lists of fronts, including names and addresses. Counterattack  gathered any information they could to build a case and prove that they were Communist affiliated. There are some correspondence between organization and the editors of Counterattack, in response to Communist accusations.</field>
