    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Counterattack collected materials on countries, the Communist Party USA, CPUSA Front organizations, trade unions, individuals, organizations, foundations, and other subjects. The research materials are comprised of clippings, reports, flyers, newsletters, circulars, correspondence, and other ephemera. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">ABC monitored a wide range of publications to gather information for their research files. The materials are made up mostly of clippings, and to a lesser extent ephemeral material generated by the subjects of their investigations. Like-minded individuals often voluntarily provided information on organizations and individuals that were suspected of Communist affiliation through correspondence and typed reports. Interspersed throughout the files are office memoranda exchanged between Counterattack staff regarding research activities.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The research files were given a numbering scheme for reference and to create indexes and reports. These reports, the bulk of which are found in Subseries VIII, were prepared for internal use and at the request of outside parties. The range of organizations and individuals with files kept by ABC demonstrate their concern with the spread of Communism in the United States. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The American Business Consultants, Inc. (ABC) was founded in 1947 by former Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Theodore C. Kirkpatrick, John G. Keenan, and Kenneth M. Bierly. ABC was established as a source of information regarding allegedly subversive organizations and individuals, particularly those suspected of affiliation with the Communist Party USA. The organization was mainly funded by Alfred Kohlberg, a Jewish American businessman and fervent anti-communist who was a member of the John Birch Society and the China Lobby.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In May 1947, ABC began publishing a for-profit weekly called Counterattack: The Newsletter of Facts on Communism. The newsletter, headquartered in New York, sought to "combat communism and those who aid its cause." At its peak, Counterattack had a circulation of about 7,500, primarily in New York. Keenan served as Counterattack's  president and devoted much of his time to soliciting subscriptions from business executives and their corporations. Kirkpatrick took on the roles of managing editor and the publication's chief spokesman. Bierly was vice president and shouldered most of the responsibility for overseeing Counterattack's extensive research department.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In June 1950, ABC published a special report called Red Channels, which listed 151 alleged subversive individuals in the film, radio, and television industries. Red Channels made the relationship between ABC and the federal government especially apparent, as the publication recorded the number of times an individual had been cited by the FBI, the House on Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and other government agencies. The publication gained notoriety as the "Bible of Madison Avenue," as it was consulted by advertisers and network executives. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Many of the film and radio personalities listed in Red Channels charged ABC with libel suits. Though ABC successfully defended itself or settled out of court, the financial cost of the litigation and the questioning of ABC in the media, from both left and right-wing sources, were damaging to the organization. Of the original ABC founders, only Keenan remained with Counterattack after the early 1950s. Bierly departed Counterattack in 1951 and became a clearance consultant, working for clients like Columbia Pictures. Kirkpatrick, whose position as the newsletter's spokesman earned him the nickname "Mr. Counterattack," left the publication in 1952 in hopes of running for political office. The newsletter continued to be distributed in the aftermath of the Red Channels frenzy, but it was understaffed and in financial straits. By the mid-1960s, Counterattack's circulation had shrunk considerably, and in 1973 publication ceased entirely.</field>
