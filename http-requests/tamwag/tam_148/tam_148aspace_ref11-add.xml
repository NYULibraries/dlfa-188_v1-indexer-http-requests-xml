    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains research files and records of the Wackenhut Corporation which came into the custody of the Church League of America. They are a mixture of research files, correspondence, and administrative files for Wackenhut's library. Wackenhut's fastidious documentation of the activities of individuals and organizations make these files a strong source for information on players in Communist and left-wing politics in the 1950s-1970s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The research files are a mixture of clippings, essays, pamphlets, and other materials organized and frequently marked up by Wackenhut. Many of the research files were originally collected by former Joseph McCarthy aide Karl Baarslag and sold or gifted to Wackenhut. While the corporation's primary concern was monitoring the activities of Communist and left-leaning individuals and organizations, they collected materials from anyone engaged in the civic dialogue, including right-wing fringe groups. Taken as a whole, the files give insight into the range of activities that these right-wing anti-communists viewed as potential threats to stability in American society. The first 27 folders of the series, Subversive Activities, contain materials similar to the rest of the series, with a higher content of correspondence (much of it with Federal intelligence agencies), and research files on Vietnam War protests, espionage, and anti-communist efforts in Florida. These folders, and the series more broadly, point to the real and perceived connections between Communism, the anti-war movement, and the broader left counterculture of the 1960s, and document the right's evolving definition of "subversion."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Interspersed with the research files are administrative files for the Wackenhut Corporation's library. Many of these files are correspondence with publications, mostly dating from 1966-1967. Most of the subscriptions were obtained using the aliases Carol Ascher and William Jones. Like the research files, the publications reflect the full spectrum of political viewpoints of the period and document the range of actors attempting to shape American society during this turbulent period. The publications themselves generally are not included in the files.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Wackenhut Corporation was founded in 1954 by three former FBI men, including George R. Wackenhut. By the 1960s, the Coral Gables, Florida-based corporation was the third largest detective agency in the country. Wackenhut received numerous government contracts, both state and federal, and counted the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as two of its largest customers. By the 1980s much of their business was in administering prison security.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Wackenhut Corporation actively collected information on individuals, both to run background checks for their clients and as an outgrowth of George Wackenhut's anti-communist views. By 1971 the company had files on 2.5 million individuals. In response to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the company reduced the number to between 225,000 and 250,000 files. In 1975 they gave many of their files to the Church League of America, which was not bound by the disclosure requirements of the law. As a part of its anti-communist security activities, Wackenhut also published a monthly newsletter called The Wackenhut Security Review.</field>
