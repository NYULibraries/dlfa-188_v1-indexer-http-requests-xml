    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries mostly contains prepared reports created by Counterattack on individuals, unions, and other organizations, the bulk of which were created in the late 1940s and 1950s. These reports consist of information on activities and biographical and historical information on individuals and organizations that were considered Communist or sympathetic to Communists. These reports were a compilation of information that they collected, typed and often marked with one of the editors' initials in the corner of the report. The reports referenced any left-wing or Communist-linked activity of the individuals or organizations. Often these reports were created for people outside of ABC. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to reports, reference requests toward Counterattack's research department are included; they consist of an internal reference sheet and handwritten notes on the researched individual. Indexes are also found in the series; cross-referencing individuals and organizations found in earlier series.  Some of the indexes include references to the listed individuals in left-wing publications like The Daily Worker or Soviet Russia Today, in New York-based news source such as the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune, or in the reports on suspected subversive individuals compiled by Senator Jack B. Tenney, the chairman of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities. Other indexes include references to the individuals in this series in Appendix IX. Some of the internal reports within this series are duplicated in Series V. Counterattack's numbering scheme is maintained on earlier series to aid cross-referencing. Some of these individuals and organizational reports are duplicates that appear in different series within the collection.</field>
