    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains the research files of Counterattack on specific individuals, both well-known and lesser-known, many of whom ABC suspected of having Communist affiliations. Some of the individuals highlighted by Counterattack are recognized in the film and television industry or known for their work as musicians, authors, politicians, religious leaders, political activists, newscasters, labor leaders, Communist Party leaders, or academics. The research files primarily consist of newspaper and magazine clippings, usually with names underlined or otherwise annotated, and Counterattack's internal reports on alleged Communists (though there are also some reports Counterattack prepared for outside parties). This series is also comprised of Counterattack's internal correspondence, as well as collected flyers, pamphlets, publications, and circulars, including materials created by the Communist Party. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">To a much lesser extent, this series contains letters written to Theodore C. Kirkpatrick, Counterattack's managing editor, often with requests to research specific individuals. There are also several indexes which list references to individuals in other series of the Counterattack research files in this collection. Some of the indexes include references to the listed individuals in left-wing publications like The Daily Worker or Soviet Russia Today, in New York-based news sources such as the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune, or in the reports on suspected subversive individuals compiled by Senator Jack B. Tenney, the chairman of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities. Other indexes include references to the individuals in this series in Appendix IX, a seven-volume compilation of names of people who participated in alleged Communist front organizations between 1930 and 1944, prepared for the House Un-American Activities Commission by J.B. Matthews and Benjamin Mandel. Some of the internal reports within this series are duplicated in Subseries VIII.</field>
