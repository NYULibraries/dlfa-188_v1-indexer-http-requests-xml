    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Printed Ephemera Collection on the United Mine Workers of America consists of agreements, constitutions, reports, hearings and statements, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications, ranging in date from 1903 to the present. Included are industry wide national agreements on wages for anthracite and bituminous coal workers as well as transcriptions from hearings and statements from the United States Anthracite Commission and the United States Coal Commission, dating from 1920. On a range of issues from democratic elections to health and safety, the collection contains printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications. As a significant contribution to organized labor, the UMWA created the Welfare and Retirement Fund in 1946. Annual reports from the Fund are represented in the collection from 1950-1989.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) formed in 1890 with the merger of the Knights of Labor Trade Assembly No. 135 and the National Progressive Union of Miners and Mine Laborers. A leader in civil rights, the UMWA barred discrimination based on race, religion or national origin in its first constitution. The UMWA was a member of the American Federation of Labor and a driving force in the creation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. John L. Lewis served as president from 1920-1960. The UMWA, under his charge, created the Welfare and Retirement Fund in contract with the United States government, which permanently changed the way that health care is delivered to workers in the coal industry. In 1989, members of the UMWA in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky went on strike against the Pittston Coal Company, the strike lasted for several months and was greeted with wide-ranging community and union support. Today, the UMWA continues to fight for safe working conditions, good wages, benefits and fair representation.</field>
