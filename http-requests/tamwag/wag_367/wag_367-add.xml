    <field name="abstract_teim">Marian Swerdlow (1949 - ) is a sociologist, educator, a former New York City subway conductor, and a former member of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU), Local 100. Swerdlow was an active supporter of Local 100 opposition campaigns led by Arnold Cherry in the late 1970s and 1980s, and started the newsletter Hell on Wheels to disseminate information and support the slate of opposition candidates that later became the reform caucus New Directions. She published a memoir of her experiences, Underground Woman: My Four Years as a New York City Subway Conductor in 1998. Swerdlow taught sociology at the State University College at Buffalo, and high school social studies in the Brooklyn. As a member of the United Federation of Teachers, she was involved in the reform movements Teachers for a Just Contract and the Movement of Rank and File Educators (MORE). The Marian Swerdlow Papers (dated 1978-2020) consists of materials collected by Swerdlow documenting her experiences as a subway conductor, as well as the opposition groups and reform movements within TWU Local 100 in the late 20th century. Materials include newsletters, newspaper clippings, notebooks from meetings,journals, and ephemera concerning actions, strikes, contract campaigns, challenges to incumbent union leadership, Local 100 elections, Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) engagement with transit workers, and the safety and working conditions of transit workers. Opposition newsletters include Hell on Wheels and Rank and File Advocate. The collection also includes sociological papers and conference presentations by Swerdlow on various labor topics based in part on her personal experiences. This collection documents the working conditions of transit workers, coverage of TWU in the media, and the conflict in leadership within Local 100 between the incumbent Willie James and the reform movement of New Directions. The collection also documents Swerdlow's career as an educator, particularly her involvement with the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and the UFT reform group Teachers for a Just Contract. These materials include ephemera, notes, and correspondence, and document the conversations amongst rank and file educators on working conditions such as seniority, class size, classroom supplies, class preparation time, workday length, evaluations, and terminations.</field>
