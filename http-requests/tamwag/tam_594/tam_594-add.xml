    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection provides a broad view of Victor Navasky's life, his interests, and his work.  It contains personal items from as early as his time in the third grade at the Rudolf Steiner School, as well as school and military records, family correspondence, and samples of his earliest writings.  Material in the collection describes his first venture as an editor and publisher with the satirical journal, Monocle, and recounts the history of The Nation and Navasky's association with the magazine.  Among the books he has written or co-authored, three warranted individual series in the collection -- Naming Names (Viking Press, 1980); A Matter of Opinion (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005); and The Art of Controversy  (Knopf, 2013).  Each of these series contains extensive research material and varied products of Navasky's writing process, such as notes, outlines, drafts, typescripts and galley proofs.  Much of his other work is represented in the series "Other Navasky Writings," including his first book – Kennedy Justice (Atheneum, 1971).  The series also contains articles, essays, plays, and speeches, some with background research and other relevant items.  There are materials drawn from Navasky's continuing career at Columbia University and, also, a large series containing a wide range of subject files representing either research for books, articles, speeches, or lectures, or merely items collected based on Navasky's personal interests. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Correspondence appears across the collection, in almost every series.  Among the varied items are personal letters; communications with research sources and subjects, and with writers, publishers, editors and others involved in Navasky's many projects and activities.  There is also Nation correspondence, both internal and external.  Correspondents include many who are well-known, such as William F. Buckley, John Henry Faulk, Henry Kissinger, Molly Ivins, Anthony Lewis, Gus Hall, Elie Wiesel, Merle Miller, Sally and Cedric Belfrage, Hal Holbrook, and Merle Miller.   There is also correspondence to which Victor Navasky is not a party.  Examples include exchanges involving Albert Maltz, Dalton Trumbo, and Ring Lardner Jr.; also between Alice Orans and Frank Donner.  Among the highlights are photocopies of many letters written to early editors of The Nation from such notables as Clarence Darrow, John Maynard Keynes, Felix Frankfurter, H.L. Mencken, Franklin Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, Cordell Hull, and many others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Some of the topics and individuals may be found across multiple series.  Navasky's association with The Nation, for example, has its own series but related materials also form a large part of the research for A Matter of Opinion, and references to The Nation appear in other series as well.   Similarly, materials concerning Alger Hiss can be found in numerous places.  Although there are brief mentions in the series for the Monocle and Naming Names, most is to be found in materials associated with A Matter of Opinion  and in the subseries "Articles and Essays – Alger Hiss".  There are also Hiss items and research on Soviet espionage in "Subject Files". The Rosenberg Case, another of Navasky's long-time investigative interests, appears in research files for both Naming Names and A Matter of Opinion; in the articles subseries (a 1975 book review of We Are your Sons); in subject files; and in the audio-visual material.  Among other individuals who may be found across series are Carey McWilliams (Naming Names, as well as A Matter of Opinion,) John Henry Faulk, Christopher Hitchens, and Alexander Cockburn. Researchers interested in a specific topic or individual should search across all series.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains significant audio-visual material.  Of particular interest are audio recordings of a number of interviews Victor Navasky conducted for Naming Names and a special event sponsored by The Nation Institute, "A Conversation with I.F. Stone at 80."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Papers added to the collection in 2016 consist of 22 boxes of drafts, correspondence, administrative files, and research related to Navasky's work at the Columbia School of Journalism and his publications. Columbia School of Journalism materials include teaching files and course design materials, including correspondence with public intellectuals he invited to his classes as guest lecturers. These materials also include files related to the operation of two Columbia University publications, which were edited by Navasky, The Columbia Journalism Review and The New York Review of Magazines. Other materials related to Navasky's work at Columbia include correspondence and administrative files related the organization of the Delacorte Lecture Series 2001-2008, and transcripts of Delacorte lectures 2000-2013. It also contains significant materials related to Navasky's research on Alger Hiss. The bulk of these files include research related to the 1996 release of the Venona Papers and include correspondence with journalists and scholars about the revelations, copies articles, notes, and drafts of Navasky's writing about Venona. They also include several files related to the website The Alger Hiss Project, which was created in 2001 through grants from the Nation Institute. Additionally this donation includes some personal materials from Navasky's adolescence, organizational files from the Monocle, and five boxes of research files compiled between the 1990s and 2008. Many of the research files relate topics covered in other series and include copies of articles, drafts, notes, and correspondence.</field>

Navasky is Professor of Journalism and Director of the George Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism at Columbia University and serves as Chairman of the Columbia Journalism Review.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Victor Navasky was born in New York City on July 5, 1932, the son of Macy Navasky and Esther (Goldberg) Navasky.  His father ran a small clothing manufacturing business in the Garment District.  From kindergarten through fifth grade, Navasky attended the Rudolf Steiner School and then the progressive Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School.  After graduating in 1950, he went on to Swarthmore, where he earned Phi Beta Kappa honors and a degree in 1954.  His majors were English Literature and Political Science, with a minor in Philosophy. A stint in the Army followed (1954-1956).  He was stationed at Fort Richardson in Alaska.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After his military service, Navasky took advantage of the GI Bill to enroll at Yale Law School, earning his LLB in 1959.  While at Yale, he and a friend, Richard Lingeman, started a magazine of political satire, Monocle, which they continued through mail subscription after graduation.  They also published The Outsider's Newsletter and then The Radical Sporadical, with the last issue in 1965.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Navasky worked for a short time as a speechwriter for G. Mennen Williams, then governor of Michigan, and, after moving back to New York in 1960, began freelance writing for various publications, principally for The New York Times Magazine where he became an editor in 1970.   In 1971 Navasky published Kennedy Justice, an account of Robert Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General.  It was a finalist for the 1972 National Book Award.  By that time he had started a new book, Naming Names, the outgrowth of an article on the Hollywood Ten that he wrote earlier for The New York Times Magazine.  Naming Names would be published in 1980 and win the National Book Award in 1982.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During the 1970s, while working on  Naming Names, Navasky coordinated the New York senatorial campaign of Ramsey Clark, wrote a monthly column ("In Cold Print") for the New York Times Book Review, and taught for a time at New York University in its adult education program, as well as at a number of other colleges and universities. One course, for example, at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, focused on informers and cooperative witnesses.  Navasky was the Ferris Visiting Professor of Journalism at Princeton (1976-1977).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1978, Victor Navasky became editor of The Nation  and, in 1995, its publisher and editorial director.  Those responsibilities were handed over to Katrina vanden Heuvel in 2005, and Navasky became publisher emeritus.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1984, Navasky (with Christopher Cerf) published The Experts Speak: The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation and, in 2008, in a similar vein, Mission Accomplished! Or How We Won the War in Iraq, each book a compilation of the collective wisdom of many individuals presumed to know what they talking about, but who get it very wrong.  Navasky won a George Polk Book Award in 2005 for A Matter of Opinion, part memoir and part meditation on opinion journalism.  He released The Art of Controversy: Political Cartoons and Their Enduring Power in 2013.  His most recent publication is an eBook, The O'Dell File (2014).</field>
