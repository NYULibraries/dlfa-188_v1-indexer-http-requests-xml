    <field name="unittitle_teim">Subseries IVA:  Research and Related Materials</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This subseries contains research material of various types including correspondence; articles (many annotated by Navasky); court documents; bibliographic note cards, topical research (e.g., censorship, anti-Communism, Smith Act); and interviews or parts of interviews in various formats.  (Note that in Series X: Audio-Visual Materials, researchers may access a number of recorded interviews with individuals such as Albert Maltz, Fred Donner, Estelle Foreman, and Leo Townsend.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of those affected by the blacklist, the most extensively represented in the subseries are Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller, Albert Maltz, and Tony Kraber, although there is a wealth of material on numerous others.   Copies of HUAC testimony are available for a number of those who were called to appear before the Committee.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of particular note is a series of questionnaires whose respondents include Ring Lardner Jr., Will Geer, Elia Kazan, John Houseman, Lester Cole, and many others.  These documents were made available by Robert Vaughn, the American actor best known for his television role in the 1960s series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (1960) in The Young Philadelphians. Vaughn had continued his education during his acting career, earning a PhD from the University of Southern California in 1970.  His dissertation, which he published as a book in 1972  (Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting) was based on original research, primarily questionnaires and interviews.  Duplicates of the questionnaire responses were given to Victor Navasky in 1975.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to actual research, this subseries contains materials created in support of the research.  Examples include his address book at the time, calendar pages, correspondence, expense sheets, and documentation of a trip he made to California in June of 1976.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Some of the material in this series is in fragile condition.  Photocopies were made of a number of items. Researchers should utilize the photocopy surrogates as follows;  Box 20, Folder 13 contains originals relating to Censorhip, Blacklisting - surrogates are in Box 20, Folder 14; Box 23, Folders 7 and 8 are titled "Hollywood Reds" - surrogates are in Box 23, Folders 9 and 10; originals of material relating to Tony Kraber are located in Box 24, Folders 18 and 19 - surrogates are in Box 24, Folders 20, 21, and 22.</field>
