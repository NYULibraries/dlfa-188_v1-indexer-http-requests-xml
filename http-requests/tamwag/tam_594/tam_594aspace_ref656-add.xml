    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The amount of material associated with Navasky's Alger Hiss-related articles warrants its own subseries, although much of it is focused on a single piece - "The Case not Proved Against Alger Hiss."  The article is a critique of Allen Weinstein's 1978 book, Perjury: the Hiss-Chambers Case. Navasky conducted extensive research and interviews in preparation for the article, which appeared in the April 8, 1978, issue of The Nation.  Not only does this subseries contain material associated with the article's research and writing, it also includes relevant items subsequent to its publication.   An example involves Sam Kreiger, one of the individuals interviewed by both Weinstein and Navasky, who brought a libel suit against Weinstein in 1979.  There are documents from Krieger, Sam v. Allen Weinstein et al. which include Weinstein's deposition and a transcript of Weinstein's interview of Kreiger.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Navasky continued his criticism of Weinstein's work in a 1982 essay "Weinstein, Hiss, and the Transformation of Historical Ambiguity into Cold War Verity," which is included in a 1982 book edited by Athan  G. Theoharis titled Beyond the Hiss Case: The FBI, Congress, and the Cold War.  Correspondence, notes, research materials and working drafts are included.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials added to this subseries in 2016 largely relate to the 1996 release of the Venona papers. They contain clippings, articles, photocopies of the Venona papers, handwritten notes, drafts written by Navasky and others. Other research materials related to the Hiss case including copies of the FBI file of Victor Perlo, and published works about Hiss by John Lowenthal and Tony Hiss.  These materials also include correspondence with Tony Hiss related to the creation of the website Algerhiss.com.</field>
