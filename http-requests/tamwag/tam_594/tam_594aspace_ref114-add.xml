    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The initial series in this collection contains a variety of personal materials as well as biographical articles, resumes, and interviews.  There are many items associated with schools Victor Navasky attended, beginning with work he did in the third, fourth, and fifth grades at the Rudolf Steiner School, and continuing through the Little Red Schoolhouse, Elisabeth Irwin High School, Swarthmore and Yale.  It is clear from the material that he has continued his involvement with many of these institutions. There are also newsletters, yearbooks, and other items from his summer camp experiences at Camp To-Ho-Ne in the mid-1940s.  Correspondence is of a personal nature, much of it consisting of family letters exchanged with his parents whom he refers to as "M &amp; M."  There are military records, along with examples of his early writing while stationed in Alaska.  Several folders contain health-related materials, a good deal focused on arthritis.  Navasky has dealt with rheumatoid arthritis for many years.  Personal ephemera (including family members' ration books from 1943,1944), awards of various kinds, and a number of personal photographs are also included in the series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Early writing and personal correspondence added in 2016 include stories and poems written by Navasky in grade school. The bulk of the correspondence consists of letters to and from his friend Peggy McEvoy in the mid-1960s.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Because portions of the Camp To-Ho-Ne material were very fragile, it was necessary to create photocopies. The originals are contained in Box 1 Folders 11 and 12; however, researchers should reference the photocopy surrogates located in Folders 13 and 14.</field>
