    <field name="abstract_teim">Takako "Taxi" Wada (née Kusunoki) was a writer, editor, and activist whose career reflected her commitment to ensuring Asian American civil rights in the United States. In 1981 she closely followed the public hearings held by the Commission for Wartime Relocation and Internment Civilians all across the country. Materials in this collection include correspondence, testimonies, newsletters, event ephemera, newspapers and newspaper clippings, and other research materials, much of which focuses on the incarceration of Japanese Americans in the United States during World War II and the movement to obtain redress. Files include correspondence (much between Wado and William Hohri, lead plantiff in the National Council for Japanese American Redress lawsuit seeking reparations for incarceration), personal statements and testimonies submitted to Wada for the public hearing held in New York City on November 23, 1981, as well as transcripts of the hearing. In addition to materials concerning incarceration and redress, the collection includes materials documenting Wada's journalism career, her work with JASSI (Japanese American Social Services), newsletters and other materials for Asian American civil rights activism, and ephemera for Asian American cultural and community events.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Takako Wada Papers (dated 1945-2004) consist of materials created and collected by Wado documenting her journalism and activism for Japanese Americans and the broader Asian American civil rights movement. Materials in this collection include correspondence, testimonies, newsletters, event ephemera, newspapers and newspaper clippings, and other research materials. Many of the materials in the collection pertain to the incarceration of Japanese Americans in the United States during World War II, with specific emphasis on the movement to obtain redress and the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians public hearings. Files include correspondence (much between Wado and William Hohri, lead plantiff in the National Council for Japanese American Redress lawsuit seeking reparations for incarceration), personal statements and testimonies submitted to Wada in her capacity as English editor of New York Nichibei, a newspaper published by the Japanese American News Corporation, for the public hearing held in New York City on November 23, 1981 as well as transcripts of the hearing.

The witnesses include people who were incarcerated, government officials who ran and supported the mass forced removal and incarceration program, and organizations such as the Japanese American Citizens League and American Friends Service Committee. In addition to materials concerning incarceration and redress, the collection includes materials documenting Wada's journalism career, her work with JASSI (Japanese American Social Services), newsletters and other materials for Asian American civil rights activism, ephemera for Asian American cultural and community events, and issues of Japanese American newspapers or magazines, including Asahi Evening News, Bandwagon, Gidra, Getting Together, and New York Nichibei.</field>
