    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains the website for The New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA). Crawling of the website began in 2009. From 2009 to early 2013, content of the website was collected, but the formatting was not successfully captured. During that time NYTWA focused on campaigns related to protections against credit card surcharges, accessible taxi dispatching, increase of the jet fuel tax, health insurance for taxicab drivers, the Taxi Driver Protection Act, fare overcharging, lease caps to for medallions, yellow cab raises 17% in 2012, black car drivers strike, illegal pick-ups, and drivers relief and aid due to Hurricane Sandy at the end of 2012. In 2013, their website underwent a redesign. They focused on campaigns related to lease caps compliance, health and wellness, traffic rights, court rights, airport rights, the Owner Must Drive Rule, and repealing the MTA Tax. In 2015-2016, NYTWA worked on campaigns related to ride sharing apps to protect full time work for drivers, fair licensing standards and penalities, due process at the OATH Taxi courts, wheel-chair accessible vehicle (WAV) training, and road infrastructure change. In 2017-2018, the website contained actions and statements related to President Trump's Muslim travel ban, #DeleteUber campaign, full-time job protections, congestion pricing exemptions, racial justice and civil rights iniatives, and suicide amongst taxi workers. In 2019 underwent another redesign, mostly just focusing on action alerts and news related to strikes and lawsuits against Lyft, Uber and other ride-sharing apps; debt forgiveness campaign; and for hire vehicle (FHV) cap. In Spring 2020, taxi workers were considered essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the website included resource guides, information on unemployment insurance, financial assistance, health and safety, housing assistance, medallion debt forgiveness, remote learning, food assistance and other resources. The website also includes information ongoing litigation related to wage theft, unemployment insurance, drivers illegalling being "logged off" Lyft, and FHV cap. Other campaigns include raises for drivers by ride-share apps, license suspension class action law suit, and other policy proposals. The Twitter feed documents NYTWA's strikes against Uber over company's refusal to raise wages in 2022.</field>
