    <field name="abstract_teim">The People's Educational Camp Society (PECS) owned and operated Camp Tamiment, an educational and recreational summer resort (originally) for socialists and their families near Bushkill, Pa., from 1920 until its sale in 1965 to commercial interests. Camp revenues helped support the Rand School of Social Science and other progressive organizations. Camp Tamiment's success led to the revoking of PECS' tax exempt status in 1963. In 1972 PECS became the Tamiment Institute, thus taking the name of, and becoming identical with its subsidiary, founded in 1935 as the educational arm of Camp Tamiment. This collection contains minutes, correspondence, documents pertaining to PECS' tax status, brochures, programs, announcements and a brief history of the camp and the Tamiment Institute.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The People's Educational Camp Society (PECS), incorporated in New York in 1920, owned and operated Camp Tamiment, an educational and recreational summer resort (originally) for socialists and their families near Bushkill, Pa., until its sale in 1965 to commercial interests. As envisioned by its founders, members of the American Socialist Society, the Rand School's governing body, Camp Tamiment revenues helped support the Rand School and other progressive organizations, and provided the majority of the Rand School's funds between 1937 and 1956. In 1951, PECS took title to People's House, the home of the Rand School, and in 1956 the the title to the Rand School was transferred to PECS from the American Socialist Society. Camp Tamiment's success as a recreational resort under managing director Ben Josephson came to overshadow its educational activities, in the opinion of the Internal Revenue Service, which revoked the tax exempt status of PECS in 1963. This action contributed to the decision, later that year, to donate the Tamiment Institute Library (formerly the Meyer London Memorial Library of the Rand School), to New York University. On September 11, 1972, PECS became the Tamiment Institute, thus taking the name of, and becoming identical with, its subsidiary which was founded in 1935 as the educational arm of Camp Tamiment, and which later administered the Tamiment Institute Library for PECS from 1957 to 1963.</field>
