    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interview with Hynes was recorded in December 1991 at his office in the Municipal Building in downtown Brooklyn. Hynes discusses his childhood, family, and his involvement in Irish American affairs, starting with the 1981 hunger strikes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Charles J. Hynes (1935- ) was born in Brooklyn. As a second-generation Irish American, Hynes first remembers developing his Irish identity from the stories that his grandfather would tell him about emigrating to Boston and the discrimination against the Irish that he witnessed. Although a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians since the early 1970s, Hynes only became publicly active in Irish American activities during the 1981 hunger strikes. His outrage at how the British government treated the hunger strikers led him to join in the protests at the British Embassy and eventually to co-found Irish Solidarity Day.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hynes graduated from St. John's University Law School in 1961. He began his public service career as an associate attorney with the Brooklyn Legal Aid society. He later became a special state prosecutor in 1985, where he remained until he was elected as the Brooklyn District Attorney in 1989. Hynes has run two unsuccessful primary campaigns for other elected positions: the 1994 race for state attorney general and the 1998 race for governor of New York. He has also taught as an adjunct professor at St. John's Law School, Brooklyn Law School, and Fordham Law School.</field>
