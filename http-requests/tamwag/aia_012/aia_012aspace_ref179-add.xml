    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[03:36] Would you tell me the exact date of the beginning of this trial?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[04:14] Now, you were all acquitted, is that correct? Was there any aftermath or effect that the trial had on you or any of the defendants?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[04:59] What effect did the trial have on the function of Noraid?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[06:36] Who brought him down? The United States prosecution did? And then it was the strategy of the defense not to cross-examine him?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[07:38] What was the general effect, or even specific effect of the supply of arms to Ireland after the trial?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[08:00] But it did resume later?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[08:25 ] Who did the crowd consist of?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[08:51 ] Was it a large courtroom?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[08:55] Did the trial get a nickname? Were the five of you called anything in particular?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[09:12] Who do you think tagged that name onto you?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[09:31] Now that was in 1982. Had you any contact, anything to do with the hunger strikers that had taken place, with their activities that had taken place in 1981. Did you as Noraid or as an individual have anything to do with that?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[11:01] Was this done mostly through Noraid?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[11:32 ] Are there any other occasions that you can think of that in the 1980s that brought out large groups of Irish people that you were a part of?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[12:29] You're saying there was a lot of strength and unity during the hunger strike activities. And then after your trial in 1982 was there any support or any reason? You were still able to in other words able to raise funds.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[13:02] Tell me something about that [being grand marshal of St. Patrick's Day Parade] ? How were you elected?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[20:15] Did you almost feel like you were on trial again?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[20:41] Were you invited for instance to go on any talk shows, radio or tv shows where you actually got paid money during this time? Were you often paid?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[21:13] Who did the documentary?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[21:54] Could you please spell for me Nenagh where you said the monument was?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[22:26] Now this monument, what is it a monument to?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[23:06] Explain to me what went on when you visited the monument that they documented there.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[24:44] You mean the ambushes that had taken place many years ago during the Revolution?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[25:00] Do you play a part in any of these ambushes?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[25:26] Where did this documentary first appear?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[25:43] How did you find out about this documentary about you?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[26:18] How long did it take?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[26:28] Could you please tell me exactly to the best of your memory, what took place in the documentary footage?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[28:12] Did you ever find out who these people were that made this documentary?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[28:33] You mean cable tv?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[28:44] And you never paid any attention then?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[28:48] And obviously no one ever thought to give you a copy of this?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[29:06] Did you find the documentary complementary?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[29:36] Did you find it factual?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[30:08] What do you think was the purpose of this documentary?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[30:25] Did you feel used?</field>
