    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[02:37] When you were first captured, you obviously had to go through an interrogation?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[03:31] Did you give a false name?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[04:31] In other words, you would speak to somebody in prison and you would be introduced to him and you wouldn't even know he had a false name, is that what you're saying? That's how quiet everybody was?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[05:15] I guess you were afraid too that they were spies, was that part of it or not?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[05:27 ] Did you have certain codes or certain words that you'd use with each other so that you'd know that you were all part of the IRA?</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[10:29] You were interrogated in the first jail, the local jail, then you were brought to another jail you said. Was that a county jail? How did that work?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[12:06] So it was four feet of stone and dirt?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[13:24] Did anyone escape through this tunnel?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[15:40] How long did it take to build the tunnel?</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[16:08] Why were you in solitary confinement?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[18:44] So you had your own clothes in this jail?</field>
