    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[00:49] So are they planning a big celebration for you, for your 90th birthday?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[00:57] Do you happen to know where it's going to be held, since it's not a surprise?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[01:16] What is the date of your birthday?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[02:45] How did you celebrate your feast days?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[03:08] So this is a personal thing between you and your wife then to celebrate only your feast days? Do you have other friends who do this also or this is strictly between you and your wife?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[03:33] Was this passed down to you?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[03:50] Was this just your idea between the two of you or did you get this idea from some sort of family tradition?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[05:18] Don't you think that most people feel that celebrating their birthday - it's an event, it's a special occasion, it draws attention to somebody, to an individual, and they're special for that day.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[05:53] When you were growing up in Ireland as a young man, was your birthday celebrated in your home? Did your mother and father make a fuss over you?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[06:47] But still that made it special, different from any other day?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[06:53] Tell us about the time from about 1969 when political changes were taking place in Northern Ireland.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[12:38] At what time was this?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[14:39] Whose barracks?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[19:11] At what time frame did he start this Worker's Party?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[19:29] You were living here in this country in 1969. Yet, you were very well informed about exactly what was going on in the North of Ireland.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[21:47] There's been a direct line then between you and the IRA in the North of Ireland all this time, and there continues to be?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[27:06] When you say divided us...?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[28:20] You said that you founded Noraid in this country 20 years ago. Could you tell me exactly when?</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">[28:55] You were active then, the whole time up until 1986. What was your main focus and purpose?</field>
