    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 22 interviews with O'Dwyer were conducted between February 1990 and May 1991 in his office at the United Nations building in Manhattan. He viewed these oral histories as a sort of continuation of his autobiography, Counsel for the Defense, which was published in 1979. Although he discusses some of the issues also touched on in his book, such as educating African-Americans about voting in Mississippi during the 1960s, presiding over the New York City Council, and his participation in the 1968 Democratic National Convention, O'Dwyer also discusses his experiences both in Ireland and in America since writing the book.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviews contain much information relevant to Irish American studies, including insights into the history of Irish immigration and experiences in America especially in New York; the New York St. Patrick's Day parade; and Irish American athletics, radio shows, and newspapers. O'Dwyer recounts his experiences as a politician in the U.S., including running for various offices, the development and success of the McBride Principles, his relationship to the Jewish community in New York, his relationship with New York Senator Daniel Moynihan, and his work with the United Nations. He also discusses his experiences as a lawyer, including his involvement with professional organizations, such as the National Lawyers Guild and the Brehon Law Society and specific cases he worked on, such as the Fort Worth Five and Joe Doherty.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">O'Dwyer also discusses Ireland - the history of the discontent between Catholics and Protestants in the North, the civil rights movement, the 1981 hunger strikes, Irish travelers, and the development of the O'Dwyer-Cheshire home and O'Dwyer Forestry Foundation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Paul O'Dwyer (1907-1998), born in Lismirrane, Parish of Bohola, County Mayo, Ireland, was a politician and lawyer noted for his dedication to civil rights. Arriving in the U.S. in 1925, O'Dwyer enrolled in St. John's Law School the following year and graduated in 1931. In 1932, he joined the law firm O'Dwyer and Bernstein. He began his career defending pickets against labor-organizing injunctions, opposing the deportation of foreign-born agitators, and defending the rights of unionists to organize. He was a member of the National Lawyers Guild and served as president of the New York chapter in 1947.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">O'Dwyer gained success in the courtroom, participating in numerous civil rights struggles in America during the second half of the twentieth century. He worked at registration drives for African Americans in Mississippi during the 1960s, defended Communists and Communist sympathizers during the McCarthy era, vigorously protested the Vietnam War, and battled for the foundation of the state of Israel.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">O'Dwyer participated in politics both by working behind the scenes on other candidates' campaigns and by running his own campaigns. He assisted in John F. Kennedy's 1962 presidential campaign and David Dinkins' 1998 mayoral campaign. O'Dwyer's own campaigns were less successful. Out of a dozen electoral efforts, he lost all but two: the 1963 race for councilman-at-large in Manhattan and the 1973 race for City Council President.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">O'Dwyer managed to maintain his identity as an Irish nationalist and embrace his role as an Irish American. The quest for a united Ireland remained a high priority and during his frequent visits back to Ireland he met with all sides of the conflict, including the Irish Republican Army, the Ulster Defense Association, and the Irish government. He introduced the McBride Principles to the United States government, which prevent U.S. government agencies from investing in Northern Ireland companies that discriminate against their employees. He transformed his childhood home into the O'Dwyer-Cheshire Home for Disabled Children and Adults and established the O'Dwyer Forestry Foundation, both to fund the Cheshire home in the future, and also in an effort to reforest part of Ireland.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to his civil rights work in the U.S., O'Dwyer was involved in many Irish American organizations, including the United Irish Counties Association, the Mayo Men's Patriotic and Benevolent Association, the New York St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee, and the Gaelic Athletic Association. His love for New York City and its history led him to assist in the creation of the Department of Records and Information Services (D.O.R.I.S.) to oversee the Municipal Archives and to become the Manhattan Borough Historian in 1986. He was the founder in 1950 of the philanthropic Irish Institute of New York, Inc.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1990 O'Dwyer was appointed the New York City Commissioner to the United Nations and Consular Corps. In this capacity he was instrumental in having the Brehon Law Society admitted to the UN as a non-governmental organization.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After a series of small strokes, O'Dwyer retired to his home in Goshen, New York where he died on June 12, 1998.</field>
