    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: Subject Files. The bulk of this series contains ephemera associated with the Spanish Civil War, including certificates of honor and documents of affiliation with the Spanish Communist Party and the International Brigades. Other subject files include anniversary programs and newsletters from the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (both the New York and Bay Area posts), and the 60th Anniversary Tribute in Spain in 1996. Of note is a transcript of an oral history interview done by Art Day in 1986, addressing Goddard's involvement with the labor movement in the 1930s and 1940s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Correspondence. Each folder in this series contains both incoming and outgoing correspondence between the recipient and Goddard. The recipient's name titles each folder. Many of the letters written in Spanish include Goddard's own translation. The bulk of the letters, mostly to and from veterans of the Spanish Civil War, is between Goddard and former veteran John V. Murra. Murra's correspondence also contains clippings and other items that he sent to Goddard. Notable are letters between Goddard and José Antonio Valledor Alvarez, a former commander of the 15th International Brigade.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Howard Goddard (1911-1997) was born in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. The family moved to Southern California in 1921 and he took his first job when he turned 13. After graduating from high school he worked in Trona, California for a chemical mining company. His experience organizing and fighting for union rights in this company town (which involves one of the first landmark cases successfully argued before the National Labor Relations Board) solidified his belief in the workers' cause and the international fight against fascism. Arriving in Spain in March 1937 via the Pyrenees, Goddard was assigned to a Spanish-speaking company in the International Brigades. After recovering from wounds at Belchite and helping to plan the Battle of Ebro, Goddard was promoted to captain of his company in October of 1938. Goddard returned from Spain in late 1938 and continued to work and organize unions from Denver to Los Angeles, representing the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers for most of his career. He married and had two children. He was an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and at the time of his death was living in San Francisco.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The Howard Goddard Collection was donated to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives in 1997 by Esther Brown. This collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of ALBA collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University.</field>
