    <field name="abstract_teim">The Rosalyn Baxandall and Linda Gordon Research Files on Women's Liberation contain the research files of feminist historians Rosalyn Baxandall and Linda Gordon. Baxandall and Gordon are the editors of America's Working Women: A Documentary History, 1600 to the Present as well as Dear Sisters: Dispatches from the Women's Liberation Movement. The collection consists largely of printed ephemera from a number of short-lived feminist groups based around the US. This includes broadsides, brochures, cartoons, fliers, newsletters, pamphlets, and other publications. There are also several topical files relating to abortion, African-Americans, beauty standards, gays and lesbians, the media, pornography, and work. While the material ranges in date from 1948-1999, the bulk documents the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and through the 1970s.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Rosalyn Baxandall and Linda Gordon Research Files on Women's Liberation contain the research files of feminist historians Rosalyn Baxandall and Linda Gordon. Baxandall and Gordon are the editors of America's Working Women: A Documentary History, 1600 to the Present as well as Dear Sisters: Dispatches from the Women's Liberation Movement. The material in the files ranges in date from 1948-1999, but the bulk documents the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and through the 1970s. The Collection contains primarily research files on organizations and subjects. The majority of the files consist of printed ephemera, including brochures, cartoons, fliers, pamphlets, and other publications, which document many short-lived feminist groups of the era. Many of the documents found throughout the files highlight the grass-roots nature of the women's liberation organizations, shown through numerous hand-drawn fliers and publication cover sheets. The collection contains documentation from groups around the US. Organizations such as the Boston-based Female Liberation/Cell 16 and Bread and Roses, New York City groups, New York Radical Women, the Feminists, and Redstockings, as well as west coast groups, Seattle Women's Liberation and the Berkeley-Oakland Women's Union have materials in the collection. Topical files show Baxandall's and Gordon's interest in among other topics, the intersection of race and gender in the women's liberation movement, with files on African-Americans and civil rights, the fight for access to legal and affordable abortion and birth control, as well as beauty standards, child-care, gays and lesbians, the media, pornography, sterilization, and work. There are also a number of files from some of the early women's liberation conferences, both on the radical feminist side (Lake Villa, IL) and the socialist-feminist side (Ohio). A number of the documents in the collection were found and photocopied at other repositories, notably the Schlesinger and Duke Libraries.</field>
