    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series focuses upon the Northern Ireland conflict, commonly referred to as "The Troubles," which was a 30 year conflict fought between Nationalists (mainly self-identified Irish or Roman Catholics) and Unionists (mainly self-identified British or Protestants). It contains information relating to numerous subjects including, but not limited to: Armagh prison, Long Kesh prison, British reports on Northern Irish terrorist activities, anti-Margaret Thatcher and anti-British propaganda, news coverage of the Provisional Irish Republican Army's (IRA) assasination of Lord Louis Mountbatten, Bloody Sunday, the trial of John DeLorean, MacBride Principles, plastic and rubber bullets, as well as human rights in Northern Ireland.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Jack O'Brien Papers contains a large volume of material related to the Troubles, but within this series, it became evident that four categories featured more heavily than others. To reflect this, specific sub-series focusing upon the 1981 Hunger Strike, Irish American Organizations, the U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaties, and news coverage of the Troubles have also been created.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Materials in this series include correspondence, flyers, newsletters, photographs, speeches, official reports, Congresssional Records, press releases, interviews, book excerpts, posters, audio cassettes, and newspaper clippings.</field>
