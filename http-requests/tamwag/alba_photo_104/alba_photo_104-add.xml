    <field name="abstract_teim">Robert Steck (1912-), actor and social activist, sailed to Europe to volunteer for service in the Spanish Civil War with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in January 1937. In the following months, Steck served in the International Brigades with the First Regiment de Tren, where he was made political commissar; worked with British writer Ralph Bates, putting out the magazine Volunteer for Liberty; headed the Tarazona Base Cultural Commission, adapting his theater experience to the political and social realities of the war and creating skits performed off the back of trucks (known as "Buffoons on Trucks"); and was rifleman, runner and battalion scout for the Third Lincoln company. This collection includes images acquired by Steck in the course of his service in Spain and images of Steck, and others, from before and after the Spanish Civil War. The collection contains non-combat photographs of the members of the First Regiment de Tren, images of Carl Geiser in Spain after the Civil War and of Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in a solidarity parade held in the United States and one image of the "Night of Stars," a New York City benefit for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. The collection also includes portraits of Steck, images of Steck with his public school pupils and one image of Steck attending a picket and rally in Puerto Rico.</field>

In the following months Steck served in the International Brigades with the First Regiment de Tren, where he was appointed political commissar; worked with British writer Ralph Bates, putting out the magazine Volunteer for Liberty; headed the Tarazona Base Cultural Commission, adapting his theater experience to the political and social realities of the war and creating skits performed off the back of trucks (known as "Buffoons on Trucks"); and was rifleman, runner and battalion scout for the Third Lincoln Company. The photo collection reflects the range of Steck's progressive activities and concerns, including his long association with the communal adult camp, Camp Unity.

    <field name="custodhist_teim">The bulk of material contained in the Robert Steck Photograph Collection was donated to the Tamiment Library by Robert Steck in 1979. The remaining Steck photographs were donated to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives by Robert Steck between 1979 and 1998. This portion of the collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of ALBA collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University. The images in the Steck Photograph collection were separated from the Steck manuscript material at the time of processing.</field>
