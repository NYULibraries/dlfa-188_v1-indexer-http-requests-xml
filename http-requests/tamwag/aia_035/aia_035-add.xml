    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of interviews conducted with Irish immigrants by Frances Browner in 2006 for the book "When Mem'ry Brings Us Back Again."  A copy of the book is included with the collection.  Interviews are recorded on compact disk, also included in the collection.  Oftentimes, the recordings were made in public places such as restaurants or bars, and the clarity has been compromised because of the background noise.  The interviews were transcribed into narratives which comprise the book.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Interviewees describe their trips to America, usually by ship; sometimes by airplane.  First jobs, for the women oftentimes at Shrafts, a restaurant chain in Manhattan, the telephone company, with mass transit, for B. Dalton, a department store, as a professional musician and employed by wealthy families as domestic workers are discussed as are reminisces of social activities and outings.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">When available, duration of interviews is recorded and is included in the container list.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Aisling Irish Community Center is located in Yonkers, New York.  Established in 1996, the Center serves to assist Irish immigrants moving to the United States, much like the Emerald Isle Immigration Center in Woodside, Queens. The Aisling Center also provides services for the elderly Irish and Irish-American community in Yonkers and Woodlawn. This project of recording memories evolved from a program at the Center for Seniors called "Young at Heart."  Staff member Frances Browner initiated a creative writing class which focused on different themes and memories of the participants.  From the exercise the idea of recording the stories and creating the narrative was formed.  The result is the book While Mem'ry Brings us Back Again.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The participants tell of coming to America, the different ships they took, their impressions of New York - the weather, the tall buildings, navigating the subway, electricity and indoor plumbing - their first jobs, their friendships and social activities, and their homesickness.  For many, leaving to come to America was also the first time they had ever been out of their hometown.  Some came voluntarily; others were chosen or sent by a family member.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Transcripts and copies of original audio recordings along with a copy of the resulting publication "When Mem'ry Brings Us Back Again" were donated to the Archives of Irish America in 2006.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The archived website was migrated from the California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service to the Internet Archive's Archive-It Service in November 2015. The link to California Digital Library was removed in October 2017.</field>
