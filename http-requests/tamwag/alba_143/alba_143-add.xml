    <field name="abstract_teim">The material in this collection was accumulated during research for and production of the book, African Americans in the Spanish Civil War: "This Ain't  Ethiopia, But It'll Do" (G. K. Hall, 1992), and for an ALBA-supported research project on this topic.  The lack of available information on the approximately 90 African Americans who volunteered and served with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War spurred the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives support organization (ALBA) to pursue this project.  ALBA Executive Director Danny Duncan Collum was the book's Editor and Victor A. Berch, who was the archivist for the ALBA collection at Brandeis University, was Chief Researcher.  The collection includes files on individual volunteers, research notes, drafts of Robin D. G. Kelley's introduction to the book, permissions forms, meeting minutes, work logs, and publicity items.  Also included is one reel of microfilm containing relevant U.S. State Department documents.</field>
