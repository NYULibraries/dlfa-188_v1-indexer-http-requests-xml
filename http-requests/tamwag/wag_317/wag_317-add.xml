    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Jane LaTour Papers (1978-2023) consist of materials created and/or collected by LaTour in the course of writing Sisters in the Brotherhoods: Working Women Organizing for Equality in New York City, which was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2008. This monograph focuses upon the lives and experiences of 23 women working in traditionally male dominated jobs in New York City. The subjects of each chapter range from female firefighters, union officials, electricians, telecommunication employees, truck drivers, plumbers, and biomedical engineers. Materials related to the creation of Sisters in the Brotherhoods include proposals for her book; correspondence with interview subjects and LaTour's publisher; research files and notes focused on women in the labor movement and trade employment; and oral history interview transcripts. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains documents related to LaTour's Sisters in the Brotherhoods book tour in the form of promotional materials such as book advertisements, tour flyers, book tour invitations, and pamphlets; book reviews and press related to her speaking engagements; transcripts of speeches given throughout her book tour; print and digital photographs; and correspondence with critics, her publishers, and supporters of the book. Together, these materials provide insight into how LaTour came to write this book, why the subject matter was important to her, and the amount of work she applied to producing this monograph, as well as promoting it.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Throughout her career, LaTour also attended conferences focused upon gender equality, women's labor organizations, and labor history. To this effect, the collection contains materials from conferences LaTour attended and include transcripts of her speeches and interviews; conference programs; print and digital photographs; and background information about the conferences' focus and the organizations represented. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Jane LaTour Papers also includes copies of articles and lectures written by LaTour focused upon labor movements and women in non-traditional work roles; research materials related to the #MeToo movement and other topics of interest; correspondence between LaTour, friends, organizations she was affiliated with, and labor organizations; t-shirts from unions, non-profit organizations, and labor movements; and one VHS tape about female firefighter Brenda Berkman.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Recurring themes found across the  Jane LaTour Papers include racial and sexual discrimination, gender equality,  women in labor unions, vocational education, and pregnancy as it pertains to working women. These were all topics of importance to LaTour. Her extensive research and writings on these subjects; her numerous speaking engagements focused upon these subjects; and her active outreach within trades organizations, unions, and beyond – all of which is reflected in this collection – further establish her commitment towards gender equality and labor activism. </field>
