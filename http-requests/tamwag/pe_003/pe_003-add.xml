    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Bakery and Confectionery Workers' International Union of America, a pioneer of the North American labor movement, was organized in 1886. In 1969, it united with the American Bakery and Confectionery Workers' International Union. Again, in 1978, the Bakery and Confectionery Workers' International Union of America saw that it had common goals with the Tobacco Workers International Union, and so the two merged, creating the Bakery, Confectionery, and Tobacco Workers International Union. As another merger occurred in 1999 with the American Federation of Grain Millers, the union is known today as the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers International Union. As of 2009, the Union represented more than 120,000 workers in both Canada and the United States and its dedication remains strong in bringing economic and social justice to all workers in its jurisdiction.</field>
