    <field name="bioghist_teim">Women in the Fire Service (WFS) was formed by firefighters Linda Willing and Terese Floren in the early 1980s.  It functioned as a network and advocacy organization for women firefighters.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The beginning of the organization was the two women's decision in 1981 to publish a directory of women members of the fire service and a newsletter.  Although the first issue of both publications was produced in 1982, WFS was not legally established until the following year.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Throughout its history, WFS fought discrimination and sexual harassment against women in the fire services.  The scope of the challenge can been seen from the results of their 1995 survey.  Of the 551 women who responded, 88% reported having suffered some sexual harassment during their careers.  69% reported that they were currently subject to sexual harassment.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">WFS continued operating until September 2007, when it merged with the Women Chief Fire Officers (WCFO) to form the International Association of Women in Fire and Emergency Services (iWomen).</field>
