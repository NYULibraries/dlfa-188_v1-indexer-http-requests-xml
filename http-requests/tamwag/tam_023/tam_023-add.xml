    <field name="abstract_teim">The American Committe for Cultural Freedom was formed in the 1950s as an affiliate of the International Congress for Cultural Freedom and membership included prominent liberal and leftist artists and intellectuals across a broad political spectrum. The group's activity involved the organization and execution of numerous anti-communist campaigns and programs. As Cold War tensions diffused, the group disolved.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection primarily consists of the records of the American Committee for Cultural Freedom (ACCF), including correspondence, minutes, financial records and documentation of public activities. Significant correspondants include Arthur Miller, Bertrand Russell, Jean Paul Sartre, Norman Jacobs, David Reisman, Clinton Rossiter, George S. Schuyler, Stephen Spender, Gleb Struve, Harold Urey, and Karl Wittfogel. The records document the wide range of intellectual and artistic responses to Cold War issues. The collection also contains a small amount of organizational records from ACCF's predecessor organization, the Committee for Cultural Freedom, and its international affiliate, the Congress for Cultural Freedom.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The American Committe for Cultural Freedom (ACCF) was formed in 1951 as a result of the dissolution and reorganization of the Committee for Cultural Freedom (which was active from 1939-1951). The American Committee on Cultural Freedom was the U.S. affiliate of the international anti-communist organization the Congress for Cultural Freedom. Membership in the ACCF included prominent artists and intellectuals across a broad political spectrum. The activities and programs of the committee were generally informed by the staunch anti-communist orientation associated with the height of the Cold War period.  As Cold War tensions diffused during the mid-1950's, the organization first disaffiliated with the international Congress for Cultural Freedom and later folded in 1957. At the height of its activities, scores of artists and intellectuals were involved with the ACCF either as invited members, as participants in its numerous campaigns and programs, or as correspondents. In leadership roles and among the most significant correspondents were Daniel Bell, James T. Farrell, Sidney Hook, Irving Kristol, and Diana Trilling. Less actively involved but well represented by letters are Robert Oppenheimer, David Reisman, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., and Norman Thomas. Negative responses to membership invitations include Hannah Arendt and James Conant.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Transfer from the Tamiment Institute, 1963. The accession number associated with this collection is 1968.001.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The American Committee for Cultural Freedom (ACCF) was dissolved in 1957, and at that time the organziation's papers were stored with Norman Thomas, educational director for the Tamiment Institute. The papers were transferred to NYU in 1963 along with the rest of the Tamiment Institute Library's manuscript collections. Beginning in 1968 the permission of either Daniel Bell or Sidney Hook was required for researchers seeking access to the collection. Following the 1975 publication of John P. Diggins' Up From Communism: Conservative Odysseys in American Intellectual History, which quoted from the collection, Daniel Bell and Arnold Beichman requested that the collection be closed to researchers. The reason given was that the collection contained not only organizational records, but also papers of a purely personal nature which needed to be examined by the donors to prevent embarrassment to living individuals. The closure of the collection was met with displeasure by a number of historians. After extensive correspondence with Daniel Bell, Ronald Radosh initiated a petition to the Committee on the Professions of the American Historical Association requesting an investigation into the closure of the collection. Following the petition, Tamiment processed the collection and Daniel Bell selected a small number of folders which were restricted until the early 2000s. The remainder of the collection was opened to researchers in 1980. </field>
