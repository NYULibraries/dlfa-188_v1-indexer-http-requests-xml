    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) was created through the merger of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters Union and the Retail Clerks International Union following its founding convention in June 1979. William H. Wynn, president of the Retail Clerks International Union and one of the designers of the merger, became president of UFCW at the time of its founding. The merger created the largest union affiliated with the AFL-CIO. In 1983, the UFCW held its first regular convention in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. In 1984 and 1985 the UFCW pursued aggressive campaigns and organized 136,000 workers. In 1994 longtime UFCW staff member and organizer Douglas H. Dority was elected the second International Union President following the retirement of Wynn.</field>
