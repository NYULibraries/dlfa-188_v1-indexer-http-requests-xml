    <field name="abstract_teim">Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) was founded in 1982 with the merger of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and the New American Movement (NAM).  DSOC was led by Michael Harrington (1928-1989), the author of The Other America (1962). NAM grew out of the New Left and feminist movements. The Democratic Socialists of America is the largest socialist organization in the United States, with over 92,000 members, chapters in all 50 states (both statistics as of 2022), and a youth and student section, Young Democratic Socialists of America. The Democratic Socialists of America Records consist of materials created by the organization, its leaders, and its members from its inception to its current state. These materials include publications; national board and committee meeting minutes and agendas; local chapter meeting minutes; conference programs; member correspondence and mailings; reports and proceedings of the Socialist International, of which DSA is the U.S. affiliate; files on the DSA-founded Institute for Democratic Socialism; and files on other labor and left organizations, as well as websites created by the DSA. The collection also contains published and unpublished writings of Michael Harrington.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Democratic Socialists of America Records consist of materials created by the organization, its leaders, and its members from its inception to its current state. These materials reflect the organization's efforts to fight for reforms that empower working people through a variety of tactics, including legislative reform and direct action. Materials include Michael Harrington's early writing (both published and unpublished), which reflects positions later adopted by DSA; correspondence, memos, publications, resolutions, and mailings from Harrington's term as the chair of the Socialist Party, USA; letters documenting his resignation as chair and subsequent resignation from the party; and meeting minutes and correspondence of the Coalition Caucus, the predecessor of DSOC. Materials also include publications, correspondence, and meeting minutes from DSOC and the New American Movement (NAM) before they merged; also included are materials documenting the merger. Other materials consist of minutes, agendas, statements, and reports from DSA's governing bodies (National Board, National Executive Committee, and National Political Committee) and minutes, reports, statements, and publications from its various committees, commissions, and caucuses (including the Feminist Commission, Religious Socialism Committee, and the Democratic Agenda, among others). There is a large amount of material from the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA), which began as the Youth Section; included are convention proceedings, mailings, chapter reports, and executive committee minutes. On the national level, there are materials from the office (staff meeting minutes and correspondence); convention programs, papers, and speeches; events and projects (such as Justice for All and Center for Democratic Values, among others); publications (Democratic Left, Socialist Forum, and position papers); clippings and articles about DSA; membership mailings; and fundraising campaigns and grant applications. On the regional and local level, there are chapter meeting minutes, reports, and local convention programs. Additionally, there are meeting minutes, resolutions, and conference proceedings from Socialist International, and financial records, correspondence, and conference programs from the Institute for Democratic Socialism. DSA often worked with other organizations and unions with similar interests, like the National Organization for Women and Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union; included are printed matter from these organizations (brochures and newsletters) and conference materials. The websites of the national organization, chapter organizations, committees, YDSA, and other offshoots are also included in this collection. This collection also includes audio and video recordings of convention sessions, lectures, and television appearances by DSA leaders on analog and electronic formats. Additional born-digital materials contain mailings, printed matter (brochures, flyers, and conference programs), and position papers, mostly from the early 1990s-2010s.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) was founded in 1982 with the merger of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and the New American Movement (NAM). DSOC was led by Michael Harrington (1928-1989), the author of The Other America (1962). NAM grew out of the New Left and feminist movements. Harrington and others, including Carl Shier, left the Socialist Party, USA (later known as the Socialist Party-Democratic Socialist Federation, USA, or SP-DSF) over its support of the Vietnam War, and became the principal founders of DSOC. In its early days, DSA established chapters in virtually every state, including chapters at many colleges and universities; worked to build a progressive presence in the Democratic Party through its Democratic Agenda project; collaborated closely with progressive labor unions and leaders, feminists, and others to promote a social democratic agenda and a peaceful foreign policy; and advocated for socialism while strongly criticizing Communism. DSA also published Democratic Left, founded the Socialist Scholars Conference (now known as the Left Forum), and established the Insitute for Democratic Socialism. DSA is the largest socialist organization in the United States, with over 92,000 members, chapters in all 50 states (both statistics as of 2022), and a youth and student section (Young Democratic Socialists of America). It serves as the U.S. affiliate of Socialist International. The organization is committed to the idea that "working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few." </field>
