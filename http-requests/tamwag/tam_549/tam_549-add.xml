    <field name="abstract_teim">Steve Zeluck (1922-1985) and Barbara Zeluck (1923-2010) were Trotskyist, labor union, and occupational health activists. Steve Zeluck was active in the rank and file caucus Chalk Dust, in the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), and also was active in the White Lung Association, a group that advocated for those made ill by their exposure to asbestosis (Zeluck died of mesothelioma). This unprocessed collection contains personal papers, including correspondence and writings, organizational records, printed ephemera, periodicals (some annotated), relating to the Zeluck's activism in the Trotskyist movement, including within the Socialist Workers Party,  International Socialists, Workers Power, and Solidarity, and within the UFT, and the White Lung Association and other asbestos-related activity. The papers also document Barbara Zeluck's socialist feminist and women's health care activism. Most periodical titles have been transferred to the Library's print collection.</field>

Steve Zeluck was active in the rank and file caucus Chalk Dust, in the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), and also was active in the White Lung Association, a group that advocated for those made ill by their exposure to asbestosis (Zeluck died of mesothelioma).
