    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection spans the years 1961-1978 with the bulk of the material spanning the years 1970-1976. It consists of flyers, periodicals, leaflets, pamphlets, and statements which document American situationist, anarchist and libertarian activity and criticism. One significance of this collection is that it contains a critique of the New Left from activists of the same generation. Also included in the collection are items concerned with prisoner rights and eco-anarchism.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I, Bureau of Public Secrets, contains a brief history and publications of the Bureau. The folder and item arrangement are as specified by Ken Knabb in the Bureau catalog (folder 1). The second series, Situationist and Anarchist Material, consists chiefly of materials from other American situationist and anarchist organizations. The remainder is from England and the Netherlands. The folders in this series are arranged alphabetically. The collection provides good documentation of the ideas and activities of the Bureau of Public Secrets. However, the situationist and anarchist material in Series II is selective and not comprehensive. A good deal of this material was distributed by the Social Revolutionary Anarchist Federation (SRAF). Several periodical atitles in Series II were integrated into Tamiment's holdings.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Bureau was preceded by three organizations: "The Council for the Eruption of the Marvelous," January-June 1970; "1044," July-November 1970; "Contradiction," December, 1970 - September, 1972. The "CEM" and "1044" were self-described "neo-realist/quasi-situational" organizations. Their publications were distributed almost exclusively in the San Francisco Bay Area. "Contradiction" was a situationist organization which aimed at criticizing existing leftist movements. Members of the organization were members or ex-members of the Situationist International. Their publications were distsributed in the Bay Area, major U.S. and Canadian cities, and in Western Europe.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Bureau of Public Secrets was formed in the early part of 1973, and there is no documentation of its dissolve in this collection. Its key figure, who referred to himself as "Special Investigator," was Ken Knabb; financing and distribution of Bureau material was done by him. Bureau publications consist of some reprints of writings by the Situationist International, though the Bureau maintained autonomy from this organization. The objective of the Bureau was to disseminate information on situationist politics and philosophy.</field>
