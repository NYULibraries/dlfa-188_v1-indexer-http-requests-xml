    <field name="bioghist_teim">Anne Sara Cunnginham worked as the Press and Information Officer in North America for the Irish Export Board during the 1970s and 1980s. The Irish Export Board (Córas Tráchtala) was an economic development agency that emphasized marketing Irish-owned businesses and Irish products to global audiences. The Board was founded in 1959 and later merged with a private company. Enterprise Ireland, a government organization devoted to the growth and development of Irish businesses in global markets, superseded the Irish Export Board and other similar organizations. The Irish Export Board often emphasized fashion, home furnishings, and other consumer products, with notable campaigns focusing on Irish whiskey, a series of events at Bloomingdale's flagship New York City store, and the Statue of Liberty Centennial in 1986. During this time period, the Board and other similar organizations worked to create an identity for Irish businesses that extended beyond agrarian stereotypes, offering an alternate image of Ireland as a source for luxurious and well-designed products.</field>
