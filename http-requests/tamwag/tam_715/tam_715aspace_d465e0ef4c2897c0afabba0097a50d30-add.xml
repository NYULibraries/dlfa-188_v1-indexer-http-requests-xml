    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Websites for Cindy Sheehan's blog and online radio show, called the Soapbox. The blog dates back to 2009, but capture of the website began in 2017. Topics touched on by the radio show and blog include anti-war activism, United States militarism, environmental activism, war tax resistance, critique on President Barack Obama (including publicity for her book the Obama Files), nonviolent intervention, American imperialism, healthcare reform, Women's March on the Pentagon, establishment politics, and local politics in California. The radio show was also occassionally hosted by  Irene Sanchez, Matt Sedillo, and  Dakotah Lilly. It also includes the Revolutionary Organization of Labor (Ray O'Light) newsletter. In 2022, Sheehan stopped publishing on the Blogspot blog and began publishing on Substack, a newsletter platform. The substack contains episodes of her podcast, her video series with Dakota Lilly titled Shee-Lilly, and blog posts related to anti-capitalism and the anti-war movement.</field>
