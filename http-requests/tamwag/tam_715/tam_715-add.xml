    <field name="bioghist_teim">Cindy Sheehan (b. 1957) is an activist, author, former congressional candidate for California's 8th District, and former gubernatorial candidate for the state of California. Sheehan's anti-war activism stems from the death of her eldest son, U.S. Army Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan (1979 - 2004), who was killed in combat during the Iraq War. In 2005, Sheehan garnered national and international media attention when she established an anti-war encampment, later named Camp Casey, outside of President George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas. Camp Casey existed for five weeks, attracting the voices and physical presence of supporters and detractors alike. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sheehan is also a founding member of the Gold Star Families for Peace. Established in 2005, this organization is an affilite of Military Families Speak Out and supports families whose loved ones were killed in action during the Iraq War. In addition to her activism, Sheehan has written several books --Dear President Bush,Peace Mom,Not One More Mother's Child,I Left My Marbles in San Francisco: The Scandal of Federal Electoral Politricks, and The Obama Files: Chronicles of an Award-Winning War Criminal-- all of which discuss her political views as a part of her anti-war campaigning. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 2008, Cindy Sheehan ran against Nancy Pelosi for a seat in Congress, but was unsuccessful, having received only 16% of votes. In 2012, she was selected as the Vice Presidential nominee for the Peace and Freedom Party. In 2014, Sheehan participated in California's gubernatorial election and lost having only received 1.2% of the statewide vote. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Starting in 2009, Sheehan began hosting a weekly radio show where she interviewed individuals including Hugo Chavez and Howard Zinn. Sheehan also maintains a blog called "Cindy's Soapbox." </field>
