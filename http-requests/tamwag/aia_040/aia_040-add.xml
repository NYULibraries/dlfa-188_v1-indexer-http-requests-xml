    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Grimes Family is an Irish American family based in the greater New York City area perhaps best known for their ownership of the Irish Echo newspaper from 1955 until 2011. Patrick J. (Paddy) Grimes, a native of County Offaly, purchased the newspaper in 1955 in an attempt to promote the family's travel agency, Grimes Travel Agency. Through its domestic and international social, political, sporting, and entertainment coverage, theIrish Echoserved as a channel of communication and source of documentation for the Irish American community. For example, the paper produced brochures and journals for the various county societies and other social organizations in the 1950s and 1960s. Following Paddy's death in 1978, his son John became the paper's editor and publisher until his death in 1987, after which his wife Claire assumed the roles.</field>

    <field name="phystech_teim">Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</field>
