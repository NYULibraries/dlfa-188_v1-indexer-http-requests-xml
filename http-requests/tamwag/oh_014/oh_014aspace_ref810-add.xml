    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on April 18, 1974.  The interviewer and location are unknown.  The interview covers Minna Goldman's multiple immigrations to the United States (US) and returns to Romania, her working life in both countries, and her extended family.  Goldman discusses her multiple immigrations to the US between 1907 and 1920 and her reasons for returning to Romania before permanently settling in the US in 1920.  She discusses the pogrom that led to her initial immigration with her father and one of her brothers in 1907; the death of her brother during their travels; and her father's decision to return to Romania after six months in US.  She discusses her father's work as an umbrella maker and his decision to send her to work rather than school, in order to save money for their return to Romania. She describes her unhappiness at having to leave the US as she felt it had a more egalitarian society than Romania.  She recalls her decision to return to the US in 1910 and forego her education in order to work and save money to send to her family in Romania.  She describes her work refurbishing old umbrellas and recalls her decision to return to Romania when her family decided not to immigrate to the US.  </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Minna Goldman was born in Bucharest, Romania in the late 19th century and was the eldest of seven children.  She immigrated to the United States (US) and returned to Romania twice before settling permanently in the US.  Her first immigration to the US was in 1907 with her father and younger brother, who died in the Netherlands during their travels.  Goldman and her father settled in New York, New York, where her father worked as an umbrella maker and she worked in a blouse factory.  They returned to Romania after six months in the US.  Goldman returned to the US in 1910 with a cousin and worked refurbishing old umbrellas.  She saved enough money to buy passage for her parents and five siblings though they declined to travel.  She returned to Romania in 1912 and resumed her education.  After leaving school, she worked in a foreign language bookstore and for the American Red Cross in Bucharest.  She returned to the US in 1920.  She worked in a bank before meeting her husband, who was a pharmacist and owned a pharmacy.  She worked in the pharmacy until the birth of their daughter.  After the death of her husband, she worked for the Jewish Labor Committee in Manhattan.</field>
