    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by David Lamb in December 1973 at Sol Goren's home in Brooklyn, New York. The interview covers Goren's early life in David-Gorodok, Russia, his immigration to the United States (US), his life in the US, his union activity, and his family. Goren discusses his early life in David-Gorodok, including his education and his participation in a local smuggling operation. He describes David-Gorodok, including the fact that Jewish people lived among other religious groups in town; the fact that anti-Semitism was common; the social hierarchy amongst the Jewish residents; political instability, due to control of the town being passed between different Russian gangs; and the participation of the residents in the Zionist movement and the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia. He describes his immigration to the US and the fact that it coincided with a general emigration of Jewish people from his town. He discusses his family's assimilation in the US and their desire to leave behind all associations from the old world.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Goren discusses his working life in New York, New York, including his first job in a grocery store; a friend recommending him to a furrier; and his training in the fur trade. He discusses his movement through the fur industry, including opening his own fur shop on 7th Avenue in the Fur District neighborhood of Manhattan. He states that after World War II, the racial and ethnic demographics of the industry changed from being predominantly Jewish people from Eastern Europe to include more African American, Greek, and Puerto Rican employees. He describes the atmosphere in the factories and the relationship of the different ethnic and racial groups as amicable. He describes the conditions in the factories as poor but notes that he did not mind since he was happy simply to be in the US. He discusses the role of labor unions in the fur industry, including his membership in the International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada; his participation in strikes; attacks on strikebreakers by union members; and general violence during the strikes. He discusses attending union meetings infrequently and attempting to get along with his foremen.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Goren discusses his relationship with Jewish people from Germany and his prejudice against them, except for the Warburg and Lehman families, whom he respected because of their assistance to Jewish immigrants. Other topics include reading The Forward and Zionist literature; not participating in any political movements in the US; and becoming a US citizen.</field>
