    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Suzanne Michel at Hyman Glick's home in Brooklyn, New York on October 21, 1974.  One of Glick's grandsons assists in the interview but is not identified by name.  The interview covers Glick's childhood in Vilna, Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); his working life; and his family.  Glick discusses his education at a cheder in Vilna until the age of 18 and at a university in Dvinsk, Russia where he studied chemistry and trained as a dyer.  He discusses his wife and mother-in-law deciding for him to immigrate to the US in order to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army; living with his wife's relatives in the US; and his wife's uncle deciding he should change his name from Gleot to Glick because it was easier to spell.  He recounts finding and losing jobs in different industries before settling in the dry cleaning industry; the salary he received; and the number of days he worked per week at these jobs.  He discusses borrowing money in order to bring his wife and son over to the US and living in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  He recounts his business ventures, including buying two dry cleaning stores in Manhattan and buying and selling dry cleaning stores in order to make a profit.  Other topics include attending movies and the Yiddish theater on Sundays and collecting clothes from customers with a horse and wagon in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn.</field>
