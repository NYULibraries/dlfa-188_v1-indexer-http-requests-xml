    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Janice Albert. The date and location are unknown. This interview covers Morris Bagno's childhood in Poland; his immigration to various European countries before, during, and after World War I; his immigration to Canada and the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in New York and California. Bagno begins by describing his childhood in Poland, noting the differences between his small town and the cities that he encountered in the US. He explains that he received the equivalent of a college education at his local yeshiva while working with his father in the timber industry. He describes his decision to leave Poland in 1912 in order to avoid conscription into the army and to escape his father's orthodox Judaism. He recalls his immigration to various countries, including England, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada, before his immigration to the US in 1920. He recounts the awe he felt at seeing skyscrapers upon his arrival in New York City, which formed a stark contrast to the rural town where he grew up. He recounts working with his uncle for a short time before deciding to find a job on his own and his uncle's belief that he was indebted to and dependent upon him. He recalls joining the local chapter of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, which he remarked was special for its inclusion of women as members and the fact that women could hold high positions within the union leadership. He discusses his progression from a tailor to union delegate to supervisor and liaison between workers and employers. He mentions that he made sure to keep his home life and his work life separate as he did not want his wife becoming involved in union affairs. He notes that the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932 and the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 mitigated the effects of the Great Depression by preventing lockouts and allowing for unionization. He recalls temporarily relocating to Los Angeles, California in 1949 at the behest of the president of the union in order to deal with the rising tension in one of the locals between the Social Democrats faction, of which he was a member, and the Communist faction, who were viewed as dangerous to the union.</field>
