    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Josh Brown on May 9, 1973 at Helen Rothman's apartment in Manhattan, New York.  The interview covers both Rothman's life and that of her brother, David Klein, who was also interviewed for the New York City Immigrant Labor History Project.  She discusses her early life in Hungary, including living with an aunt and uncle in Hungary while the rest of her family returned to the United States (US).  She discusses her education, her parents' separation, and her aspiration to become a psychiatrist.  She recounts meeting her husband; moving to Budapest with him after World War I; and deciding to emigrate once BÃ©la Kun came to power.  She discusses her immigration to the US and her reunion with her family.  She recounts meeting her younger siblings and feeling shocked at the transformation of her family from upper middle class intellectuals to people concerned only with the management of the family shoe store.  She discusses her rebellion against her eldest brother, Henry, who controlled every aspect of the family, from how their business was run to how the family would vote in political elections.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In discussing her brother David's life, Rothman focuses on his involvement with Socialist Party of America; his erratic behavior and subsequent schizophrenia diagnosis; and the fact that the family had him legally committed to a state psychiatric hospital for over twenty years.</field>
