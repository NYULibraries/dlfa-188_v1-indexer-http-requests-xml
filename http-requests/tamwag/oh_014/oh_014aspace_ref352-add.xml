    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Edmund Lake at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens on 125th Street in Manhattan, New York on April 20, 1973.  The interview covers Clara Howard's early life in Hampton, Virginia; her family; and her opinions on racial discrimination and civil rights in the United States.  Howard discusses her education at the Gray School of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in her hometown, which she attended through the tenth grade.  She describes her family's home and explains that although they lived on a farm, they were near large cities, including Newport News and Norfolk, and did not live in an isolated area.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Howard explains that her older sisters migrated to New York and New Jersey and that she decided to migrate to New York when she was 16 years old after visiting.  She recounts living on 139th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan with her sisters in 1912; explains that African Americans were starting to move into Harlem at that time; and describes Harlem as beautiful, brightly lit, and clean.  She compares the living situation of minorities in downtown Manhattan to those in Harlem and her belief that the conditions downtown were more primitive than those in Hampton.  She compares her children's education to her own and discusses her opinion that she received a much better education as her teachers were Black, took great interest in their students, and served as role models.  She recounts an incident of racial prejudice one of her children experienced, her reaction to it, and her feeling that this exemplified the failing of the educational system in New York.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Howard discusses Marcus Garvey, Father Divine, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, and describes them as great men.  She recounts attending services and lectures at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.  She discusses Black empowerment, including Black leaders encouraging the people to pull themselves up but not providing them with the tools to do so and her feeling that most people lack the desire for education.  She describes her pride in her education; her willingness to defend herself and family against racial discrimination and injustice; her amazement at the fact that so few people in her community were unwilling to make a similar stand; and her willingness to die for her beliefs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Howard discusses her husband's first job with the United States Postal Service (USPS); the racial segregation within the USPS that led to his unhappiness; and his decision to start his own business.  She discusses her husband's jewelry and watch repair business in White Plains, New York, including the fact that the majority of his customers were white; his belief that his religious faith had enabled him to open his own business; and her management of the shop after he was injured in a car accident.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include leisure activities and holidays; theaters in Harlem, including the Alhambra; and Howard's enslaved grandparents who fled their enslavers before their two oldest children could be sold away from them.</field>
