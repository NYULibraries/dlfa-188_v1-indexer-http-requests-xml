    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Josh Brown, likely at Sylvia Greenfield's home at 299 New York Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.  The date is unknown.  This interview covers Greenfield's childhood in Hungary; her immigration to the United States (US) in the 1920s; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Greenfield begins the interview by discussing her love of the US, emphasizing the importance of freedom and economic opportunities.  She explains that the population of Hungary was split between the poor and the rich; that the poor could not afford to send their children to school; and that one could not marry outside of her class.  She recounts her father's conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army and capture by Russian forces in 1914; his six years as a prisoner of war; and her mother's decision to disperse her children to the care of her sisters in order to keep them safe.  She recalls her move to the Czecho-Slovak region of Austria-Hungary during the course of World War I.  She focuses on the opportunities afforded to the Jewish population there, citing her sisters' educations; free disability and sick leave benefits for workers; and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk's policies that provided food and education for the young.  She explains that she wanted to immigrate to the US in order to attend school and aid her family but notes that her father disapproved because he believed she would lose her religion if she went. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Greenfield describes the beginning of her immigration process in 1921; her initial denial of a visa due to the US's immigration quotas; and her arrival in the US via the ship Queen Mary in the late 1920s. She explains that she originally lived with her cousins in Sunbury, Pennsylvania but moved to live with a friend on East 10th Street in Manhattan. She describes her awe upon first observing the amount of people living in New York City and a strike that occurred the day she arrived. She explains that she worked predominantly in the garment industry, recalling that she was not paid at her first job on 38th Street and Broadway in order to learn the trade. She recounts her supervisor at a dress house at 1400 Broadway giving her six months' paid vacation in order to visit her family in Hungary. She recalls joining an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and acquiring better wages and hours. She describes earning enough money that she was able to pay her cousin back for the cost of the fare to the US and even help send her brother to university in Czechoslovakia, emphasizing the fact that she always sent money to her family. Other topics include the role Greenfield's parents played in developing her spirituality; her trips back to Hungary; the fate of family members that remained in Hungary during World War II; the friends she made in New York City; and her view regarding the refusal of many young people to go to war (presumably with Vietnam) at the time of the interview.</field>
