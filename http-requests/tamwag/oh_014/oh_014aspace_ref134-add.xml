    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Norman Newman at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home, Bronx, NY on May 2, 7, and 9, 1973.  The interview covers Fannie Marin's early life in Poland; her two marriages and the birth of her son; and her working life in the United States (US).  She discusses her immigration to the US in 1906 and having to leave her son in Poland with her in-laws until she was able to send for him in 1910.  She discusses her first jobs in the US, including sewing ribbons on pajamas in a factory and working as a practical nurse in a doctor's office.  She discusses her second husband, who was a painter and a member of an unspecified painters' union (possibly the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of America), and his death in 1923 due to lead poisoning.  She discusses her job as a fur finisher in her brother-in-law's shop and the different ethnic groups in the shop.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada) and political struggles within the union, particularly between supporters of Benjamin Gold and supporters of Morris Kaufman.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Fannie Marin was born in Poland in 1881.  Her family was Jewish and her father was a carpenter.  She married and had one son.  She immigrated to the United States (US) in 1906 after her husband's death.  In 1912 she married Mayer Marin and moved to the Bronx, New York.  They immigrated to Argentina in 1914 and lived in Buenos Aires until her husband's death in 1923, after which she returned to the US with her son.  In 1926 she began working as a fur finisher and remained in that trade for the next 25 years.  She was a member of an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur Workers Union of the United States and Canada).</field>
