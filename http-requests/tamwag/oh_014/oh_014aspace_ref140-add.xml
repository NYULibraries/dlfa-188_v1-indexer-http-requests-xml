    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Edmund Lake on April 5, 1973 at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens on 125th Street in Manhattan, New York.  Topics covered include Johnnie Meeks' early life; the impact of World War II on his daily life; his involvement with different communities and civil rights activism in North Carolina, South Carolina, and New York City; and his leisure activities in New York City.  Meeks discusses his family and his childhood in the Carolinas, including his two brothers; his grandparents, who were born enslaved; and the professions of many of his family members, including his mother's employment as a practical nurse and his father's employment in public works.  He recalls that the family was considered middle class; that his family attended church in Charlotte, North Carolina; an outbreak of smallpox in 1905, and other epidemics in North Carolina; and his participation in social activities such as church picnics.  He recollects his motivations for migrating to New York City, including the scarcity of work during the Great Depression; one of his aunts telling him that New York City was the best place to go for a better living; and his inability  to find work as a subcontractor because he was not a member of a union.  Meeks discusses the ways in which World War II (WWII) impacted his life, including using ration books; believing that the United States (US) government stole his car tires; being asked to donate aluminum pots and pans to the war effort; and not having a fear of Adolph Hitler attempting to attack the US.  He discusses his sons' wartime experiences, including their joining the military; being involved in D-Day; and being deployed to Japan.  </field>
