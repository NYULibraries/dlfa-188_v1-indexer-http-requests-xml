    <field name="scopecontent_teim">
Unidentified Russian Man:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewer, narrator, location, and date of this interview are unknown.  The main topics discussed include the narrator's expectations of New York, New York in comparison to the reality he experienced; his employment in both the garment and hotel industries; his political views; and his involvement with social organizations.  The narrator recalls expecting New York to be technologically advanced and prosperous; feeling disappointed when he realized that he would continue to be poor; and believing that he was lied to in regards to the economic situation of immigrants in the United States (US).  He discusses his employment in the garment and hotel industries, including being taught by his cousin how to sew on an electric sewing machine; not receiving compensation for the first three weeks of his employment; and working as a driver for an unnamed hotel during the summer months.  He recalls the 1916 dressmakers' strike and his membership in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The narrator discusses his political views, including joining the Socialist Party of America; voting in every election after his naturalization; and feeling that his step-children were registered as Democrats rather than socialists due to the way they were educated.  He recalls his involvement with social rather than political organizations; joining the Workmen's Circle for economic benefits and social reasons; attending lectures and concerts through the Educational Alliance; and the fact that his children were involved with the Young Circle League of America.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">
Rose Gelberg:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewer, location, and date of this interview are unknown. The main topics include Rose Gelberg's changing view of the Socialist Party of America; her thoughts about the Workmen's Circle and Educational Alliance, and their importance to the Jewish community of which she was a part; and the difference between her beliefs about Judaism and those of her children. Gelberg discusses her socialist tendencies, including being introduced to socialism through the Allgemeyner Idisher arbayṭerbund in Liṭa, Poylen un Rusland in Russia; joining the Socialist Party of America after her immigration to the United States (US); feeling differently about socialism at the time of the interview, but continuing to consider herself a socialist; and believing that the Socialist Party went through too many phases, which is why it did not survive. She discusses her thoughts on important members of the Socialist Party, including Morris Hillquit, Meyer London, and Norman Thomas.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Gelberg discusses the Workmen's Circle, including it being the only place where Jewish children were able to learn Yiddish outside the home; her opinion that it was more of a political than social organization; and the fact that she sent her children there to learn Yiddish. She recalls the Educational Alliance, including its goal to help immigrants assimilate into American society; its emphasis on learning the basics of the English language; and its focus on culture rather than politics. She recounts seeing the best socialist speakers there. She discusses the differences between the ways her children, her husband, and herself viewed their relationship to Judasim; her children practicing Judaism only on major holidays; and believing that they stopped speaking Yiddish because it was a part of a culture in which they had not grown up.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">
Hersh Rabinowitz: </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hersh Rabinowitz discusses leaving Palestine because he was unsuccessful in joining the political movement to build Palestine and was not interested in building the physical infrastructure.  He explains that he had emigrated from Russia because he wanted to continue his education and had been led to believe that there was a polytechnic institute in Haifa.  He recounts his disappointment in being misled about the institute upon his arrival in Palestine; finding work in the metalworking industry; and becoming the secretary of an unspecified metal workers' union. </field>
