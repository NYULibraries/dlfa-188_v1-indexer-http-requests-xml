    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Joan Granucci. The location and date are unknown. Main topics include Charles Saggese's immigration to the United States (US); his employment; his marriage and family; his leisure activities; and his political and religious views. Saggese discusses his immigration to the US at the age of 14; his father's promise that he could return to Italy if he did not like the US; and his belief that he would find gold in the streets in the US. He recalls his employment, including becoming a barber at his wife's urging but having to close his barber shop after he developed an allergy to the perfumes; working as a salesman for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; and working as an elevator operator. He discusses attempting to unionize the elevator workers in his building in 1936 and joining the Building Service Employees International Union Local 32B. He discusses his marriage, including asking his wife to refrain from working outside of the home after they married because he believed it was the husband's job to provide for his wife. Saggese discusses his children, in particular his son's education as an engineer and his work on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. He recalls leisure activities in which he participated, including attending the opera and joining the St. Rosalie Club, likely affiliated with his parish, where he served as a secretary. He discusses his political views, including being a registered Democrat and having a polling place in his barber shop. He discusses his views on religion, including considering himself Catholic but not attending church regularly and his belief that all religions were essentially the same.</field>
