    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted in Ponnie Johns' apartment in the Robert F. Wagner Houses in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. The date and interviewer are unknown.  The main topics of discussion include Johns' early childhood and a comparison of New York when he migrated and at the time of the interview.  Johns discusses his childhood in the southern United States (US), including his siblings and the death of their father in 1928.  Johns recalls growing up on a farm that produced cotton, tobacco, corn, vegetables, and raised animals; and moving to New York in 1930 to find work during the Great Depression.  His earliest memories of New York City include believing the apartment buildings were factories because he had never seen such tall buildings; joining the Shiloh Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan shortly after his migration; joining a Masonic Lodge in 1948; and paying six dollars to an agency to find him a job.  He compares New York City when he arrived and at the time of the interview, including increased crime rates; the changing use of a particular racial epithet; his opinion that children were not as well behaved as they once were; his belief that making less money made people less greedy; and that the younger generation does not know how to dance.</field>
