Topics include William Burke's early life, his immigrationto the United States (US), his work for the New York City Board of Transportation, and politics in New York, New York during the early 1930s.  Burke briefly discusses his childhood in Ireland, explaining how his family farm was passed down to his father; his brief education; and the emigration of his family from Ireland.  Other memories include the influence of the clergy in local government; the destruction of a nearby town by the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force; and and the way in which this contributed to his decision to immigrate.  His early recollections of the US include his spur of the moment decision to leave Boston, Massachusetts; finding work in New York City hours after arriving; traveling around the US (including Nebraska and Illinois); and his employment with the New York City Board of Transportation.  Within his discussion of his time with the Board of Transportation, there is a detailed discussion about the hierarchy of workers and their mobility within the department; the racial integration of the workforce; the guarantee of 48 hours a week once hired; and his position manning a change booth at the 168th Street subway station. </field>
