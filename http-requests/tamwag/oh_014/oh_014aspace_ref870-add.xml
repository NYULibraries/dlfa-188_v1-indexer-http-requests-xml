    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Santa Cigliano.  The date is unknown, and the location is likely the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814 Union Hall in Brooklyn, New York.  The interview covers Vincent DeMatteis' family and his working life.  DeMatteis discusses his father, including his work as a real estate agent in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a longshoreman.  DeMatteis describes his own apprenticeship to a jeweler, including some of the training he received.  He discusses his decision to become a longshoreman, against his father's wishes, as he was unable to find work as a jeweler during the Great Depression.  He describes different jobs longshoremen performed, including unloading, checking, and sorting goods from ships.  He discusses differences on the waterfront between the 1930s and the time of the interview, many of them being the result of the the creation of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor in 1953 and the success of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) in the 1960s in organizing the workers.  He discusses the structure of the work day; the way in which jobs were distributed; the way men obtained jobs as longshoremen; and the way ships were unloaded.  He discusses the ways in which longshoremen kept busy on days when there was no work; DeMatteis' household chores on those days; and the ethnic demographics of the piers in New York, most of which were controlled by Italians.  He discusses attempts at unionization on the waterfront; workers who wished for stronger unions being labeled communists; and the success of the ILA in the 1960s.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Vincent DeMatteis was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1909.  He had one brother and four sisters.  His parents and his four sisters were born in Naples, Italy.  Their father worked for the Bank of Naples in the real estate department before immigrating to the United States (US) in 1905.  He settled in New York and worked as a longshoreman.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">DeMatteis completed elementary school and was apprenticed to a jeweler in 1924.  He had to halt his apprenticeship in 1929 due to the start of the Great Depression and his inability to find work as a jeweler.  He worked odd jobs until becoming a longshoreman in 1936 and remained in that profession until his retirement around the time of the interview.  He served in the United States Army during World War II.  As a longshoreman, he worked mainly on Pier 1 on the Erie Basin in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn starting in 1945.  He was a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814).</field>
