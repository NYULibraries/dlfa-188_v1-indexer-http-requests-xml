    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Frank Faragasso on February 27 and March 6, 1975 at the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York.  The interview covers Rose Kriemer's family and childhood in Russia, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her union activity.  Kriemer discusses her family and childhood in Russia, including her father's occupation as a teacher in Kiev and the family's small farm.  She describes working in the US after her immigration and wanting to attend school, but being unable to do so as she was required to work overtime in order to keep her job.  She recounts returning to work in order to provide better opportunities for her children.  She describes the first factory in which she worked, including the decent working conditions; her salary; one strike in which she participated that brought in an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada); changes in working conditions and salaries after the factory was unionized; and her return to the factory after her children started school.  She describes herself as a fast worker and able to make a good living with piece work.  She describes the abilities of the other workers in relation to herself; the types of jobs in the factory; and the division of labor between men and women.  She discusses the system of work in the factory; the fact that some workers brought work home in order to make more money through the piece work system; and her decision to bring this to the notice of the supervisors.  She describes seasonal work, including working overtime from January to April and working two or three days a week the rest of the year.   She explains that most problems in the factory existed between the workers since the unions taught the members how to get along with management.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include her dislike of communists; the deaths of her family in Russia and the acquisition of their land by the Bolsheviks; and her confusion over the reason for their deaths.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Summary is available for this interview.</field>
