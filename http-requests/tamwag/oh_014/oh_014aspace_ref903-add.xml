    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Karen Kearns on May 7, 1975.  The location is unknown.  The interview covers Astrid Henning's working life in Norway and the United States (US) and her family.  Henning discusses her family in Norway, including her parents' occupations; her siblings; and her step-siblings.  She discusses her first job in Norway as a packer in a sardine factory; her decision to take the job because the wages would enable her immigration to the US; the fact that the men in the factory were unionized but that the women were not; and the fact that her salary enabled her to travel to the US in comfort.  She describes her reasons for wanting to immigrate to the US, including the number of children in her family and her desire to travel.  She discusses the women with whom she immigrated and the fact that they knew they would work in domestic service in the US, despite coming from middle-class backgrounds.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Henning discusses her jobs as a domestic worker in Manhasset, New York; Baltimore, Maryland; and New Rochelle, New York.  She describes her responsibilities and hours; her feelings of isolation on Long Island; and her employers, including their behavior, their homes, and parties they would host.  She explains that she was not responsible for heavy cleaning in any of her positions and that her responsibilities consisted mainly of dusting, dishwashing, and serving.  She describes the staff in the different houses in which she worked, including the responsibilities of each staff member; the types of people that were successful in domestic service; and advice she received from co-workers.  She compares the behavior of different ethnic groups in domestic service and her disapproval of the Irish workers, who would swear  while on duty and play cards late at night.  She describes the food that was provided for the staff at different houses in which she worked, including one in which the staff was provided only with leftovers until Henning complained.  She recounts being repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by male employers and warning the men that she would quit if the behavior continued.  She describes the experiences of her sister and other women who were sexually harassed and assaulted while in domestic service and their fear of losing their jobs if they reported these incidents.  She later recounts sexual harassment in movie theaters and on the subway in New York City; her fear of being alone in public because of these incidents; and the contrast between public behavior in the US and Norway.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include meeting her husband while at her first job on Long Island and their courtship; work experiences of her sister and cousin in domestic service and their employers, who included Hattie Carnegie and David O. Selznick; her inability to save money while working in the US; her frustration with people who would not learn the correct pronunciation of her first name; and her work selling advertisements for a Norwegian newspaper in the US.</field>
