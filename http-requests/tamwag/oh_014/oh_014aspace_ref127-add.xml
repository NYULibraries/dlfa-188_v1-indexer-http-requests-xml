    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Mary B. Alexander at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home in the Bronx, New York on March 21 and March 26, 1973.  The interview covers Charles Loskowitz's childhood in Russia and the United States (US), his immigration to the US, his working life, and his marriage.  Loskowitz compares his life in Russia with his life in US, including his surprise at the differences in the family's living arrangements; his confusion over laundry hanging outdoors on clotheslines; and his experiences at school.  He discusses his work at the Canadian Car and Foundry Company's munitions plant in New Jersey; the explosion at the plant in 1917; and his recuperation at a stranger's home.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Loskowitz discusses not being interested in joining immigrant organizations but in organizations related to his experiences in the US, in particular his occupation as a letter carrier and his Army service during World War I which led to his joining the National Association of Letter Carriers and the American Legion.  He discusses his marriage at length, describing his unhappiness in the marriage; the arrangement of the marriage by his mother and her cousin; and his children's relationship with him and his wife after the divorce.  He describes his wife changing her and their children's last name to Laskoe in order to Americanize it and his neutral feelings about this change.  He explains reasons immigrants would change their names once in the US.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include his children and their occupations; his opinions on Judaism and Catholicism; sports he played as a child; and songs he would sing with his family around the dinner table.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Summary is available for this interview.</field>
