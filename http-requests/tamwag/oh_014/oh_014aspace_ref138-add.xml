    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Mary B. Alexander on March 21, 1973 at Dora McAuley's home in the Bronx, New York.  The interview covers her family and her occupation as a dancer at the Cotton Club.  McAuley discusses her family, including the fact that her parents were married despite her father being white and her mother Black, and explains that this was common practice in port towns in the southern United States (US).  She explains that people in the southern US accepted segregation as a fact of life.  She describes meeting her first husband in college; running away from home to marry him in 1919; and living near Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.  She discusses becoming a dancer while escorting her daughter's dance troupe across the US and becoming a dancer at the Cotton Club in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan when her daughter entered kindergarten.  She recounts her time at the Cotton Club, including feeding people in bread lines during the Great Depression with other performers; the segregation between the performers, who were Black, and the audience members, who were white; and the code of conduct amongst the performers.  She discusses living with her daughter in England and France for three years while performing with a Cotton Club revue and hiring a private tutor for her daughter while in Europe.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">McAuley discusses her second husband, including the fact that his was the only Black family that lived in Augusta, Maine during his childhood; their move to Annapolis, Maryland in 1941; and their life there until 1955 while he worked for the United Service Organizations (USO).  She discusses her daughter's education.  She recounts living in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in order to keep her daughter isolated from other African-American families.  She recounts working as a dance instructor for the Police Athletic League before moving to Annapolis and her relationship with various police officers in Harlem in the 1930s.</field>
