    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Nina Cobb at Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union on Novemeber 12, 1975.  Other people can be heard conversing in the background.  This interview covers Lizziemae Thompson's childhood in Wilson, North Carolina; her migration to New York, New York; her work in Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx; and her involvement in Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union.  Thompson begins the interview by describing her childhood in Wilson, including her grandmother's plantation and the education and occupations that her siblings pursued.  She explains that she worked as a children's caretaker for multiple summers, noting that the family she worked for would go to Montauk, New York in order to visit the children's father, who was in the Navy.  She notes that these visits inspired her love for New York and prompted her to move to the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan with her husband and children in 1949.  Thompson briefly describes working as a substitute teacher for Public School 68 in the Bronx, New York and another unnamed school but notes that she went to work at Montefiore Hospital in 1959 in order to acquire better wages and more stable work.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The rest of the interview focuses on Thompson's experience at Montefiore Hospital and her involvement in Local 1199.  She details her work in the dietary department managing and serving patients' meals.  She emphasizes the different ways in which men and women were treated on the job; discusses tensions between the medical and support staff; and these tensions leading to difficulties in union organization.  Thompson describes the environment at Montefiore, noting the hierarchy of hospital employees; the issues and hazards of working with the hospital food trucks; the tight-knit community formed in the dietary department; and the ways her department's delegates aided other hospital departments.  She emphasizes the relationship between the union and the hospital, including reception of the union in various departments within the hospital; the impact the union and strikes had on working conditions and hours in the hospital; strikes in 1958 and 1959, and the community's support for the union; the active involvement of Black and Puerto Rican members in the union; and important members of Local 1199, in particular Teddy Mitchell and Leon Davis.</field>
