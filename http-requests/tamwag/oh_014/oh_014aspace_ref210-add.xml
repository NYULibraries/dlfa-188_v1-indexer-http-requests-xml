    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Karen Kearns at Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union on October 24, 1975. This interview covers Walters' childhood in Saint Kitts; her immigration to the US;, her marriages and children; and her working life, predominantly as a nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey; Fort Benning, Georgia; and Brooklyn, New York. Walters begins by briefly describing her childhood in Saint Kitts, noting that she lived with her grandparents, aunt, uncle, and sister; and that her grandfather owned his own land. She discusses her immigration to the US in 1917, including making herself appear older in order to board the ship; enduring the eight day voyage alone; and being unable to eat much. Walters describes settling in Jersey City with her mother and stepfather, who were the superintendents of a 60 family apartment building, and how she started working rather than continuing her education. She explains that she got her first job working as a telephone operator in her apartment building and was later hired as a nurse for the children of the Lerner family in Jersey City. She recounts meeting and marrying a chauffeur from Virginia in 1922, noting that she separated from him when he lost his job during the Great Depression and had no inclination to find another one.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Walters discusses her and her children's move to New York, where she worked various jobs before marrying her second husband, who served in the Army during World War II; traveling back and forth between the US and Germany with him between 1951 and 1956; and adopting another child in Germany. She describes taking a course in nursing while she lived in Fort Benning from 1956 to 1962; working night shifts as a baby nurse at the Brooklyn Community Hospital for 11 years when the family moved back to New York; and augmenting the household income when her husband retired from the Army. She recalls joining an unspecified union while at the hospital (likely Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union) but notes that her hospital did not go on strike because the administration acquiesced to their demands once they saw what was happening in other hospitals in the area. She describes her duties as a baby nurse and emphasizes the friendly relationship among the staff members in the hospital. Other topics include the lives and occupations of her children; her living conditions during the Great Depression; and racial discrimination in Georgia.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Alma Walters was born on February 22, 1903 in Saint Kitts and Nevis. Her father was a merchant seaman who died when she was young.  Her mother worked as a maid in Saint Kitts and remarried after immigrating to the US with her employers when Walters was five years old.  Walters attended school in Saint Kitts before immigrating to the United States in 1917 when she was 14 years old.  She married in 1922 and had five children.  She and her husband divorced in the 1930s, and she married her second husband in 1945.  She took a course in nursing at Fort Benning, Georgia in 1962.  She worked as a children's nurse for a family in Jersey City, New Jersey; as a nurse at Fort Benning, Georgia and in New York, New York; and as a baby nurse at Brooklyn Community Hospital in Brooklyn.  She also worked in different factories making lampshades and buttonholes.  She was a member of an unspecified union (likely Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union).</field>
