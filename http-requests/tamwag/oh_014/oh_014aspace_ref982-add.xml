    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on March 7, 1975 by Louise Mayo at an unknown location. This interview covers Bea (Gitlin) Artler's childhood in Poland; her immigration to the United States as a young child; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York. Artler briefly discusses her childhood in Poland, noting her father's occupation as a butcher, before moving on to describe her memories of her initial years in New York City living in the back of her father's butcher shop. As business declined in their initial location, Artler recalls the way in which her family moved throughout the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Artler specifically notes that they moved to better themselves, whether through better rent or living arrangements. She briefly describes her three years of school, placing more emphasis on the various jobs she held in garment factories making feather hat ornaments, children's dresses, and the fronts of ladies' dresses. She describes the conditions of the factories in which she worked as being acceptable, neither exceptionally dirty or crowded. She mentions the worker demographics as being split between Italians and Jewish people and that the two groups got along well within the workspace. She notes the delineation of work between men, women, and children and the tension between the manager and the employees due to his extravagant lifestyle. Artler notes that while she originally gave all of her wages to her parents in an effort to augment the household's income, she eventually contested this agreement and kept more of the money she earned. She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and her participation in strikes for higher wages, shorter work weeks, and greater job security, all of which the union eventually succeeded in acquiring. She recounts participating in union sponsored social events in order to stay informed about her community and going to movies and shows with the circle of friends that she made through the union. </field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Bea (Gitlin) Artler was born in Poland and immigrated to the United States with her family as a young child.  She was one of five children.  After immigrating, the family initially stayed with Artler's uncle before moving to Brooklyn, New York, where her father opened a butcher shop.  Artler attended school until she was fourteen, moving into the labor force as soon as she was able.  She worked predominantly in the garment district, making both children's and ladies' dresses, until shortly after her marriage.  Work was seasonally based, so Artler spent part of the year unemployed, varying from a month to half of the year.  While working in the factories, she became a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and participated in both social and union activities.</field>
