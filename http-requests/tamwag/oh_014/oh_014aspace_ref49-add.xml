    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewer, date, and location of this interview are unknown.  The recording begins with an unidentified woman discussing issues of racial differences and tensions in the United States (US) and appears to have no relation to the interview that follows.  The interview covers Eugene R. Duffy's childhood; work; and leisure time in New York, New York.  The volume of the recording fluctuates throughout the interview, and background noise sometimes makes Duffy hard to hear.  Duffy recounts his parents' immigration to the US from Ireland in order to better themselves; that they were the first members of their family to immigrate; and that they aided the rest of their family in immigrating and finding work in New York.  He recalls working in an unspecified wallpaper factory and on tugboats and yachts, explaining that there were few if any strikes in either industry.  Other topics include his family's religious and political affiliations; his visits to vaudeville shows and Central Park during his leisure time; and a comparison of the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan in the past and at the time of the interview.</field>
