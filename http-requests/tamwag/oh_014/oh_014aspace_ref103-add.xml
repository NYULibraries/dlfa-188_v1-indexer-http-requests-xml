    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on February 28 and March 28, 1975 by Jay Facciolo at an unknown location.  The main topics of this interview include Joseph Katz's childhood in Lithuania, his work in the garment industry, his education in the United States (US), and his union involvement.  Katz begins by discussing his early life in Lithuania, including having two brothers who became Hebrew teachers; living in a two room house which doubled as a small grocery store; and immigrating to the US in order to avoid the draft in Lithuania.  He describes his life after immigration, including arriving in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but immediately moving to Baltimore, Maryland to stay with a family friend; attending night school in Baltimore to learn English; training to be a cutter in the garment industry and being paid five dollars a week; joining the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union (ACWA) Local 15 in Baltimore; and moving to New York City  in order to find work when his Local went on strike.  Katz discusses his employment after migrating to New York, including transferring to the ACWA Local 4; being paid double what he received in Baltimore; attending an unspecified design school at night; and working seasonally.  He discusses his union involvement in detail, including his attendance at weekly meetings; his participation in votes regarding strikes; the lack of strength of the union in regards to negotiation with businesses; and the fact that the ACWA provided educational programs for its members.</field>
