    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on May 14, 1975 by Jay Facciolo and David Lightner at a senior citizen center in Brooklyn, New York.  At first Lily Campanile, Rose Davy, Agnes Mazza, and Giacomina Pasqua discuss their husbands' work as longshoremen and the ways in which they would acquire jobs.  They quickly start talking over one another and the interviewers decide to speak to the women in smaller groups.  Angelina Saltalamacchia and Rose Davy are recorded together.
  
The interview with Angelina Saltalamacchia focuses on her husband's work as a longshoreman, but also covers his working life in Italy and in the United States (US) before becoming a longshoreman; their immigration to the US; her working life before their marriage; and their children.  She discusses her husband's career as a longshoreman in the US, including how hard he worked; his salary; and the amount of compensation they received after he sustained a workplace injury.  She recounts the different jobs he held in the US before he became a longshoreman, including working for an unspecified telephone company in New York City and as a clerk in a store.  She discusses her reasons for immigrating to the US and other family members who immigrated before her.  She describes different jobs she had before her marriage; her work as a machine operator in garment factories; lists the locations of the factories in New York City and what each produced; and the work she did at each factory.  She describes her unhappiness at her first job, due to not being able to speak or understand English.  She discusses her children, including their birth dates; the death of one from leukemia; and the occupations of her surviving children.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interview with Rose Davy covers her working life and her family.  She describes her work in a mattress factory in Brooklyn, making burlap cushions for cars and boats.  She recounts having to carry 12 of these cushions at a time; continuing to work while she was pregnant; and losing her job when she was six months pregnant.  She discusses her father's recuperation after sustaining an injury in his work as a longshoreman; the compensation her family received after his injury; and the savings they accrued from this compensation.  She discusses, at great length, a cousin stealing her father's savings; the family moving from Brooklyn to Cleveland, Ohio; and her mother's work packing dates to support the family.  She discusses her work as a machine operator in dress factories in Brooklyn and her supervisor at one factory on State and Smith Streets.</field>
