    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interview with Vincent DePalo was conducted by Joan Granucci at the Congress of Italian Americans Organization (CIAO) Center in Brooklyn, New York on May 7, 1974.  Topics discussed include Vincent DePalo's childhood, his immigration to the United States (US), his family life, and his work experiences. DePalo discusses his early life in Italy, including being forced to leave school in order to learn stone cutting from his grandfather, and working building sidewalks and mansions. His earliest memories of New York include living with his grandmother; his father working out of town; lying about his age to get his first job making macaroni dies; and being surprised at the ready availability of food.  DePalo discusses owning a macaroni die company and the other good opportunities he found in America. DePalo discusses in great detail his family life including meeting his wife; gaining permission to court her; enduring miscarriages and other problems concerning children; having two sons; and attending the Italian Opera every week.  He briefly discusses the CIAO Center, including his enjoyment at being able to talk to the people there and the reasons that he joined.</field>
