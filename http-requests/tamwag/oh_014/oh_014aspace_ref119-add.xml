    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Suzanne Michel at the Bialystoker Home for the Aged on April 10, 1974.  The interview covers Samuel Levine's childhood in Brestowitz, Poland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1913; and his work in the garment and service industries and as a peddler.  Levine describes his childhood in Poland, recalling the various garment factories in which he worked from the age of 13.  He notes that he decided to immigrate to the US in order to avoid conscription into the Russian Army.  He explains that he first lived with his uncle in Portchester, New York before moving to Cherry Street in Manhattan.  He emphasizes the strong relationship between himself and his wife's family that developed over the years in which he boarded with them and after his marriage in 1916.  He describes working as a milliner, peddler, waiter, and cloakman, noting that although he initially made less money in the US than he did in Poland, the work in the US was easier.  Other topics include his education at night classes in New York; his wife's occupation as a trimmer; his enjoyment of the movies and Jewish theater; his US citizenship; and his children's education.</field>
