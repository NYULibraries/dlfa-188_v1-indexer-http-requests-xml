    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Cenen Moreno at the A. Philip Randolph Houses in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York on April 25, 1974.  The audio recording for this interview is missing.  This interview covers Cora Coker's childhood in Louisiana and Illinois; her migration to New York, New York; her jobs in domestic service and in factories; and her family.  Coker recounts her childhood in Hammond, Louisiana, noting that strawberry picking season interfered with her education.  She recalls Klu Klux Klan activity in her city; that white people owned many of the farms and businesses in the area; and the lynching of a woman named Emma Hooker.  She explains that her family generally had friendly relationships with white people, recalling that they lived on property owned by white people before her father built her family a house; that many people in her family were named after the family that owned the property on which they lived; and that that family sent them a wagon full of toys at Christmas.  She explains that her family moved from Hammond to Chicago, Illinois after her father lost his job for walking through a segregated railroad station and then fighting with the man who confronted him for it.  She compares Hammond and Chicago, noting that her neighborhood in Chicago was split between Black residents and Polish residents but that there was no animosity between the groups.  She explains that she quit school because she saw no future in it.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Coker explains that she migrated to New York, New York and settled in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York with her fiance's friends.  She describes her husband's occupation as a boxer and notes that, although he excelled in his sport, there were few chances for him to fight in big matches because of discrimination against Black contenders.  She explains that she found various domestic worker positions through an employment agency and that she worked less frequently outside the home after having children.  She recalls a contrast between being content and in love and struggling to make ends meet during the Great Depression.  She describes the differences between her relationship with her mother and her children's relationship with her, focusing on her efforts to communicate with them, including having monthly family meetings.  Other topics include her leisure activities and traditions; her father's occupation and income; her husband's death in 1943; her children's education and occupations; and a comparison between life in the northern United States (US) and the southern US.</field>
