    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Nina Cobb on December 6, 1975 at an unknown location.  The main topics in this interview include Callie Johnson's childhood in North Carolina, her work as a teacher and a tutor, her romantic endeavors, and her social life.  Johnson begins by discussing her early life in North Carolina, including her multiple siblings, their lives, and occupations; the death of her mother; her father's work as a minister; and her responsibility for her six younger brothers.  She discusses attending the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina in order to become a teacher; desiring to work as a teacher in Africa; and having to leave teaching because she became ill. She recalls her seven year engagement to a man she met in college; his refusal to marry before he completed his degree; and his death before their wedding.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Johnson mentions her work in New York state, specifically her employment in Mount Vernon as a tutor for a young boy; the fact that the family treated her extremely well; and her work teaching children with special needs.  She discusses moving to Brooklyn after her time in Mount Vernon; attending a Quaker seminary; and teaching religious education at different churches five nights a week for seven years.  She recalls her social life, including associating herself with mostly young professionals in New York; marrying because she was getting older; and not having a happy marriage because she realized her husband had married her for her money and property.  She discusses owning a boardinghouse for young working women; helping these women to support themselves; allowing the women to stay for one month free of charge and then charging them minimal amounts until they could afford their own room elsewhere; and deciding to create the house because she would have wanted help if she was in the same situation.</field>
