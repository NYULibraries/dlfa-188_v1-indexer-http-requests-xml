    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Howard Harris at the West End Italian Club in Manhattan, New York on April 8, 1975. This interview covers Primo Tossio's childhood in Rome, Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1926; and his work as a longshoreman in New York, New York. Tossio describes his childhood in Italy, noting that his education was cut short when his father fell ill and he had to work in order to support his family. He recounts his undocumented immigration to the US in January 1926; arriving in Baltimore, Maryland; and being assisted by local Italians on his way to New York. He describes his job as a longshoreman; his work in both Brooklyn and Staten Island; and the difficulty of loading ships due to the organizational work that accompanied it. He recounts joining an unspecified union (likely the International Longshoremen's Association); gaining a greater sense of job security; moving into management positions including hatch foreman and superintendent; and sending most of his salary to his family in Italy. Tossio focuses on the relationship between the workers and the stevedore, noting that the stevedore was paid more money. He explains that the stevedore would not hesitate to fire someone whom he felt was not working hard enough and that he maintained a small group of favored workers whom he consistently employed.</field>
