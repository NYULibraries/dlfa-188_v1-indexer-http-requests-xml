    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on April 2, 1973 by Jon Saul at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home in the Bronx, New York.  The interview covers Catherine Leddie's early life in Ireland, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her personal life.  Leddie recalls Ireland as a beautiful place in which everyone had plenty to eat, but that young people were eager to leave as there was no opportunity for them there.  She recalls enjoying the voyage to the US with neighbors and friends and knowing what to expect in New York, New York from listening to other immigrants who returned to Ireland recount their experiences.  Her memories of her working life in New York include searching advertisements for housework, as that was the only work available to Irish women.  She describes her first job living and working in the house of Henry Siegel in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan; being happy to work for the family; and enjoying their displays of wealth, especially their horses, carriages, and large household staff.  She discusses how, as she gained more experience, she was able to acquire better paying positions.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leddie recounts meeting her husband, a truck driver for a bread company, through one of her positions. She discusses having to stop working outside the home once she married and being busy caring for her five children. She recounts her and her husband's lack of interest in politics and the fact that they associated only with other working class Irish in New York. </field>
