    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Eric Perkins on May 21, 1973.  The narrator and location of this interview are unknown.  The narrator of this interview does not provide any information about himself.  This interview covers the reasons for Black migration within the United States (US); the history of Black sociopolitical movements; and the living and social conditions of Black populations in northern cities in the US.  The narrator describes reasons Black families would migrate from the southern US to the north, including a boll weevil infestation that severely damaged the cotton crop during the 1920s; the repression of minorities in the south; better education opportunities in the north; positive accounts from relatives; the economic opportunities created by the decreased immigration from Europe during World War I; and the idealistic mythology surrounding the north.  He recounts the ways in which racial segregation in the south gave rise to a Black middle class that worked toward fulfilling the needs of the Black community.  He elaborates on different sociopolitical movements that occurred between the Civil War and the time of the interview, noting that each of these developments assigned importance to different aspects of Black life. He discusses Garveyism, the Tuskegee movement, the Niagara movement, and the development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Topics relating to these movements include the liberation of Black people; the immigrationist movements; the development of the foundation of a strong Black economy; and the legal struggles for social and political equality.  The narrator focuses on the logistics of the typical migration, including how a single family member, usually a young man, would establish the living and financial situation before the rest of the family moved.  He explains that Black families typically settled in what he referred to as the Black belts of the city, crowded areas with poor living conditions that were eventually alleviated by public housing projects.  Other topics include the exclusionary tendencies of labor unions, which led to Black employees developing their own unions, especially for unskilled labor; the differences between the older and younger generations' forms of leisure and entertainment, and the differences between white and Black families with the extended family playing a much larger role in Black families.</field>
