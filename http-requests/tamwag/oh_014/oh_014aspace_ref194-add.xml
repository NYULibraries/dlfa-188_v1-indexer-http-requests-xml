    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Francis Facciolo on March 24, 1975 at an unknown location.  This interview covers Israel Tamovitz's life in Vilna, Russia; his involvement in the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1910; and some of his life in Pennsylvania.  Tamovitz begins by explaining his involvement in the Bund, noting that he learned about the organization through word of mouth; began attending meetings held in the woods; and keeping his coworkers informed about demonstrations and proclamations against the czar.  He discusses the relationships among factions within and outside of the organization; the relationship between the people and the police; Tamovitz's arrest; and his brother's involvement in the Bund.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Tamovitz recalls that his initial impression of the US was that of a beautiful, free country in which every person could go where he wanted and stay informed of government policies.  He describes the development of an unspecified miners' union in the Pennsylvania town where he settled; the impact John Mitchell and the miners' unions had on working conditions; and the decline of mining, which forced workers into other industrial occupations and trades.  Other topics include his brother's immigration to the US and the fate of members of his family that remained in Vilna during World War I and World War II.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Israel Tamovitz was born Vilna, Russia.  He was one of six children and had two brothers and three sisters.  His father worked for a freight station in Vilna while his mother stayed home and cared for the children.  Tamowitz immigrated to the United States (US) in 1910 in order to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army.  He paid an agent to smuggle him out of Russia and traveled to the US, arriving at Ellis Island, New York.  He settled in Pennsylvania with his brother.  He worked as a salesman both in Russia and in the US.  While in Russia, he was an active member of the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.</field>
