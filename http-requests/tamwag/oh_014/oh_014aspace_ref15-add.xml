    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Gary Tilzer at the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York during the spring of 1975. The audio recording for this interview is missing. This interview covers Stella Bialon's life in Poland; her immigration to the United States (US); and her husband's involvement in both an unspecified hatters' union and an unspecified millinery trade union. Bialon describes her childhood in Europe, noting that her family's wealth enabled her to attend school. She discusses her parents' opposition to her marriage because of the economic disparity between herself and her husband. She recounts that her brother owned a garment business in Manhattan, New York. She explains that she came to the US in 1910 originally on a three month trip but stayed there permanently, later sending for her husband. She describes her husband's dedication to socialism; his position as secretary and later chairman of an unspecified millinery trade union; the dishonest business practices utilized by employers to monopolize both the garment industry and its workers; and the contrast in freedom of speech between Poland and the US. </field>
