    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mrs. Wachsler describes her childhood in a small town in Poland, including her older siblings' hatred of her because their mother died soon after she was born; her sisters' work as housekeepers and hairdressers; and their education. She discusses her religious upbringing and the fact that the people in her town were Hasidim. She discusses the anti-Semitic laws in Poland that restricted the occupations for Jewish people and the fact that most Jewish men were salesmen, including her father who traded in fruit and nuts.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mr. Wachsler discusses his childhood in Hungary; his lack of religious education; and his early jobs in Budapest.  He recounts the political situation in Hungary after World War I, in particular the governments of Károlyi and Kun; his service in the Hungarian Red Army, despite his opposition to Communism; his membership in an unspecified Social Democratic party in Hungary; and his time in a concentration camp after the counter-revolution.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Wachslers discuss the Communist revolution in Hungary, including breadlines, unemployment, ration stamps, and the currency devaluation by the Communist regime.  They discuss the counter-revolution, including Horthy's puppet government and the different classes that fought in the counter-revolution.
