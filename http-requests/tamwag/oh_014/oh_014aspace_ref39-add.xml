    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Manfred Putzka at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home in the Bronx, New York on April 9, 1973. Topics include Maud Cowen's childhood, her immigration to the United States (US), her first impressions of the US, her employment, and her family. Cowen recounts her early life in Jamaica including her large family; her father owning a farm and her recollection of shipping oranges in barrels and raising animals; and teaching herself how to make dresses. Cowen discusses her negative first impressions of the US, including feeling out of place and crying every night; feeling that people were unfriendly; and that she never had enough money. She recalls the US attempting to deport her to Jamaica or Great Britain during World War I and fighting the deportation. Cowan discusses her employment, including working at an ammunition factory in New Jersey; working in a laundry pressing soldiers' uniforms; sewing dresses in the Garment District neighborhood of Manhattan; working as a kosher cook; and being a maid and companion in a hospital. Cowen discusses her kosher cooking, including learning from a Jewish woman for whom she worked; and cooking for individuals as well as catering parties. She discusses her daughters in detail, including the fact that they were both well educated and married, that both wanted her to move back to Jamaica at the time of the interview; and that one daughter owns 40 acres of land with a large house and a maid.</field>
