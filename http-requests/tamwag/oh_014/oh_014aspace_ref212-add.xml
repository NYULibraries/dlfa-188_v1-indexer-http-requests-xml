    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Louise Mayo on March 2, March 28, and April 11, 1975 at Jean Weiner's daughter's home and other unspecified locations.  The interview covers Jean Weiner's childhood in Bessarabia, Russia; her family's life after their immigration to the United States (US); her working life; and her union activity.  Weiner describes the daily life of her family in Bessarabia in great detail, including specifics on her father's tailoring business; the food her mother would prepare for the family; how her mother made extra money while her father was in the US; and the importance her father placed on education.  She describes the different types of apartments the family rented as they moved into better apartments in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before being able to afford a private house on Vermont Street in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn.  She recounts that the family had boarders; that her many relatives would frequently visit; how she enjoyed having so many people in the house; and that family and friends would help each other in times of need or illness.  She compares the way the family lived in Russia to their life in the US, describing the variety of meat that was available in the US; the way the family shopped for food and goods, mainly from pushcarts on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side; and the different status levels amongst the working class in both countries, which were determined by a person's profession.  She recounts her working life, which began soon after she arrived in the US; how much money she was expected to contribute to the household; the division of labor between men and women; and the fact that there were certain jobs that only men could do.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While Weiner does not specify to which union she belonged (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union), she describes her union activity in great detail.  She recounts the benefits to working in a union shop and a strike in which she participated.  She describes in great detail the chairwoman of her local, whom she describes as well-educated, radical, and a socialist.  She discusses deciding to take a vacation from work as she had enough money to do so and spending the summer with her mother and siblings in Huntington, Connecticut; she and her sister flirting with young men in front of a country store near their camp; and meeting her husband through one of these men.  Other topics include the family's more secular life in the US; the Jewish street gang, The Little Augies; life in Jewish neighborhoods in New York City; and pride in her ability to work so that her youngest brother and sister were able to graduate high school and attend college.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jean Weiner was born in a small village in Bessarabia, Russia and was one of four children.  Her father was a tailor and immigrated to the United States in the first decade of the 20th century.  He worked as a finisher on ladies' coats, suits, and capes.  The rest of the family joined him four years later and lived on Clinton Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Weiner worked as a seamstress in ladies' garment and underwear factories.  She was a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union).  She was married.</field>
