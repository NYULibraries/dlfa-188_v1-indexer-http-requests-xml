    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interviewed was conducted by Martin Lesser on March 28, 1973 at Bella Farkas' home in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York.  The interview covers Farkas' early life in Poland, her immigration to the United States (US), her working life, and her union activity.  She describes life in her town during and after World War I, including occupation by German soldiers and rising anti-Semitism in the town after Poland gained its independence from the Russian Empire in 1918.  She describes her immigration to the US and her happiness in coming to the US.  She recalls living in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn and her preference for Harlem.  She discusses working for private dressmakers and traveling from Williamsburg into lower Manhattan to work.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union); the differences in working for a union shop and a non-union shop; and strikes in which she was involved during the 1930s.</field>
