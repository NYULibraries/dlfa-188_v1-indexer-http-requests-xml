    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Scott Weir at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan, New York on April 29 and June 6, 1974.  Main topics discussed include John Leonard's family and childhood; his work experience; and his participation in World War I (WWI), his leisure activities; and his politics.  Leonard discusses his family, including his parents' emigration from Ireland; his father's employment with the New York City Department of Street Cleaning; his six siblings; the death of his parents; and his lack of emotional support after the death of his mother in 1915.  He recalls his childhood, including living in different areas of Manhattan; attending both Catholic and public elementary schools; and living in a predominantly German and Irish community. He discusses his employment history, including working for the Siegel-Cooper department store in Manhattan as a messenger during school vacations; working for Jacob Ruppert &amp; Company brewery in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan; and being employed in an unspecified war production factory during World War II.  He discusses working in construction for most of his life and his wife supplementing his income by working from home as a seamstress. He recalls his  military service during WWI, including being drafted into the Army; being sent to Camp Upton on Long Island for training; and being stationed at Camp Upton for a short time before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.  Other topics regarding WWI include the increased beer tax preventing Leonard from frequenting bars for lunch; his neighbors not supporting  the United States' (US) involvement in the war until the sinking of the RMS Lusitania; and that after the war there were no jobs.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leonard discusses leisure activities within his community, including playing softball during the summer; playing basketball and football during the winter; and playing cards and craps with his neighbors.  He discusses politics in the US, including the increased support for the Nazi Party in his neighborhood because the German population believed Adolf Hitler was good for Germany; his opinion that state politicians focused on winning the votes of New York City residents because the population was large enough to determine election results; his belief that the Socialist Party of America was good for workers but that it lost influence after WWI; and that he did not view McCarthyism as a problem since it did not directly affect him or his neighbors.</field>
