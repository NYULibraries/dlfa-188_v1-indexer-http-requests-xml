    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Karen Kearns.  The date and location of this interview are unknown.  This interview covers Fanny Heltzer's childhood in Russia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and her work in the garment industry and as a private nurse in New York, New York.  Heltzer begins the interview by describing her childhood in Kiev, noting that conversations regarding politics were forbidden in school; that she acquired her socialist viewpoints from family and friends; and that she attended secret socialist meetings.  She recalls that her mother paid for her to be a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev because her sister noted the high-paying opportunities in that industry in the US.  She describes her mother sending Heltzer's oldest sister to the US in the hopes that she would eventually be able to send for the rest of the family.  She explains that her brother was sent to Siberia due to his revolutionary activity and that their mother sent him to the US in order to prevent his being arrested again.  She notes that she immigrated soon after him in 1906, with their two remaining sisters following her.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Heltzer explains that she initially lived with her sister on Houston Street in Manhattan but moved in with a friend because of her sister's overbearing rules.  She explains that she acquired her first job in a ladies' shirtwaist shop through the recommendation of a friend, noting her initial fear of the speed and noise of the electric sewing machines; that the conditions of the shop were filthy; and that she quit because of the poor conditions and the long work week.  She explains that her next jobs in Manhattan, in a dress shop and at the Nemo Corset Company, were better due to the cleaner conditions in the shops.  She notes that employees at the Nemo Corset Company were afraid to organize and join a union because of the potentially hostile reaction from management.  She emphasizes the development of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union during her time in various garment shops, noting the union's concern over working conditions and lack of job security.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Heltzer recalls joining a dramatic club where she met her husband, emphasizing her and her husband's involvement with plays and the club's choral group.  She recalls that her husband worked as a watchmaker but also had other business ventures.  Heltzer describes moving to Shelton, Connecticut during World War I and later to Worcester, Massachusetts as her husband changed jobs.  She explains that he invested in cotton goods and lost nearly all of this money in a failed business venture in Worcester, prompting the family to move back to New York City.  She describes working as a machine operator for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) through which she joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) and the Workers' Unemployed Union (WUU), established in New York City by the Socialist Party of America.  She recalls moving through various neighborhoods in New York City in order to find better employment and living conditions, focusing on her time working in her husband's jewelry store on 41st Street and 10th Avenue.  She explains that a robbery in the store affected her husband's physical and mental health, prompting her to work at the store by herself for two years before closing it.  She emphasizes her family's involvement in and bonding through the Socialist Party, noting that her children grew up around party events due to her and her husband's labor union and other party activities.  </field>
