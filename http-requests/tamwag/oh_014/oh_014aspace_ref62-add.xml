    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by David Rosenberg and Mark Hirsch on two different dates in May 1974.  The first interview was conducted by Rosenberg and Hirsch at an unknown location.  A man identified as John also contributes to the interview.  The second interview was conducted by Rosenberg at Jimmy Gavin's home in Brooklyn, New York.  The volume of the recording fluctuates throughout the interview.  This interview covers Gavin's childhood in Ireland; his involvement in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War; his immigration to the United States (US); and his work as a boatswain and an organizer for both the International Seamen's Union of America (ISU) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).  Gavin begins by explaining that he does not believe that the working class knows its own history, providing a timeline of events that he considers important to the development of the working class. He describes his childhood in Ireland, recalling his attendance at an English national school; his love of the Irish language and Irish history and literature; fishing and hunting trips; and the contrast between his father, who was a Marxist and anti-religion, and his mother, a devout Catholic.  He describes joining the Irish Republican Army (IRA); leaving home at his father's behest in order to protect his family; not having a permanent home; learning how to use a gun; switching sides various times over the course of both the the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War; and returning briefly to his home after he was declared dead. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Gavin recounts traveling through England and deciding to immigrate to the US because the English police knew him to be a member of the IRA.  He recalls writing to an aunt in the US who sent him the money to immigrate.  He explains that he initially settled in Chicago, Illinois, where he worked transferring freight from boats.  He describes his time working for the United States Coast Guard; the development of the ISU; his move to New York, New York; his contribution to organizing the Seamen's Unemployment Council in 1932; and various strikes for better conditions, particularly in terms of food quality and working hours.  Other topics include his opinions on politicians and journalists; his political views; his work dissuading strikebreakers from occupying positions that union workers had vacated while on strike; and his trips across the US to organize labor unions. </field>
