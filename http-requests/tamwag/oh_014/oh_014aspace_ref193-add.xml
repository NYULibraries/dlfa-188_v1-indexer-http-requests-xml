She recalls her early experiences in New York, including feeling lonely and homesick for the first year; being teased due to her accent; being confused about how to use money; interacting with people of different races for the first time; and finding that a majority of the people she met were nice to her because she was from Ireland.</field>

Altman and Company; her promotion to the mail order department of B.

She discusses leisure activities in which she participated, including seeing movies and Broadway shows before her marriage; having picnics at Fort George in Manhattan; attending soccer games; and taking walks with her husband every night.  She recalls her involvement with the Friends of Irish Freedom, including collecting money to support the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland; attending dances sponsored by the organization; feeling obligated to join  because she was Irish; and continuing to support the movement towards a unified Ireland even though the organization no longer existed at the time of the interview.</field>
