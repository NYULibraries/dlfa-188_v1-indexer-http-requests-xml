    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interview with Morris Brawer was conducted by Zelda Huhnenberg on March 16 and March 24, 1974 at an unknown location.  Both Brawer and Huhnenberg use Yiddish terms throughout the interview with little explanation of their meaning.  Topics include Brawer's childhood and family; his work experience; his views on unions, politics, religion, and race; and his romantic relationships.  Brawer discusses his childhood in Polish Galicia, including his father's work in real estate and the fact that he was emotionally absent from his family; the Yiddish songs his mother would sing to him; his siblings, all of whom died in World War I and World War II; and his introduction to the Zionist movement.  He discusses the anti-Semitism of the working class in Galicia; the segregation of Jews in the community; and his lack of education there.  He describes his attempts to avoid the conscription into the Polish Army, including feigning a limp and bribing doctors to say he was injured; and immigrating to Germany in 1911 and to the United States (US) in 1912.  He recalls his time in Germany, including working in a kosher grocery store; having trouble finding work because he couldn't speak German; and wasting a majority of his money on entertainment.  Brawer recalls his life shortly after his immigration to the US, including the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society assisting with his entrance into the country; and his trouble finding work because he had no skills.  He discusses working for Jewish managers in non-union restaurants; owning failed embroidery factories; and working as a salesman in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Brawer discusses his social and political ideologies, including his disagreement with the US Constitution regarding equal rights, his belief that criminal proceedings should rely on majority rule, and racist beliefs about the Black community in the US.  He recalls his enrollment in the Democratic Party despite his dislike of liberals, progressives, and Socialists, and the fact that he was not interested in politics.  He discusses his opinions on labor unions, in particular that they take advantage of consumers and employers; force workers to join if they want a job; and allow workers to be disrespectful to both employers and consumers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Brawer describes his romantic relationships with women in detail, including his first sexual experience with a friend of his mother; multiple love affairs during his teenage years in Galicia; his inability to marry his only love due to her father's disapproval; and his dislike of his wife. He recalls one of his lovers becoming pregnant and obtaining an abortion, and not wanting to be perceived as promiscuous but at the same time not feeling guilty of his extramartial affairs.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Content warning: Brawer expresses many anti-Black views throughout the interview.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Transcripts and summaries are available for March 16 and March 24 interviews. </field>
