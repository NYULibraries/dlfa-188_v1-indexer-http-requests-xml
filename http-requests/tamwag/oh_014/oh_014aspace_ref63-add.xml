    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on April 19, 1974 by Scott Weir at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan, New York.  The majority of this interview, covering the first 25 years of Amelia Geiss' life, was not recorded.  Topics covered include Geiss' relationship with her husband; her experiences during the Great Depression; racial and ethnic tensions in her community in New York, New York; and her work at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center.  Geiss spends the majority of the interview discussing her relationship with her husband, Bill, including how he was separated from his first wife when they first began their relationship; the fact that his estranged wife stalked Geiss; and the fact that she moved multiple times to escape this harassment.  She discusses her husband's work as an electrician at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.  She recalls that they survived the Great Depression due to the fact that they both were able to work. She discusses the community she lived in at the time of the interview, including how ethnic discrimination had gotten worse over time, and that the community had more problems at the time of the interview because it was no longer predominantly German.  She discusses her volunteer work at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center, including the fact that she joined so that she and her husband would not fight after they retired; her fundraising efforts; both she and her husband being recognized by New York City for their work at the Center; and her participation on the Board of Directors.</field>
