    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Nina Cobb on April 27, 1975 at an unknown location.  Leonard Currieri's wife, Rose, occasionally contributes to the interview.  This interview covers Currieri's childhood in Sciacca, Italy; his immigration to New York in 1920; and his life and work in the garment industry in Brooklyn, New York up to the time of the interview.  Currieri begins by describing his childhood and education in Italy.  He notes his family's long history in maritime trade; his father's medal of honor in recognition of his 24 years of navigation service; and his own desire to become a marine officer.  He explains that he and his mother immigrated to the US in 1920, where they settled on North Portland Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.  Currieri recounts working for different companies, including Klein Brothers and Metro Candy Company, before learning the pressing trade from his brother.  He recounts working as a presser in different factories in the garment industry, including Levine Dress Company, Henry Goldstein, Glassman and Prince, and Geoffrey Beene, before opening  his own factory.   </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Currieri recalls joining the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 89 in 1932 and organizing strikes with his brother in order to acquire better wages and working conditions.  He especially emphasizes the contrast between the ideal of the American melting pot and the reality of the discrimination he and many other immigrants faced, recalling tension among the various European nationalities that settled in Brooklyn.  He explains that the membership of some ILGWU locals consisted exclusively of a particular nationality.  He notes that union educational and social activities alleviated tension between ethnic groups.  Currieri and his wife discuss the role of women in the factories; the different jobs that they held; and the unemployment gaps that permeated their careers due to marriage and caring for their children.</field>
