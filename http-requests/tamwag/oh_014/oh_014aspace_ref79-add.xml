    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Stephen Holmes on May 3, 1973 in Brooklyn, New York.  Topics discussed include Claude Hall's childhood and education in Brooklyn, his experiences in the United States Army during World War I; his wife and children; his leisure activities; his experiences during the Great Depression; and his politics.  Hall begins by discussing his childhood in Brooklyn, including his father dying when Hall was four years old; living with his aunt, uncle, and four cousins; his mother being self employed as a music teacher; and moving to different neighborhoods within Brooklyn.  He recalls in detail his education, discussing the different public schools he attended, including Public School 158 in Manhattan, and Boys High School in Brooklyn; being involved with the debate team, as well as athletics such as baseball, football, and track; the racial integration of athletic teams and other extracurricular activities; and the lack of Black teachers.  His memories of World War I include joining the 15th New York National Guard Regiment; moving to different parts of the east coast of the United States for training; the racism he experienced while training on a base in Spartanburg, South Carolina (likely Camp Croft); fighting in the trenches in France; and receiving the Purple Heart after being wounded in Argonne, France.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hall discusses first meeting his wife when he was twelve years old; their four living children and the death of their fifth; and the ethnic diversity and racial integration in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens, where Hall and his family lived.  He mentions leisure activities such as being involved with his children's Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts troops; reading aloud with his children; and attending the theater.  He mentions that the church was the center of most of the community's social activities.  He discusses the Great Depression, including the fact that the Ozone Park neighborhood was not affected as much as other neighborhoods; that his family helped the few families in need both financially and with food; and that even those in the community who needed relief were better off than others in New York City.  He discusses politics in New York City, including the fact that his community strongly supported Fiorello La Guardia; that Woodrow Wilson was well respected; that Republican presidents after Warren G. Harding were not trusted; his opinions of the Teapot Dome Scandal; and his involvement in the Queens County Colored Democratic Organization.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Claude Hall immigrated to the United States from an unspecified country with his parents in 1902 and settled in Brooklyn, New York. After his father died when Hall was four years old, he and his mother lived with his uncle, aunt, and four cousins.  He graduated from  Public School 158 in Manhattan, and Boys High School in Brooklyn in 1915, where he was active in athletics and other extracurricular activities.  After working for a year in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, he joined the 15th New York National Guard in 1916, which was activated and joined the 369th Infantry.  While in the Army, he fought in Argonne, France and received a Purple Heart.  Hall married in 1916 and had five children, four of whom survived infancy.  He worked in multiple fields including as a United States Postal Service clerk, an elevator operator, at an Army base (likely Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn); and for a manufacturing company.</field>
