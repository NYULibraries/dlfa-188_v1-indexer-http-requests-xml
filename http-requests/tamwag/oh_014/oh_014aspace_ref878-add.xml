    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Janice Albert in 1974 at an unspecified location.  The interview covers Grace Gelo's childhood in Tunis, Tunisia; her immigration to the United States (US); her working life; her husband's union and political activity; and their children.  Gelo discusses her childhood in Tunis, including her education and her parents' backgrounds.  She provides a short history of the colonization of Tunisia and of the ethnic groups in Tunis.  She discusses her family's immigration to the US and the ethnic groups in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  She discusses her strict upbringing and rules her father imposed upon her; her courtship with her husband under these rules; and her younger sister's rebellion against the rules.  She discusses having to leave school in order to work to support her family and working as a finisher on men's clothes.  She describes the first factory in which she worked; the ethnic demographics of the workers, mainly Italian and Jewish, and the language barrier between the two groups; and her unhappiness in her work and her difficulty communicating with the Jewish workers.  She describes working conditions in the factories; her dissatisfaction with them; and her opinion that the workers were seriously mistreated.  </field>
