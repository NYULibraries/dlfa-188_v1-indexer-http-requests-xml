    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The first minute of this recording contains the beginning of an interview with Lindsey Gaetana who explains that he was born in Palermo, Italy in 1885 and immigrated to the United States (US) in 1905.  The rest of the recording contains the interview with Mr. Caravello.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Bau Morrow at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home in the Bronx, New York on May 4, 1973.  The first name of the narrator is unknown.  Mr. Caravello is sometimes hard to understand due to his Italian accent.  The interview covers his working life in Italy and the United States (US).  Caravello discusses working with his father and older brother in a vineyard in Italy and grafting vines from France onto native vines.  He explains that a disease killed off the majority of the vines before his immigration to the US, but does not say whether this led to his decision to immigrate.  He explains that his father was the foreman of the vineyard; that a director and inspector would come from Rome every two weeks to oversee their work; and that they arranged for Caravello to attend high school.  He recounts his achievements in school proudly.  He discusses the fact that he immigrated to the US in order to work in vineyards in California but that his family and a good job in a nickel-plating factory kept him in New York City.  He recounts moving with his wife and baby to Madison, Wisconsin after five or six years in New York and working as a machinist.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include the nursing home at which Caravello lived at the time of the interview and the care he received; his mother's sense of style; and his siblings' lives after his immigration.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mr. Caravello was born in Italy and was one of five children.  He attended high school and worked in a vineyard with his father and one of his brothers.
