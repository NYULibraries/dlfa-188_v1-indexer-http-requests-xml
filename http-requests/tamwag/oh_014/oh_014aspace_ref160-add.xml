    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Jon Saul at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home in the Bronx, New York on March 26, 1973.  The audio recording for this interview is missing.  This interview covers Becky Prescant's childhood in Poland; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1912; and her work and union activity in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Prescant describes her hometown in Poland, noting that although there was no open hostility between the Jewish people and other religious populations, the local school did not accept Jewish students.  She recalls learning Hebrew at a Jewish school; learning how to sew at a local tailor shop; and working on the family farm.  She explains that she chose to immigrate to the US because there were no Jewish men for her to marry and no doctors in her town.  She mentions that some of her other siblings emigrated in order to avoid being drafted into the Russian Army or being persecuted for their belief in socialism.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Prescant describes immigrating to the US and settling in New York, New York in 1912, including how she pretended to be the daughter of another woman in order to leave Poland.  She describes her initial surprise at the differences between Poland and the US, particularly in terms of architecture and food.  She discusses her husband, including how they met and his death 12 years after their marriage.  She describes her first job in a garment shop on the west side of Manhattan; the differences between garment shops in Poland and the US; and the brutal conditions in the shop in which she worked.  She recounts her involvement in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU); a four month strike in which she participated for better working conditions; and the tension between the strikers and the police.  Other topics include the importance of religion to her family; the education and occupations of her children; and a comparison of both the ILGWU and her neighborhood in the past and at the time of the interview. </field>
