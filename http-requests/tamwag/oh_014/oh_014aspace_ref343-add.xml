    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on April 26, 1974.  The location and interviewer are unknown.  An unidentified man interjects comments throughout John Duffy's interview.  This interview covers Duffy's childhood in Ireland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1929; and his life and work in the retail and transportation industries in New York, New York.  Duffy begins by describing his hometown of Dundalk, Ireland, emphasizing the town's position as a thriving railroad junction and its various industries including shoe and tobacco manufacturing (specifically P.J. Carroll &amp; Company Limited).  He recalls the railroad being the major source of commerce and both his father and his grandfather working on the railroad.  He describes patterns of Irish immigration to the US, noting that many of the immigrants came from the western and southern towns in Ireland; that the Irish did not often immigrate as a family unit; the effects of religious and political conflicts on immigration; and the often contentious relationship between the Irish people and the English authorities.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Duffy describes immigrating to the US in June 1929 via the SS Leviathan, noting that he was able to bypass Ellis Island, New York due to his immigration paperwork being processed by the consulate in Dublin.  He explains that he immigrated because he had a desire to travel and he recounts living with an uncle before moving to a boarding house on East 49th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.  He focuses on his work in the supply department at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan, emphasizing the mistreatment of workers in other departments in the store; the lack of job security; and the lack of stable promotion tracks for workers.  He explains that all of these factors contributed to the union organization of retail workers in the store, specifically through Local 65 of an unspecified retail workers' union (likely the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union).  He emphasizes the fragility of the early years of the union, describing tension among members when Bloomingdale's gave the workers a raise and had the union disperse the raises from a lump sum.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Duffy recalls leaving Bloomingdale's in 1943 and becoming a transportation worker and joining the Transport Workers Union of America.  He emphasizes the union's slow organizational growth over the course of the 1940s and 1950s; the conflict between communist and non-communist factions in the union; and the way in which the union's president, Michael Quill, dealt with the communists' attempts to gain power.  Other topics include religious, ethnic, and racial divisions in the workforce, particularly in the retail industry, and the negative relationship between Duffy's parish church and the Communist Party of the United States of America.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">John Duffy was born in an unspecified town in Ireland and grew up in the town of Dundalk.  He had two brothers and two sisters.  His father worked as an engine driver on the railroad and was a member of an unspecified railroad workers' union.

He attended Washington Irving High School in the Union Square neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and lived in a boarding house on East 49th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.  Duffy began working in the supply department of Bloomingdale's in 1929 and remained there until 1943 when he became a transportation worker.  He was an active member and elected official of Local 65 of an unspecified retail workers' union (likely the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union) and was later a member of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU).</field>
