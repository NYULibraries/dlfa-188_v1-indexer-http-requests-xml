    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Mark Hirsh on April 24, 1973 at Regina Mansberg's home in the Bronx, New York. The interview covers Mansberg's early life in Galicia, Austria-Hungary; her separation from her family during World War I; her life in Europe after the war; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life in New York City up to the 1930s. Topics from her early life include her family's poverty; her difficult relationship with her stepmother; her affection for her father and her sorrow when he was unable to earn enough wages to support the family; and her education. Mansberg's memories of World War I include fleeing from Cossacks with her family; running away on her own toCzechoslovakia, where she worked on a farm; and her reunion with her family after the war. She recounts meeting her future husband, Morris Mansberg, and moving with him to Budapest; learning about communism; and her decision to emigrate from Austria-Hungary in 1921 after Mikl√≥s Horthy came to power.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In discussing her life after her immigration, Mansberg recounts her disappointment in her aunt's apartment on Avenue C in Manhattan, New York; her uncomfortable sleeping arrangements; and her overall unhappiness with her life and work. She discusses her working life, including working with other Jewish women, mainly Hungarians and Poles; moving to different parts of the city and commuting to Manhattan for work; returning to work outside of the home after the birth of each of her children; and striking for better working conditions at different union and non-union shops. Other topics include her husband's disappointment in having no employment options apart from manual labor in the US; the family's struggles with poverty; and their eldest son's treatments for poliomyelitis.</field>
