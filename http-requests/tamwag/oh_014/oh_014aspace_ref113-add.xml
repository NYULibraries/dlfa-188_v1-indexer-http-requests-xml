    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on March 18, 1975 by Frank Farragaso at the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York.  The interview covers Rose Lapidus' early life in Russia and her working life.  Lapidus discusses her early life in a small town near Minsk, Russia, including anti-Semitism there and different jobs she held as a child and young woman.  She discusses her immigration to the United States (US).  She describes her first few jobs in garment factories in the US and the reasons she lost them, attributing these losses to the fact that the factories were non-union.  She recounts working after her marriage and up until a few weeks before the birth of her son.  She discusses not working in one place for too long; finding jobs through friends or agencies; preferring to be paid a salary rather than for piecework; and taking in work at home while her son was young.  She describes the physical conditions in union and non-union factories and the benefits to working in union factories.  She describes her work as a machine operator and the work of the finishers and pressers in the garment factories.</field>
