    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by John Jentz on March 3, 1975 at the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York. Topics include Goldie Leos' childhood in Russia; her education; her immigration to the United States (US) and first experiences in New York, New York; her marriage; her work experiences; and her views on religion. Leos discusses her childhood in Russia, including the fact that her family ran a business selling animal hides; that her father was a scholar while her mother controlled the household and business; and that she supported the family after her mother died by selling homemade candy to local businesses. She recalls her father remarrying; disliking her stepmother; the family moving to Baranovichi, Russia from Lychkovtse, Russia after her father remarried; and resenting having to continue supporting the family after they relocated. She discusses her education, including being one of only eight Jewish girls in Lychkovtse to learn Hebrew; learning Yiddish and Russian; receiving private tutoring because there was no public education for Jewish people; and feeling frustrated that she was not taught skills she could use in the workforce.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leos discusses her immigration to the US through Ellis Island in 1916, including having no immediate relatives to help support her after she arrived and feeling frustrated that she often needed to depend on distant relatives for financial support. She recalls meeting her husband in Russia and becoming reacquainted with him shortly after her arrival in the US; deciding to marry him after he cared for her during an illness; supporting him financially by taking in boarders; and rarely being apart from him until his death in the 1950s. She discusses her work experiences including sewing buttons onto children's clothing; folding nightgowns in an unnamed factory; and managing a stationery store in the Bronx with her husband.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leos discusses her belief that Hasidim were the happiest members of their faith; her opinion that religion strengthened her relationship with her family; and her involvement with the Zionist movement.</field>
