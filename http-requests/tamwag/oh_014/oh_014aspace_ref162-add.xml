    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Norman Newman on April 11, 1973 at an unknown location.  Tina Quartaroni is hard to understand due to her heavy accent and distance from the microphone.  This interview covers Quartaroni's life in the United States (US) and the many jobs she held in the Bronx, New York.  She describes her first few occupations briefly, noting that she transitioned from dressmaking to packaging Christmas tree lights before she found stable work in a laundry.  She recounts joining an unspecified laundry workers' union but notes that they didn't strike, and conditions improved after the business was sold.  She also describes her husband, including the fact that he rarely worked; his dependence on her income and pension; and their separation when she tired of his idleness and gambling.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Quartaroni emphasizes the differences between American and Italian Catholic churches, noting that Italian churches tended to be elaborately decorated; that the Italian church fostered a tightly-knit community; and that few people regularly attended Mass in the US.</field>
