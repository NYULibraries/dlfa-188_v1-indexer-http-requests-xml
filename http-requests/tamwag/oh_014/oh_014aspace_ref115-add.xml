    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Frank Farragaso at Rebecca Leff's home in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York on an unspecified date.  The interview covers Leff's early life in Russia, her family, her working life, and her union activity.  Leff discusses her childhood in a small town near Brest-Litovsk, Russia, including skirmishes in her town during World War I and the Russian Revolution.  She describes her family's immigration to the United States; her father's immigration in 1912 and the other family members' immigrations in 1920; and difficulties they faced in acquiring visas.  She discusses attending school for two years in Brooklyn, New York before leaving to find work.  She discusses wanting to work in the garment industry because she wanted to learn how to sew in order to be able to make her own clothes and because she was fascinated by sewing machines.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leff discusses her decision to join the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) after being pressured to do so by the chairlady at her factory.

She describes her union activity, including the different locals to which she belonged; her willingness to participate in organizing and education events; and her election as a delegate to the ILGWU's national conventions in 1932 and 1934.  Other topics include conditions for garment workers during the Great Depression; her off-season work on dolls' dresses; and her life at the time of the interview, including her volunteer work as a friendly visitor to retired ILGWU members in nursing homes.</field>
