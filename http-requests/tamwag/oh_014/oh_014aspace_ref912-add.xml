    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Howard Harris on February 24 and March 17, 1975 at the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York.  Topics include Lena Kimberg's life in Russia; her family's immigration to the United States (US); the work experiences of her and her family members; her education; and leisure activities in which she participated.  She discusses her family's employment in Russia, including her father working as a foreman for a lumber company; one uncle being apprenticed to a tailor; another uncle studying in a yeshiva; and her mother caring for the home and the children.  She recalls her family's immigration, including her father's immigration two years before hers; her family's reliance on the money he sent; her immigration with other family members when she was nine years old; and the eventual immigration of her entire immediate family.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Kimberg recalls her work experiences, including making bows and flowers for hats at thirteen years old, and receiving an official work permit when she was fourteen years old.  She recounts starting work as a milliner at two dollars and fifty cents a week; receiving a raise to eight dollars by the end of her first year; becoming a foreman at the age of 17; and leaving her job when she married.  She discusses her family's employment in the US, including her father working in a men's clothing factory; her uncles' opening a garment shop a year after they immigrated; and her older brother being employed as a cutter in the garment industry. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Kimberg discusses her mother teaching her Hebrew; learning English from other Jewish immigrants in her neighborhood; wanting to attend high school but having to work instead; and having to quit night school because she was too tired.  She recalls the importance of education for boys in Russia, specifically that they were taught Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian.  She discussed the fact that she and her older brother saved money in order to send her younger brother to Woods Secretarial School in Manhattan rather than furthering their own education. She discusses leisure activities, in particular creating a social club with other neighborhood couples and spending time outside of work with the women she supervised.</field>
