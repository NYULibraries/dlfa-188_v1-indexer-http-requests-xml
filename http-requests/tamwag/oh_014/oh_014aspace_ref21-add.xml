    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted  by Shirley Stow on April 26, 1974 at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan, New York.  This interview covers Ernestine Brown's childhood in St. George, South Carolina; her migration to New York, New York; and her life and work as family nurse in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Brown discusses her childhood on a large plantation in St. George, where she helped grow and harvest peas, corn, cotton, and tobacco.  She notes that the plantation, granted to the family by the federal government due to her grandmother's Cherokee heritage, spread for miles and isolated them from the surrounding communities.  She explains that in order to keep the plantation self-sufficient, many of her family members assumed various roles within the community, with one of her cousins working as the schoolteacher and her great uncle and father working as preachers in the local church.  She discusses her grandmother's role as the matriarch of the family.  She recounts her move to Charleston, South Carolina, mentioning that she had never interacted with a white person before arriving in the city.  She focuses on the stifled interactions between the racial groups in the city, describing the influence of the Jim Crow laws; and the intense scrutiny that Black residents faced from white police officers.  She describes the differences between the schools in St. George and in Charleston.    </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Brown describes her move to New York City, where she was reunited with her husband. She discusses her initial impressions of New York City, conveying the security she felt in living there through anecdotes about sleeping on the roof and fire escapes, and keeping her door open at night. Brown recalls how her husband found work through a Civilian Conservation Corps camp, which resulted in his Army service during World War II. She discusses being concerned that her husband would be affected by what would now be called post-traumatic stress disorder. Brown emphasizes the changes in Harlem as a strong black community developed in the wake of white flight. She spends a considerable amount of time noting the differences among the churches in St. George, Charleston, and Harlem, noting that St. George's preachers focused more on serving the community and the preachers in Charleston and Harlem focused on more secular matters. Brown later describes her husband's brief, but serious illness, which resulted in multiple hospital visits before he died at home.</field>
