    <field name="scopecontent_teim">There are two interviews with Bruno Canossa.  For the first interview, the interviewer, location, and date are unknown.  Topics include Canossa's immigration to the United States (US), the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1814, his family life, and leisure activities that he participated in.  Canossa discusses his immigration to the US in 1923, including not returning to his ship when it made port; immigrating alone because his immigration was not planned in advance; and feeling glad that he immigrated to the US.  He discusses the ILA, including the fact that there was always a union on the waterfront; that there were no requirements for joining other than paying dues; and that union benefits did not begin until after World War II.  He recalls marrying an American woman; having four children; and the fact that he was married for 42 years at the time of the interview.  He discusses leisure activities he enjoyed, such as reading the Daily Mirror and an unspecified Italian newspaper; attending the opera; and traveling to upstate New York and Long Island for vacations.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The second interview was conducted on March 18, 1975 at the Carroll Park Senior Center on Court Street in Brooklyn, New York by John Jentz, Jay Facciolo, and Frank Faragasso.  Bruno Canossa was assisted by Mario Cinisomo, who helps Canossa explain his thoughts.  Topics include Canossa's childhood, his immigration to the United States (US), his working experience, and his labor union involvement.  Canossa recollects his early life in Italy, including his father working in the engine room on ships in a Navy yard and that his family had a comfortable living.  His early memories of New York, New York include jumping ship when the boat he worked on arrived in port; getting his first job through friends he met in New York City; having multiple roommates in order to save money; and learning English in night school.  Despite the fact that he immigrated on a whim, he did not consider immigrating to New York City a mistake.  He discusses socializing predominantly with members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the Catholic Church; and frequenting cafes to spend time with other Italian immigrants.  He also discusses the differences between New York City in the 1920s and at the time of the interview, including money going farther and people acting respectfully.  He explains that he joined the ILA because he could not work without being in the union, and that union benefits did not start until after World War II.  He discusses working on long term projects out of state; and that longshoremen did not want their children to become longshoremen unless they were not good students.</field>
