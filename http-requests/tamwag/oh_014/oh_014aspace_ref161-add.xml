    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Scott Weir at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan, New York on April 23, 1974.  This interview covers Albert Preuhs' childhood and early adult life in Germany; his immigration to the United States (US); and a summary of his life in New York, New York.  Preuhs begins by describing his father's work in a bakery in Hamburg, Germany, noting his membership in a local union and his progression from employee to manager of his own business. He describes working as an apprentice for three years before traveling to various German cities during his time as a journeyman.  Preuhs explains that he joined the German merchant marine in order to travel and was subsequently drafted into the German Navy in 1906, serving on a warship stationed in Hamburg.  Upon his discharge from the Navy, he acquired a position on a merchant ship and jumped ship in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1911.  He describes settling in the Beggars' Boarding House on 5th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, noting the ease with which he found work due to the myriad of small German bakeries in the city.  He explains that he worked in many of these bakeries in different parts of the city and moved often in order to live near or in his current workplace.  Other topics from his life in the US include the seasonal nature of the baking industry; his time working in Chicago, Illinois; and the development of technology in the baking industry and its role in the obsolescence of many physical laborers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Albert Preuhs was born in Hamburg, Germany on September 3, 1886.  His father worked as a baker, eventually owning his own bakery.  His mother worked in a kitchen for the city of Hamburg during an unspecified war but otherwise did not work outside the home.   He attended school in Germany for eight years before moving into the workforce as a baker when he was 18 years old, joining a bakers' union in Hamburg.  Preuhs served in the German merchant marine and the German Navy before he immigrated to the United States (US) in January 1911.  He lived in the Beggars' Boarding House on 5th Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York before getting his own apartment.  He worked as a baker and joined an unspecified bakers' union in New York (likely the Journeymen Bakers Union of New York).</field>
