    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by John Jentz at the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York on March 13, 1975. The interview covers Anna Herzog's life in Minsk, Russia, her immigration to the United States (US), her involvement in union activities and strikes, and her personal life. Herzog recollects her early life in Minsk, including her father dying when she was three years old; her brother serving as a father figure; Jewish children not being allowed to attend school; wanting to play instead of work; and working for a year in a garment factory on a pedal sewing machine.  Her first memories of New York, New York include learning English through friends, and being overwhelmed with the size of New York City.  She remembers needing to supply her own sewing machine at her first job; and requiring assistance carrying the sewing machine up and down the stairs.  She recalls the differences between garment work in Russia and the United States.  She recalls a strike in 1911, during which the workers went on strike for 15 days in order to achieve better pay, better working conditions, and for owner-supplied sewing machines.  Herzog's discussion of her personal life includes meeting her husband and their wedding in Toronto, Canada; having two sons and adopting her sister's daughter; discontinuing work because she was pregnant; and moving to the Workmen's Circle Home against her son's wishes.</field>
