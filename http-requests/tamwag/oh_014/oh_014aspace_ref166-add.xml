    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Ron Walker on April 20, 1973 at an unknown location.  The first name of the narrator is unknown.  The interviews covers Mr. Remier's migration from Georgia to New York, New York; his social life; his experience of racial discrimination in New York; and his working life.  Remier describes social activities in which he and wife participated in New York City, including a social and benevolent organization named the Georgia Association.  He recounts the ease with which he and his family settled in New York, due in part to his wife having family there.
