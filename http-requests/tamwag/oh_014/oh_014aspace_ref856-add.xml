    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on April 28, 1973 by Joan Granucci at an unspecified location. The interview covers Caroline Lavecchia Cappeletti's childhood in Italy, her parents' immigration to the United States (US), her marriage, her extended family, and her social life. Cappeletti discusses her childhood, including her parents' immigration to the US; her life in Italy with her grandfather; and her immigration to the US after his death. She describes being introduced to her husband and having to meet him secretly because of the strict rules her father set for her behavior. She describes the buildings and people in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, including the fact that few Italians lived there. She discusses her work in a dress factory; modeling dress samples while the manager altered them; and sewing buttons by hand and other pieces on sewing machines. She also discusses her salary and the fact that the factory was not unionized. She describes her living situation after her marriage: she and her husband lived with his four brothers and their wives, and the group bought two apartment houses. She discusses financial difficulties they had and the fact that all of the women had to work outside of the home in order for the group to afford the mortgage payments on the buildings. She discusses her social life before and during her marriage, including taking boat trips along the Hudson River and dancing at the Roseland Ballroom.</field>
