    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sylvia Feldstein was born in Russia in 1896 and graduated from a secondary school in Odessa in 1914.  She emigrated from Russia with her mother and some of her siblings in the 1920s.  She lived in Paris, France between 1921 and 1930 and worked as a cap maker.  She met her husband and gave birth to their first son in Paris.  The family immigrated to the United States in 1930 and settled in New York, New York.  They lived in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan and the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Her second child was born in the 1930s.  After her elder son enlisted in the United States Navy in 1945, she returned to work as a machine operator in garment factories.  She was a member of an unspecified union (likely the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America or the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union).  Her husband worked as a printer and was a member of an unspecified printers' union (likely the International Typographical Union).</field>
