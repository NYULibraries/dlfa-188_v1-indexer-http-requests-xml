    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Victor Scheluchin on April 16, 1973 at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens on 125th Street in Manhattan, New York. The first name of the narrator is unknown.  Topics of discussion include Mr. Jackson's childhood and family; social activities in New York, New York; Prohibition; and his work experience.  Jackson recalls his childhood, including having a small family with step-siblings; being forced to attend church by his mother; playing shortstop for his school baseball team and French horn in the school band; and leaving school to work as a golf caddy.  He migrated to New York City because he wanted adventure and enjoyed traveling.  He speaks about his work in multiple hotels in New York State and New Jersey; leaving hotel work to be a cook on a dining car; and working as a porter for the National Biscuit Company until 1966.  He discusses his personal and social life, including meeting his first wife while working in a hotel in New York and meeting his second wife in Florida and traveling around the United States with her.  He also mentions enjoying dancing but being disinclined to touch his partner; buying whiskey in Atlantic City, New Jersey for five dollars a quart during Prohibition; and attending racially integrated nightclubs.</field>
