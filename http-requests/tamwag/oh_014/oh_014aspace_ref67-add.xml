    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on April 24, 1973 by Victor Scheluchin at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens, on 125th Street in Manhattan, New York. The main topics discussed include Rose Godet's childhood in the Dominican Republic, her feelings about immigrating to the United States (US), her work experience, and her personal experiences in New York, New York. Godet begins by discussing her early life in the Dominican Republic, including being of French descent; speaking multiple languages; and her father working for the Puccini Shipping Company. Her early experiences in New York City include living on 140th Street in Manhattan; deciding to only live in Manhattan; disliking living in the US initially because she had never worked before; feeling lonely in the city; and finding the US to be substantially more expensive than the Dominican Republic. Godet discusses her confusion regarding segregation. She discusses her personal experiences during the Prohibition era and the Great Depression, including an Irish friend giving her bootleg liquor, though she did not like the taste; enjoying visiting speakeasies; and being employed pressing silk underwear. She talks about World War II and her fear of air raid drills; that minimum wage requirements implemented by Franklin D. Roosevelt were not enforced; and her belief that the US government would pull men off the streets and force them into the military. She notes her work experience, which included working as a saleswoman and interpreter for the Charles Broadway Rouss department store on Broadway in Manhattan and learning to type in order to work for a mail order company translating orders received in Spanish or French. She discusses her employment at the National Biscuit Company packing cookies after she began to lose her eyesight, and feeling exploited by the company due to the minimal vacation time, long hours, and low wages.</field>
