    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Scott Weir on April 22, 1974 at the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center in Manhattan, New York.  Main topics include Vera Koch's childhood; her immigration to the United States (US); her experiences during the Great Depression and World War II; and her work experiences.  She recalls her childhood in Hungary, including working on her family's farm during World War I (WWI); her town being isolated from the war; her father immigrating to the US with her older sister and returning to Hungary after WWI; and meeting her future husband at a church function. Her memories of the immigration process include spending a week in Hamburg, Germany; not associating with people who did not speak Hungarian; getting extra food because a friend could speak English with the sailors; and having to stay on the ship at Ellis Island for an extra night after her arrival.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Koch recalls leisure activities such as dancing the Charleston at clubs on 86th Street in Manhattan; listening to German music; coffee klatches with other women in the neighborhood; and having picnics in the parks during the summer.  She discusses her experiences during the Great Depression and World War II (WWII), including having enough money to support her family because of her husband's tailoring shop; most people working two or three days a week and not being able to support their families; rationing; and being able to save money during WWII.  She discusses her work experience, including being a live-in maid, nanny, and companion in Yonkers, New York for seven years before she married and had children; moving to Manhattan and working as a maid at the Hampshire House Hotel after her husband died; and participating in the Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees International Union Local 6.</field>
