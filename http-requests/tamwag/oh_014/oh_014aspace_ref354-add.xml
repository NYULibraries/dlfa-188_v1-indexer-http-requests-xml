    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Edmund Lake.  The location and date of this interview are unknown.  The first portion of this interview is missing.  Main topics include Ruth Sinclar's son, her employment in a sweater factory and as a Sunday school teacher, and her church attendance. Sinclar discusses her son, including his moves to Phoenix, Arizona and Maine in an attempt to control his asthma; his graduation from the University of Maine and Howard University School of Law in Washington DC;  his decision to leave Harvard Law School for Howard University; his passing the bar exam in 1961; and his work for a Pacific Line train between attending Harvard and Howard.  She discusses working in a sweater factory on Broadway in Manhattan, New York; teaching Sunday school at Mount Olivet Baptist Church and Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan; and participating in the Parent Teacher Association of her son's school.  She discusses the different churches she attended, including joining Mount Olivet Baptist Church in 1933; joining Abyssinian Baptist Church in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in 1948, but disliking it because Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. spent more time in Washington, DC than Harlem; and joining Calvary Baptist Church in 1963, where she was still a member at the time of the interview.</field>
