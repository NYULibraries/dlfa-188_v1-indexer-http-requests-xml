    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Gigi, whose last name is unknown, on May 2, 1974. The location is likely Mozelle Smith's apartment. Gigi often provides long anecdotes of her own. This interview covers Smith's childhood in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York; her education; her work in domestic service; part of her mother's life in Chesterfield County, Virginia; a discussion between herself and Gigi about religion; and Smith's musings on how New York City and its inhabitants have changed since her childhood.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Smith begins the interview by recounting how she received her nickname, Mozelle, in school and how the name has stayed with her. She describes growing up in Harlem and specifically focuses on living in racially mixed areas, both on 125th Street and 127th Street. She explains the impact this had on her education experience, noting that the first school she attended, Public School (PS) 43, was a predominantly white school, where the teachers treated her well, but she often fought with other students when they called her racial slurs. She recalls that when she transferred to PS 157, she expected to be treated fairly because there were more Black students, but they ostracized her because she lived in a white neighborhood, which prompted fights with them. Smith recounts her mother not understanding her aggressive reaction to racial slurs and attributes this to her being accustomed to such treatment due to growing up in Virginia. She recounts her mother's time in Virginia and her experience migrating to New York; her mother's job as a chambermaid near Columbia University in Manhattan; issues of colorism in the Black community; and her experience at church and Sunday school.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Smith and Gigi have a long discussion concerning religion, covering topics such as the difference in the way the Black community and others practice religion; whether such a delineation should exist; changes in the importance of religion for both groups; and the impact of slavery and African traditions on the development of Black spirituality. Other topics include Smith's musings on changes in New York City since her childhood; Spanish becoming as important a language as English in the United States at the time of the interview; her decision not to have children with her husband; and comparing the connotations of being referred to as Black or Negro.</field>
