    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Shirley Stow on April 1, 1974 at an unknown location.  This interview covers William Thompson's childhood in Florida; his experience in the Army during World War I; his migration to New York, New York; his work as a porter for the Pullman Palace Car Company; and his volunteer work at the time of the interview.  Thompson begins with a summary of his childhood in Florida, including living with his aunt after his mother died; picking beans on his aunt's farm; playing baseball, swimming, and fishing during his leisure time; and going to church and Sunday school.  He recalls acquiring a job on a freight train when he was 17 years old and being drafted into the Army during World War I.  He explains that although his particular battalion did not experience racial discrimination, Black soldiers in other regiments reported such treatment.  He recounts being discharged from the Army in 1919 and settling in Boston, noting few Black residents in the area.   He describes migrating to New York, New York on September 3, 1923 and finding work unloading goods from ships for two years.  </field>
