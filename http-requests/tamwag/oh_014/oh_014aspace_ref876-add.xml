    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Mark Hirsch on July 3, 1973 at Abe Fox's home. Fox's accent, his tendency to mumble, and the fluctuation of volume over the course of the interview make him hard to understand. The interview covers Fox's childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and his work in the garment industry in New York, New York. Fox begins the interview by describing his childhood in Russia, focusing on anti-Semitism in his hometown, which included pogroms and abuse by the police. He recounts not being paid during the three years of his tailoring apprenticeship and receiving meager pay for his long hours of work after his apprenticeship. He recounts the Socialist Revolutionary Party meeting at his house and learning more about Socialism at the library until his library card was destroyed when it was learned that he was Jewish.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Fox explains that he immigrated to the US in 1906 after several failed attempts to cross the border into Austria without travel documents in order to sail from a port in Poland. He discusses living with his aunt's family on the East Side of Manhattan, recalling his acclimation to the spring weather and the low cost of food in New York City. He describes his first job in a garment shop in New York City and explains that, in the beginning, he had to bring his own machine to work. He notes that although he joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 23 in order to fight for better wages, hours, and working conditions, change was slow due to factions within the union and corruption among the union leaders. He recalls a strike that occurred in the early 1950s, through which workers acquired a twenty percent wage increase despite conflicts with strikebreakers brought in from Chicago, Illinois. He discusses the ILGWU opening a school to train machine operators and the union becoming more inclusive, particularly in terms of the Italian population's involvement. He explains that different skill levels and job types had different wage standards in the union and discusses working conditions in the garment shops. He recounts that he established a ready-made garment store on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn with his brother and step-father, noting that the people paid to guard the store broke in and stole all the merchandise.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include a comparison of his impression of the US before and after his immigration; his tumultuous relationships with his father and step-father; his lack of knowledge regarding pregnancy and sex prior to his marriage; his leisure activities, including reading the newspaper, playing pinochle, and attending shows at the Jewish theater; and his views on the birth control movement, the rise of political power among the Cuban and Black populations, and the migration of Jewish people to the suburbs.</field>
