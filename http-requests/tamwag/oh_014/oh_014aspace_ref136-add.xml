    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by John Jenks and Frank Farragaso at the International Longshoremen's Association Union Hall on Court Street in Brooklyn, New York on an unknown date.  This interview covers Giuseppe Massa's childhood; his work experience; his union involvement; and his leisure activities in New York, New York. Massa recalls a rough upbringing in Italy, including making less than 50 Lire in a good week; being punished physically by his mother if he didn't behave; gaining longshoreman experience working on a boat; and coming to the United States in order to have a better life.  He discussed injuries he sustained while working as a longshoreman, including falling down a flight of stairs and injuring his back, and receiving $600 in compensation for the loss of part of his finger.  He briefly mentions his involvement with the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814, in particular reluctantly participating in strikes, and wishing the union would help him in his old age, particularly with his medical bills.  Massa discusses social activities such as playing billiards; attending church; and believing that younger generations do not know how to live as a community.</field>
