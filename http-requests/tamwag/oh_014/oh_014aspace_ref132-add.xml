    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewer, date, location, and first name of the interviewee are unknown.  The audio recording for this interview is missing.  This interview covers Mrs. Manar's life in Puerto Rico; her migration to the United States (US) in 1945; and her acclimation to life in the US.  She describes dreaming about living in the US, noting the freedom of speech and greater economic opportunity as her main reasons for wanting to migrate.  She explains that her husband had been a teacher in Puerto Rico but worked as a clerk at the Metropolitan Hospital in the East Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York after their migration.  She recounts her family's Americanization, noting that although they retained some of the culinary traditions of Puerto Rico, they changed the majority of their customs, in particular their language.  She explains that the neighborhoods surrounding both 110th Street and 103rd Street were bad, recalling gang and drug activity, but notes that neither of these issues prevented her children from thriving.  She describes city funded programs and Catholic charities that would take the children on trips and leisure activities at beaches, parks, and the movies.  She recounts instances of discrimination against her and her children and the relationships among different ethnic groups in the neighborhoods in which she lived.</field>
