    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewer, location, and date of this interview are unknown. This interview was conducted in Italian with the aid of a translator who is often hard to hear.  Topics include Schiano's life in Italy, his family, work as a longshoreman, and leisure activities. Schiano discusses his early life in Italy including having eight siblings; marrying and having children; and working as a sailor.  He remembers immigrating to the United States (US) twice: once on his own and then again with his wife and children. He discusses leisure activities in Brooklyn, New York, including trips to Prospect Park, museums, and Coney Island; reading only Italian newspapers; and listening to Italian music, but not Italian opera. He discusses feeling grateful for the opportunities in the US  and identifying as a Democrat.  Other topics include being a member of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1814; finding employment through friends; and working on the docks because he no longer wanted to go out to sea.  He speaks at length about his children, including how they spoke to him in Italian while they spoke English amongst themselves; that he supported them until they married so that they would have savings; and his insistence that they attend school rather than work.  He specifically describes feeling proud of his son for attending college.</field>
