    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Rona Weiss on March 28, 1973 at the headquarters of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 22 in Manhattan, New York. The interview covers Evadni Richards' early life in Jamaica, her immigration to the United States (US), her work in the garment industry, and her union activity.  Richards discusses her early life in Jamaica, including her education at a dressmaking school in Kingston and her decision to immigrate to Cuba with a friend.  She discusses working as a domestic worker and companion in Cuba before immigrating to the US in 1922.  She discusses her brother's business as a shoemaker in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan and his illness, which led to his return to Jamaica in 1924 and left her alone in the US.  She discusses her work in the garment industry, including her wages; her work in the designing room doing handwork; and the other West Indians who worked in the factory with her.  She compares Jamaica and New York from her childhood and the 1920s, in particular that there was no segregation in schools or churches; the influence of colonialism in the workplace; and that wages were better in New York, despite still being relatively little.  She discusses discrimination in the garment industry; her opinion that all workers, regardless of race or ethnicity, faced a certain amount of discrimination; and racial discrimination she faced in the garment industry, in particular not being allowed to work as a designer despite her training.  She recounts being chosen to learn to operate a special sewing machine despite being the only Black worker in the factory.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Richards discusses early organizing attempts of the ILGWU in the early 1930s; her participation in strikes before she was a member of the union; and the differences in pay and working conditions after she joined the union.  She discusses cultural programs organized by the ILGWU, in particular Fannia Cohn and her Know Your City program; an orchestra and dance troupe organized by the union; the popularity of these programs with the general public; her participation in the chorus; and the participation of the chorus and orchestra in the 1939-1940 New York World's Fair.  She discusses the union's abandonment of funding of these programs in 1946 in favor of their cooperative housing programs.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include Richards' attendance at a singing school in the Bronx and her membership in an opera troupe; the immigration of her siblings to various countries; her decision to not become a US citizen until after her husband's death in 1966; her childhood in the interior of Jamaica; and her relationships with her extended family.</field>
