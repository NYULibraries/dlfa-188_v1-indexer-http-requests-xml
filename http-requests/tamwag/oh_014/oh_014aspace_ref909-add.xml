    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Joan Granucci and Martin Lesser on April 12, 1973 at James Ippolito's house in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens, New York.  Ippolito's wife, Stephanie, participates in the interview.  The interview covers Ippolito's immigration to the United States (US), his family, his working life, his union activity, his social activities, and his political affiliation.  Ippolito discusses his family's staggered immigration to the US; his father's immigration seven years before the rest of the family; and his father's work to bring the rest of the family to the US.  He discusses leaving school to join the workforce; working in a bed factory and being told he was too young for that type of work; and finding a job in the furniture industry through a friend.  He recounts joining the United Furniture Workers of America Local 76; participating in strikes; and losing a job as a result of one of the strikes.  He recounts working in a factory producing radio and television cabinets; switching to war production during World War II and making uniforms for the United States Army; and returning to production of television and radio cabinets after the war.  He lists furniture plants in which he worked; the dates of his employment; and the types of furniture each produced.  Ippolito and his wife describe the changes in the ethnic composition of the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn between the early 20th century and in the 1960s when they decided to move to Ridgewood.  He lists social clubs to which belonged, including the Happy Hearts, and discusses support provided to the poor by the Democratic Party.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">James Ippolito was born in a small town in Sicily, Italy in 1910.  He immigrated to the United States (US) in 1919 with his mother and two siblings.  His father had immigrated to the US in 1912 and worked as a food peddler.  The family lived in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.  Ippolito attended school through the eighth grade.  He worked in a bed factory in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn for a few years before getting a job in a furniture factory.  He spent the bulk of his career in the furniture industry.  He was a member of the United Furniture Workers of America (UFWA) Local 76 and was a shop steward in different factories between 1937-1965.  He was a member of unspecified joint and executive boards and a trustee (the latter two likely UFWA Local 76).  He married Stephanie Ippolito in 1936, with whom he had two sons.  In 1962, the family moved from Williamsburg to the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens.</field>
