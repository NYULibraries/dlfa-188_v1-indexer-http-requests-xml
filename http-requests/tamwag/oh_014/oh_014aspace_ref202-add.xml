    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Jimmy Torres on May 9 and 13, 1974 at an unknown location.  This interview covers Tony Torres' migration from Puerto Rico to New York, New York, and his work in haberdasheries and a bakery.  Torres mentions that he, his mother, and his brother migrated to New York, New York in 1918 in search of better economic opportunities.  He describes being sent to a series of orphanages after his mother died during the influenza epidemic in 1918.  He notes that while he did learn English in the orphanages, he also lost his native Spanish while living there and mentions that the orphans tended to stick together regardless of their nationality.  Torres explains that he worked various odd jobs until he found stable work in a haberdashery, emphasizing how specific trades were usually associated with specific social networks or ethnic groups.  He describes getting a job at a bakery through the newspaper; joining an unspecified bakers' union (likely the Journeymen Bakers Union of New York); being elected shop steward; and enduring a seven month strike for better wages and work hours.  He notes that, at the time of the strike, the union was composed of mostly independent locals that kept to themselves whereas, at the time of interview, the locals presented a more united front within the industry.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Torres explains that Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York remained mostly in tight-knit groups; migrants emphasized the importance of tradition, especially the retention of the Spanish language; and that their children integrated with other ethnic groups, diluting some of the strong Puerto Rican traditions.  He notes the lack of organization and leadership in the Puerto Rican population, which he believes contributed to their lack of a political presence, particularly in New York City.  Other topics include the relationships between different immigrant populations where he lived and worked; New York City politics, predominantly focusing on Fiorello La Guardia and Vito Marcantonio; the surge in Puerto Rican migration to the United States in the 1940s; Puerto Rican involvement in politics; the development of labor unions, with emphasis on the inclusion of immigrant and minority groups; the mechanization of bakery work and its impact on bakers; his leisure time activities; and a comparison between the importance of religion to his generation of Puerto Ricans and younger generations.</field>
