    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leonard Siciliano was interviewed by David Lightner and an unidentified interviewer on April 11, 1975 at the International Longshoremen's Association Union Hall, on Court Street in Brooklyn, New York.  Siciliano often speaks Italian throughout the interview.  Luigi Barrara, another member of the Union, is present at the interview, often acting as a translator between Italian and English, as well as clarifying some details.  Topics include Siciliano's childhood in Italy, his early work in New York, New York, and his union involvement.  Siciliano recollects his early life in Italy, including going to school; working on a fishing boat in the summers; his father working on large ships; joining the Italian Navy; and trying to support his family.  His early memories of New York City include being required to join the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) Local 1814 in order to work; working on an Army Base at Pier 2 in Brooklyn; and deciding to become a longshoreman since it did not require working papers.  Siciliano discusses how the ILA affected his job, specifically mentioning strikes happening consistently every two years for ten to twenty days each; the $13 compensation provided for work injuries being insufficient; and work gangs that would become an important part of the job.</field>
