    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Nina Cobb and Jay Facciolo on May 16, 1975 at an unspecified location.  The interview covers Lily Campanile's parents' background and immigration to the United States (US), her childhood in Illinois, her husband's working life, their marriage and family, her personal life, and members of her extended family.  Campanile discusses her father's life in Italy, his immigration to the US, and his work as a coal miner in Illinois.  She discusses her mother's childhood in Sicily, her work picking fruit as a child, and her immigration to the US.  She describes the ethnic composition of Louisville, Illinois, including the fact that hers was one of two Italian families and that most of the people in the town were Russian.  She also describes the ethnic composition of Benld, Illinois, which was mainly Polish and Russian, with her family being part of very small Italian minority.  She recounts how she met her husband; their engagement; and their decision to move from Chicago to New York.  She discusses his work scraping and painting ships in a Navy yard in New Jersey and his decision to become a longshoreman in order to work closer to home.  She discusses which piers he worked on in Brooklyn; the type of cargo he would help load; the unreliable nature of the work; and injuries he sustained at work.  She discusses her unhappiness at not having worked outside of the home, due to having to care for her mother as a young woman and then caring for her own children, and the isolation she felt as a result.  Other topics include not having time or money for leisure activities and her disappointment in missing out on these things as a young woman; double standards set by her parents for her and her brothers; her daughters' marriages and families; and her living situation at the time of the interview. </field>
