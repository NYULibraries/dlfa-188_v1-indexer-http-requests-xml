    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewer, location, and date of this interview are unknown.  The interview covers Sylvia Levine's childhood in Minsk, Russia; her work in garment factories in New York, New York; and her husband's life.  She discusses her childhood in Minsk, including learning Yiddish and Russian from a tutor in her home and attending Hebrew school.  She discusses her work in the United States (US), including the different types of ladies' garments she produced and production at the separate factories for each garment.  She describes her first job as a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union) and struggles with her supervisor over pricing of the garments.

Topics from her husband's life include his emigration from Russia; his travels across the US in search of work; his jobs as a machinist in Detroit, Michigan and Cleveland, Ohio; his work at the Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation in New Jersey; and his political opinions.</field>
