    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Joan Granucci and Martin Lesser.  The date and location are unknown.  The interview covers Benny Terranova's childhood, his family, his working life, and his union activity.  Terranova discusses his childhood; his education; his father's insistence that he leave school at age 14 to help in the bakery; and his father's indulgence of his children.  He discusses becoming interested in organizing his father's bakery as a member of an unspecified Italian bakers' union; working to organize other local bakeries; and becoming disillusioned with the industry.  He recounts his decision to become a longshoreman; his first jobs as a longshoreman; and unsafe conditions on the waterfront.  He recounts alternating between working on the waterfront and in the bakery for four years before switching to working as a longshoreman full time after seeing the work of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) to improve working conditions.  He discusses the frequent strikes organized by the ILA and how these led to steady increases in wages in the 1940s and early 1950s.  He describes the different jobs he held on the waterfront and his rise through the ranks, from working in the holds of the ships to being a superintendent working in an office.  He discusses officials of the ILA, in particular Anthony Anastasio and Joseph Ryan.  He describes the ethnic and racial demographics of the longshoremen in New York; the organization of ILA locals along racial and ethnic lines; and difficulties in organizing different racial and ethnic groups into one local.  He discusses the issues he felt were most important for longshoremen at the time of interview, including health and safety and improvement of pensions.</field>
