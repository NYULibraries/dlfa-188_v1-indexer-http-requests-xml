    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Karin Young at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens on 125th Street, Manhattan, New York on May 16, 1973. Main topics include Kelson Lee's work as a milliner; his life in New York, New York from the Prohibition era through World War II; and social activities in which he participated. Lee touches on his early life, including being the oldest of six children; having one sister who was a doctor; and his family spreading out around the United States while he stayed in New York. He discusses his work as a milliner, including starting by selling flowers to hat manufacturers before owning his own company manufacturing ladies' hats. He recalls his hiring practices, including the fact that most of his workers were women; that he would not hire immigrants, in particular Jewish people from Germany; and that he and his employees were members of the United Hatters of North America. He explains that his company survived the Great Depression because women did not stop wearing hats during the period. He comments on his social activities, including frequenting speakeasies, nightclubs, and cafes; and reading the New York Times,  New York Post, and  New York Herald Tribune. He also discusses his wife, including meeting her at a restaurant that he and his friends went to regularly; attending many social activities and events with her; never fighting in their 40 years of marriage; and missing her tremendously after she died.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Lee describes life in New York City between the Prohibition era and World War II, including the abundance of speakeasies; speakeasies that catered to different social classes; and the fact that gangsters only went to Lindy's on 50th Street in Manhattan and were not regularly seen elsewhere.  He recalls many individuals resorting to selling apples on street corners during the Depression; the crowds in the streets when the World War I armistice was signed; and his opinion that World War I was much more difficult to survive than World War II. </field>
