    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Linda Bauer on May 11, 1974 at an unspecified location.  The interview covers Arno Jacobson's childhood, his education, his working life, and his union activity.  Jacobson describes the people who lived in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and friends he had in the neighborhood.  He recalls that he was fearful as a child as a result of his sheltered upbringing.  He describes his father's work as a leather cutter in handbag factories; a summer he worked with his father in one of these factories when he was 16 years old; the difference in pay between skilled and unskilled laborers; and racial discrimination amongst the workers.  He describes his time at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan; how inclusive an environment it was; and how it matured him.  He discusses his decision to drop out of the City College of New York and jobs he held subsequent to that decision.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Jacobson discusses his job in the Photography Department of the Brooklyn Museum and how he organized and led the Staff Association, a union of employees at the Museum.  He discusses the Association's decision to join District Council 37 and issues the Association faced during his time as its head, including which employees were allowed to be members and budget struggles faced by the Museum.  He also describes his decision to declare himself as a conscientious objector after the Korean War.</field>
