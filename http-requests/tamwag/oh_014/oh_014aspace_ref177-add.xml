    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on March 26, 1973. The interviewer and location of the interview are unknown. This interview covers Joseph Savio's childhood in Italy, his immigration to the United States (US) in 1901, and his life in New York, New York up to the time of the interview. Savio briefly describes living in Italy, noting that there was a severe economic divide between those who owned property and those who did not. He discusses his family's immigration, with his parents and younger siblings following the earlier immigration of his older siblings. He recounts the family settling in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan; briefly attending school on Solomon Street; struggling to learn English; working as a delivery boy; and being apprenticed to a glove cutter. He discusses his work pressing and cutting the fingers of gloves; perfecting his trade; becoming the foreman of the Steinberg Company for several years; and opening his own business on East 28th Street. He describes the working conditions of the glove factories as filthy, noting that he contracted a disease from the fumes produced in processing the gloves. Other topics include Italian immigrants' opinions on World War I and World War II; the shift in economic and living conditions in the US during the wars; discrimination faced by Italians and Jewish people in the areas he lived; and differences between New York City and his hometown.</field>
