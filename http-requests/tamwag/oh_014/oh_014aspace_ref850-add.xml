    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Laurie Leifer at the offices of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) in Manhattan, New York on an unspecified date. The interview covers Yetta Altman's childhood in Poland, her working life in the United States (US), and her union activity. Altman describes her childhood in Poland, recounting a pogrom that took place in the area where her family lived and the fact that her mother would lock her in the house to protect her from anti-Semitic violence. She discusses the differences in religious observance between Jewish people in Poland and in the US. She recalls working in different factories, including the Albert Waist Company, and describes how the ILGWU would often send workers into non-union shops in order to unionize them. She recalls strikes in which she participated, including one at which she was arrested for pinching a strikebreaker. Altman describes her happiness in being able to bring her mother and younger siblings over to the US. She discusses her mother's reactions to life in New York City and her pleasure in having running water in their apartment. </field>
