    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on May 13, 1975.  The location is likely the Carroll Gardens Senior Center at 380 Court Street in Brooklyn, New York.  The interviewers are unknown.  Christine DeMatate, Angela Santa Maria, and Anna DeCaro are all interviewed at the same time and frequently speak Italian.  Anna DeCaro leaves the interview after about ten minutes.  This interview covers DeMatate's and Santa Maria's childhoods in Italy, their immigration to New York, and their work in New York City's garment industry.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Christine DeMatate describes her childhood in Italy, noting that her father was a longshoreman; that her parents immigrated to the United States (US) with her siblings; and that her immigration was delayed due to an unspecified eye disease. She discusses working in the garment industry doing piecework on Henry Street in Brooklyn, New York and continuing to work outside the home after the birth of her son, which displeased her husband. She recounts joining the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 89 in 1933 and describes how the union alleviated poor working conditions and promoted better wages. She notes that although the ILGWU decreased the number of hours she had to work overall, some weekend work was mandatory, which conflicted with church services on Sunday.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Angela Santa Maria describes her childhood in the same town as DeMatate, noting that most of the people in the town were employed as fishermen or longshoremen.  She recounts that her husband immigrated to the US before returning to Italy to marry her and bring her to the US.  She describes how she made garments at home but moved on to factory work when her children grew older; how she joined the ILGWU Local 89; and how her children worked with her once they finished school.</field>
