    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Ginny Yans on May 7, 1974 at Anthony Raia's home in Brooklyn, New York. Throughout the interview, Raia speaks in both Italian and English. Topics of discussion include Raia's family; his emigration from Sicily, Italy; his relationship with his wife and children; his work in the United States (US); and his union involvement. Raia discusses his immigration to the US, including his grandparents immigrating prior to his immigration; sending for his siblings to join him after the death of their father in 1920; and leaving Sicily for economic and social reasons. He recalls meeting his wife after one of her singing performances; having three children with her; feeling proud of his children's accomplishments; believing that men and women need to be treated as equals; and training his wife as a machine operator in a dress factory. He recalls different jobs he held, including work at a piano factory; on submarines in the Brooklyn Navy Yard; for the American Can Company; in shoe manufacturing; and as a part-time actor. He discusses his union involvement, including being a member of the Boot and Shoe Workers Union and an unspecified millinery union; serving on the executive board of the Boot and Shoe Workers Union; being involved in multiple strikes; and being called a communist because of his involvement with unions.</field>
