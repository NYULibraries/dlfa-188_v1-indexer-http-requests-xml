    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by John Jentz and Frank Farragaso at a senior citizen center on Court Street in Brooklyn, New York (likely the Carroll Park Senior Center).  The date of the interview is unknown.  This interview covers Corrado Frasca's childhood in Pollago, Italy; his undocumented immigration to the United States (US) in 1926; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn.  Frasca begins this interview by describing his childhood in Pollago, Italy, recalling doing simple jobs for the local fishermen and seamen when he was eight years old.  He explains that he moved to Genoa when he was twelve and worked for several years aboard a passenger ship.  He discusses an uncle in New York encouraging him to come to the United States, and Frasca jumping ship in Norfolk, Virginia in 1926.  He describes traveling to Baltimore, Maryland to avoid the authorities and locals who spoke Italian coming to his aid by giving him room and board free of charge.  Frasca explains that his uncle brought him to Brooklyn where he began working as a longshoreman.  He describes shifting occupations depending on the seasons; working on ships going to South America in the winter; working as a longshoreman in Brooklyn during the rest of the year; and later establishing his own business as a peddler and fruit seller.  Frasca mentions joining a club established by immigrants from his hometown and the club providing social and fiscal support to its members during hard times.  He describes how he met his wife, an American citizen, through his uncle, who served as a matchmaker in their apartment building.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Throughout the interview, Frasca describes a tension between his Italian heritage and his new life in the US, including his refusal to be stationed in Italy during World War II for fear of fighting his family and the way in which he gradually learned English through his wife and conversations he had with non-Italian longshoremen with whom he worked.  He describes the differences between his generation and his son's generation, noting his opinion that the younger generation is less social and less attached to traditional family values.</field>
