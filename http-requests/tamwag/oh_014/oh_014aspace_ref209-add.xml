    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Mark Hirsch on March 29, 1973 at Frank Wagner's home in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York.  This interview covers Frank Wagner's childhood in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan; his work as a delivery boy, machinist, track worker, and bedding maker; and his union activity.  Wagner begins by describing his childhood, noting that his mother's sister raised him and his siblings after his mother died.  He explains that he lived in a railroad flat on 235 East 80th Street in the Upper East Side and recounts having frugal meals and fighting with other children over broken boxes that were used as fuel for the stove.  He notes that he started working at nine years old in various jobs, including newspaper and grocery delivery boy.  He discusses his and his siblings' education; his time playing baseball; and the demographics of his neighborhood.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Wagner recounts wanting to follow in his cousin's footsteps as a machinist; his cousin helping him get a job at his company handling work applications and introducing new employees to their departments; working to become an apprentice machinist; and joining the International Association of Machinists (IAM) Lodge 434.  He recalls a nine month strike that occurred in 1921 when he finished his apprenticeship, noting that the strike failed due to strikebreakers brought in from England and the IAM declaring the strike unauthorized.  He describes working briefly for the New York Central Railroad as a track worker before working in the bedding industry and joining the Bedding, Curtain and Drapery Workers Union Local 140 of the United Furniture Workers of America.  He explains his involvement in both the industry and the union by covering topics such as the industry's filthy factory conditions; his participation in strikes in 1932 and 1934; his work in negotiating better pay and more holidays for Local 140's members; his time as an elected union officer in 1945; and his time as unofficial president of the union from 1947 to 1951.  Other topics include his activity in politics, specifically in an unspecified Democratic club; his time on the education committee of the IAM; his memories of hiding in local community members' houses in order to avoid the police during the machinists' strike of 1921; his love of playing pool; and his wife, who immigrated to the US from Germany in 1929.</field>
