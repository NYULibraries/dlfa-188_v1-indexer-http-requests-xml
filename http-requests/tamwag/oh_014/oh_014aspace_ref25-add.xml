    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted on December 12 and December 22, 1975 and January 21, 1976 by Jay Facciolo at Thomas Burton's home in Brooklyn, New York. Topics include Burton's life in Jamaica, his immigration to the United States (US), his work as a carpenter, and his union involvement. Burton begins by discussing his early life in Jamaica, including his parents dying when he was very young; his grandparents believing his father was an unfit parent; and Burton's father raising his brothers while Burton was raised by his grandparents. He recalls the educational system in Jamaica; and his attendance at school until he was 14 years old. He discusses his work as a carpenter's apprentice; sharecropping and land distribution on his grandfather's farm; and social activities such as cricket and rounders. He recounts his first impressions of the US, including his feeling of surprise when he first saw snow; his opinion that people worried less in Jamaica than they did in the US; and the fact that he had no intention of living in the US permanently. While discussing his career, Burton mentions working in foundries before joining the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America Local 18 in 1926; and working for the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. He also discusses racial tensions between carpenters, particularly their disputes when Black workers earned pay equal to white workers.</field>
