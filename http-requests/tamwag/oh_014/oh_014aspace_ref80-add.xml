    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by John Jentz at Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union on November 12 and 24, 1975 and at Harold Harris' home in the Bronx, New York on January 29, 1976.  The main topics of this interview include Harris' childhood in Jamaica; his work at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York; his union activity; and his political ideologies.  Harris discusses his childhood in Jamaica, including not having any siblings; his mother living in Panama; his father dying when Harris was seven years old; and his aunt and cousin raising him.  He recalls his different jobs in Jamaica, which included farm worker, bank clerk, cook, and employee of the US Consulate in Jamaica.  He discusses his early experiences at Montefiore Hospital, including living in the hospital dormitories for two years; beginning his employment in the dietary unit delivering food to patients in a tuberculosis ward; not planning on staying at Montefiore for an extended period of time; and eventually  feeling obligated to stay due to his loyalty to both the patients and his co-workers.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Harris discusses his union activity, including his push for better treatment of employees and unionization at Montefiore Hospital long before the entrance of Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in 1958; the failure of Local 1199 to unionize the hospital in 1954; and the necessity of New York City hospitals to stagger strikes because Local 1199 could not support every hospital striking at once. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Harris also discusses his political ideology, in particular that he was a supporter of Marcus Garvey and that he was more interested in social activism within his community than traditional leisure activities.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Harold Harris was born in Kingston, Jamaica in 1911.  He worked predominantly in the food and domestic service industries in Jamaica.
