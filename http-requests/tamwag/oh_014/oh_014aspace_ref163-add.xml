    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewer, date, and location are unknown.  The interview covers Hersh Rabinowitz's life in Palestine and the United States (US), including his work, political activity, and union activity.  The beginning of the interview can be found in the recording titled Unidentified Russian man, Rose Gelberg, and Hersh Rabinowitz.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rabinowitz recounts being elected executive secretary of city council in Tel Aviv and Jaffa, Palestine in 1921; deciding to leave Palestine; and immigrating to the US in order to continue his education in 1923.  He discusses studying English in order to attend night school at the City College of New York and working different jobs while attending college, including laundry worker and engineer.  He discusses his union activity, explaining that he was always very active in trade unions, from his time in Palestine in a metal workers' union, as a member of the Laundry Workers' International Union Local 280, and as a founding member of the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists, and Technicians (FAECT) in 1933.  He describes the collapse of FAECT in 1951, attributing it to a strike of engineers at the Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO)  in 1947 and an investigation of FAECT by the House Un-American Activities Committee.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rabinowitz discusses the socialist movement in the US, describing socialist leaders Morris Hillquit, Meyer London, Norman Thomas, and Eugene V. Debs as giants and explaining that there was no one to succeed them.  He discusses, in great detail, reasons for the failure of the socialist movement, including leaders of powerful labor unions, such as the United Mine Workers and United Auto Workers, suggesting their members invest in the stock market and not participate in political movements as long as their financial interests were met by their employers.  He provides reasons that children of immigrants would not make the same sacrifices as their parents and participate in progressive movements.</field>
