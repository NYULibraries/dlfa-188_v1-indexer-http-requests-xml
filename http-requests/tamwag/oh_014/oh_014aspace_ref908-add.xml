    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Janice Albert.  The date and location of the interview are unknown.  The interview covers Bella Hyman's childhood in Austria, her working life in the United States (US), and her union activity.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hyman discusses attending night school in the US; participating in organizing garment factories for the union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union); and wishing she could have continued her education but having to work in order to pay for her parents' immigration to the US.  She recounts her childhood in a small town in Austria, including her education and her father studying in the synagogue while her mother managed the family's grocery store and catered events in the town.  She describes her and her siblings' immigration to the US; their consolidation of their savings in order to pay for their parents' immigration; and the family's struggles during the Great Depression.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hyman discusses her life in New York, New York after her immigration, including gaining experience in garment factories through different jobs, and moving between different Jewish neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx.  She recounts wanting to become a nurse; starting a training program at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan; and having to leave the program because it did not pay enough for her to contribute to her parents' immigration.  She discusses attending night school and lectures at the Rand School of Social Science in Manhattan; being inclined towards the Socialist Party of America; and finding time to attend dances and sporting events.  She describes the ethnic demographics of the workforce in the garment industry, in particular, the fact that the workers were mostly Jewish, Italian, and Polish, which led to language issues while organizing the factories into an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union).  She describes the daydreams the garment workers would share with each other and the songs they sang while they worked, but states that these hopes did not preclude their participation in unionizing efforts in order to improve working conditions.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics include her work visiting retired union members; the movement of the garment industry from the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan to 7th Avenue in the Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan; her husband's background; and women in leadership roles in unions, specifically Rose Pesotta and Pauline Newman.</field>
