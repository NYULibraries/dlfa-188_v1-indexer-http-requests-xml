    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Nina Cobb on May 16, 1975.  The location is likely the Carroll Gardens Senior Center at 380 Court Street in Brooklyn, New York.  Many people can be heard conversing over one another and passing in and out of the room, making the current narrator hard to hear.  Several other people were present at this interview including Frances and Rose, who are only identified by their first names; Lily (likely Lily Campanile); an unspecified man who acts as a translator between the interviewer and Stella Loregio; and several other unidentified women.  This interview covers the history of  Adele Rosanno's father; Rosanno's life in Brooklyn, New York; parts of Stella Loregio's life and work; and several unnamed participants' stories of their lives and work experiences in the United States (US).  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rosanno begins by describing her father; his immigration to the US from Italy in 1889; and his inheritance of his father's farm in the Abruzzi region of Italy.  She describes his struggle to find work as a cabinetmaker in the US, noting that he worked on the subway in New York City before getting a job at E. B. Jordan, a furniture company, where he later became a floor manager.  Rosanno recounts meeting her husband at a masquerade dance; working as a manager in his restaurant on Houston Street; and monitoring the bar and wait staff as they had a tendency to steal from the business.  Other topics from Rosanno's portion of the interview include her family and their educations and occupations; her job as a saleswoman; and her involvement with the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary &amp; Saint Stephen Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rosanno introduces her friend, identified as Rose, who discusses the types of community organizations in Carroll Gardens and emphasizes the role of religious organizations.  She notes that many of the volunteers were older women who no longer worked, but needed  to socialize and keep busy.  She focuses on the contributions of those in the Jeanmen's Guild of Saint Agnes Church and the volunteer work that went into making bed jackets for Saint Rose's Free Home for Incurable Cancer at 71 Jackson Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">All of the women describe their impressions of how the role of women has changed since they were young women, specifically noting the increasing number of women in the workforce. One woman recalls working as a telephone operator until her marriage and wishes she had continued working outside the home after raising her children because she liked her job. The women compare their children to the generation of children at the time of the interview, remarking that children have become more spoiled but also more intelligent. Many of them note that they knew nothing about sex or pregnancy until they married because their parents felt that children should not be exposed to such knowledge. In contrast, they observe how the generation of children at the time of the interview know more about these topics than they did at the same age.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Stella Loregio speaks predominantly in Italian, with an unidentified man acting as a translator at the very end of her narrative.  She describes her immigration to the US; parts of her family history; her husband's family and his death; a trip she made to Italy and her return to the US in 1950; and the life of her children at the time of the interview.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other topics discussed in the general interview include Italian mourning traditions, particularly those affiliated with widows, and many of the women's trips to Italy, both in the past and at the time of the interview.</field>
