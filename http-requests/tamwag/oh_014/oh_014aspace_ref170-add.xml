    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Mary B. Alexander at the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home in the Bronx, New York on an unspecified date.  The audio recording for this interview is missing.  This interview covers Alfonso Rockwell's childhood in Virginia; his migrations to Atlantic City, New Jersey and New York, New York; and his work and leisure activities.  Rockwell describes his hometown, noting his work on the family farm and differences in the town between his childhood and the time of the interview.  He notes that there was a distinction between men's work and women's work, with men fishing and women working on the farms or in tomato factories.  He explains that he left Virginia when he was 16 years old because he had heard that jobs and wages were better in Atlantic City.  He describes working in construction in Ocean City, New Jersey; liking the lack of a union; marrying his first wife; and going to baseball games, pool rooms, dances, and church during his free time.  He discusses segregation in his neighborhood; transitioning from construction work to cooking for job security; and his preference for the Postal Savings System over banks.  He describes moving to New York; working odd jobs because of the lack of steady work; and returning to Virginia when his grandmother became sick.  Other topics include the relationship between Baltimore, Maryland and his hometown; his time in the Army during World War II; his political affiliation; and his religious beliefs.</field>
