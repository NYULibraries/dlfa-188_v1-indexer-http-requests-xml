    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Sasha Silverstein on November 13, 1975 at Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union in Manhattan, New York. Topics of discussion include  Annie Cole's childhood, education, work experience, and union involvement.  Cole briefly discusses her early life in Alabama and Texas; her education at the Tuskegee Institute; and the hardships she endured in attending college, including working long hours during the day and being too tired to study at night.  She spends a majority of the interview discussing her working life, including a six month internship at an unspecified hospital on 125th street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York and her job as a dietary aide at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York, which she began in 1952.  She discusses in detail her reasons for joining Local 1199, including speaking with a strike organizer about her frustrations regarding taking on the work of the striking workers, in addition to her own.  Cole discusses issues that she faced once she was a member of the union, including not receiving the same pay as hospital employees with different job titles, even though they did the same work, and unfair scheduling and benefits.  She also discusses her struggles against management regarding workplace and pay discrimination throughout her career.</field>
