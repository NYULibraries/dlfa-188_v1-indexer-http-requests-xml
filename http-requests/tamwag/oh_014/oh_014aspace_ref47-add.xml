    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Joan Granucci in Brooklyn, New York on April 12, 1973. The audio recording for this interview is missing. This interview covers Vincenzo DeRosa's childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1903; and his work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York. DeRosa begins by describing the landscapes of his hometown. He recalls that he immigrated to the US in order to make a fortune and traveled with one of his cousins because he was too young to go by himself. He settled in Brooklyn with his brother and other countrymen from Naples. He describes the development of the longshoremen's union to which he belonged (likely the International Longshoremen's Association); the ethnic composition of the longshoremen; and the tension between Irish and Italian immigrants. Other topics include a comparison between Brooklyn in the past and at the time of the interview; his children's occupations; his religious and political affiliations; his regret at never having returned to Italy; and his love for America.</field>
