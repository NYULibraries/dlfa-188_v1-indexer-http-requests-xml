    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This recording contains a compilation of excerpts from interviews from and descriptions of the New York City Immigrant Oral History Project, as well as musical interludes. This compilation may have been created for a radio broadcast, but it is unclear if it was ever broadcasted. The volume and sound quality of the recording fluctuate between excerpts. The recording begins with an introduction to the project by Scott Weir, and an unidentified female interviewer explains that the recording addresses the experiences of three groups: Jewish people from Eastern Europe; Italians; and African-American migrants from the southern United States (US). She notes that the excerpts reference the experiences of these groups in New York, New York; in factories; and in the formation of unions. She describes the social, economic, and political conditions that prompted many Jewish people from Eastern Europe to immigrate to the US and interview excerpts follow discussing anti-Semitism, religious traditions, and education. Weir gives a brief history of Italian immigration to the US, and interview excerpts that follow discuss the economic contrast between landowners and agricultural laborers in Italy, and the fact that many Italians expected to return to Italy once they had enough money. The last section of the recording contains interview excerpts discussing the history of African Americans from Reconstruction to the 1970s; racial discrimination; the sequence of family migration; and ethnic relations among people in different New York City neighborhoods.</field>
