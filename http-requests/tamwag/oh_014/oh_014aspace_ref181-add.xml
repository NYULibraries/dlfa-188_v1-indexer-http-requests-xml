    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Karen Kearns at the Workmen's Circle Home for the Aged in the Bronx, New York on an unspecified date. The interview covers Ida Seltzer's early life in Russia; her immigration to and early impressions of New York, New York; her working life; and her marriage. Seltzer recounts her early life in a small town near Minsk, Russia, including being a member of the Jewish community in a town populated by both Jewish people and Christians and being taught to read and write Hebrew or Yiddish by a tutor in her home. She describes her management of her household; her care of her younger siblings after her mother died; and her difficult relationship with her stepmother, which led to her immigration to the United States (US). Her memories of life in New York City in the early 20th century include reacting to the difference in fashions and hairstyles; eating ice cream for the first time; and learning to use a straw. She recounts her first job in a factory, including learning to use sewing machines and being fined for being late to work before becoming accustomed to time clocks. She describes numerous attempts at organizing by unspecified unions in the factories in which she worked and her decisions to find new work when these attempts failed. She recounts working at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory for one day before the fire in 1911 and describes the general darkness in the factory, the locked stairwells, and the fact that there was no drinking water for the workers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Seltzer discusses her living situations before her marriage, including sharing a three room apartment with four other family members when she first arrived in the US and moving to another small apartment with the family of a friend. She recounts meeting her husband at her brother's restaurant on Rutgers Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, where other workers would meet; learning about labor unions and the Workmen's Circle through her husband; and joining the Workmen's Circle once they were married. She describes their large wedding with 500 guests, and banquets and dances held by the Workmen's Circle that she attended with her husband.</field>
