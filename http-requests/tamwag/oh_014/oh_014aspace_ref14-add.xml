    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Francis Facciolo on February 26 and March 12, 1975.  The location is unknown.  This interview covers Abraham Belson's childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in Massachusetts and New York.  Belson begins by describing part of his father's history, recounting a time when the Russian government forced the Jewish population to convert to a religion other than Judaism and his father's refusal and subsequent draft into the army for fifteen years.  Belson recounts his membership in an unspecified Jewish club (likely the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia) aligned against the czar and the feeling that he had to work against an authority that was not concerned with his well-being.  He describes immigrating to the US; living briefly in Massachusetts; and moving to New York City where his family and many friends from his hometown lived.  He spends the rest of the interview focused on the happenings of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which he joined in 1907.  He mentions an unsuccessful strike in 1907 that lasted 13 weeks, resulting in landlords evicting families from their homes when they were unable to pay rent and the fact that they had to beg in the streets until the union was forced to compromise.  He explains that the union reorganized between 1907 and 1910 and rallied for its first large general strike in 1910.  Belson describes the camaraderie that he felt with his fellow union members; the union events they attended together; and the picnics and other outings they had during their free time.  He notes that this was common in several tight-knit communities in Brooklyn, Bronxville, and other parts of New York that were populated predominantly by ILGWU members.  He recalls becoming a union officer in 1949, emphasizing that this position required that he earn the respect of both workers and management in order to be elected and reelected every year.  Belson describes how the conditions of the workplace for garment workers improved due to union influence, noting better wages, better job hours, more job security, and the fact that workers were no longer required to rent their own machines in order to work.  He shares an anecdote about a strike in Newark, New Jersey that resulted in a prolonged stalemate between management and the union and how he and other union members strongarmed the management to cooperate with the union liaison.</field>
