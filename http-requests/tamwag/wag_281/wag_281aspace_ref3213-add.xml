    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is comprised of the administrative files of the union, including correspondence of its officers, legal representatives, and Executive Director George Heller. The union's efforts on behalf of its members of color as well as other disenfranchised members are highlighted through the work of the union's many committees, the Department for Professional Employees, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The series also contains materials documenting the union's philanthropic efforts, including the George Heller Foundation and the Theatre Authority, an organization that provides union talent for fund-raising activities and award shows. In order to keep all of the staff involved with the union's daily activities, Read Files (referred to as "Blues" in the National office) consisting of each department's daily correspondence were circulated throughout the office. This series also includes files on the union's pension and health programs, in addition to its interest in and involvement with labor legislation being discusses in Congress.</field>
