    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The business of the AFTRA National is conducted at a yearly convention beginning in 1938 until 1989 when it became biannual. The conventions for 1942 and 1945 did not occur due to World War II. Documented in this series is the fact that as of 1960, the convention numbering changed to reflect AFTRA's age as opposed to the actual number of conventions. The convention attendees consisted of representatives from all of the locals elected by their own constituencies, with the number of delegates from each local based on the number of members in each local. At the conventions members also heard reports from the National Executive Secretary as well as the National President and Treasurer. The important responsibilities that fell to the members attending each convention is documented in this series including the election of all National officers, addressing potential constitutional amendments, and recommending negotiation proposals from their constituent members.</field>
