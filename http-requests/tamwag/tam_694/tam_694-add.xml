    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Rabbi Arthur Schneier Papers consists of material collected and created by Rabbi Arthur Schneier dating from 1956 to 2016 pertaining to his work as a rabbi and international advocate for peace, human rights, and religious freedom. The bulk of the collection documents Schneier's work as the president and founder of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, or ACF, an interfaith coalition of business and religious leaders promoting tolerance and conflict resolution throughout the world. ACF created and co-sponsored protests, seminars, conferences, summits, and awards about creating international peace and tolerance through conflict resolution and the expansion of human and religious rights. Material from these events include: programs, correspondence, schedules, lists of attendees, agendas, press clippings and releases, photographs, images, video recordings, and travel documents. A small number of VHS tapes, microcassette tapes, and audio cassette tapes were recorded of ACF's annual award dinners and luncheons as well as the seminars and conferences co-sponsored and created by ACF. ACF also hosted visiting political and religious leaders of international renown and sent delegations abroad to report to meet with international political and religious leaders. The collection mostly contains paper-based and born-digital material, with a small portion of audio cassette tapes documenting those meetings.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Rabbi Arthur Schneier also attended several domestic and international events as individual advocate for religious tolerance and international peace. A large portion of the collection documents Schneier's constant trips to Israel, Europe, and East Asia to attend international events about religious and human rights. Material from Schneier's trips includes: itineraries, schedules, correspondence, photographs, travel documents and ephemera, and reports. A small number of audio cassette tapes and 16mm films were recorded from various international and domestic events attended by Rabbi Schneier as an advocate for religious rights. Another small part of the collection consists of photographs, images, programs, correspondence, born-digital sound and video recordings that record Rabbi Schneier receiving awards and honorary doctorate degrees for his vocational work as a rabbi and advocate. Finally, this collection contains material that documents Schneier's vocation as a rabbi first as the Rabbi of Congregation B'nai Jacob located in Brooklyn, New York then as the Senior Rabbi of Park East Synagogue in New York, New York.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rabbi Arthur Schneier (1930- ) was born on March 20, 1930 in Vienna, Austria, and lived under Nazi occupation in Budapest until age 17. Schneier immigrated to the United States in 1947. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Yeshiva University in 1951 and earned a Masters of Arts from New York University in 1953.  In 1955, Schneier received his rabbinical ordination from Yeshiva University. Schneier became the Senior Rabbi at Park East Synagogue in 1962. As of 2019, Schneier continues to serve as the Senior Rabbi of Park East Synagogue. Before coming to Park East Synagogue, Schneier served as the rabbi of Congregation B'nai Jacob in Brooklyn, New York. In 1975, Rabbi Arthur Schneier founded the Park East Day School. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over the years, Rabbi Arthur Schneier has been an active member of many prominent religious and political organizations including: the Council on Foreign Relations, United Nations Development Corporation, United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Committee. Schneier founded the Appeal of Conscience Foundation in 1965 and has served as the president of the Foundation since its inception. The Appeal of Conscience Foundation brings together business and religious leaders to promote peace and tolerance internationally and domestically.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The collection was donated by Rabbi Arthur Schneier in 2017 and 2019. The accession numbers associated with this gift are 2017.035, 2017.067, 2017.075, and 2019.011.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">All of the materials in this collection were stored either at the Appeal of Conscience office on 251 West 71st street or at the Park East Synagogue at 163 East 67th street. Material was packed by Rabbi Arthur Schneier and his daughter, Karen Schneier.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">During accessioning, the curator was able to weed out most of the boxes that contained administrative and/or financial files. However, there were some administrative files embedded within certain boxes, especially the ones that focus on the Annual Award Dinners which were weeded during processing. Additionally, there were several boxes full of unannotated envelopes, invitation and RSVP cards for the Appeal of Conscience Foundation's Annual Awards Dinner. Two copies of the invitations and RSVP cards were retained, the rest of the material was deaccessioned. There were some boxes that contained receipts, tax return forms, tax audit correspondence, reimbursement documents, and a financial investment portfolio for the United States-Japan Foundation that were deaccessioned from the collection. There were several folders of articles, booklets, pamphlets, and reports about international countries which were not created by the Appeal of Conscience Foundation that had little to no research value which were also deaccessioned. In the same vein as the articles, booklets, pamphlets, and reports, the donor also kept folders of speeches by world leaders from various conferences, summits, forum, news conferences that are not annotated which were also discarded. There were two yarmulkes, housed in boxes 108 and 183, that were offered back to the donor and deaccessioned. </field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">After consulting with the digital archivist, six data cartridges were separated from the collection, offered back to the donor, and deaccessioned. These cartridges were labeled as backup files and are currently unable to be imaged by NYU. The digital archivist said they will need to be sent to a vendor and probably do not contain information of high research value. There were a number of optical discs and floppy disks which blank, damaged, or had copyright issues that were deaccessioned from the collection. Please see the deaccessioning checklist in the collection file for a detailed list of optical disc and floppy disk deaccessions.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Two audio cassette tapes were removed from the collection due to copyright issues. Fifteen audio cassette tapes were also removed from the collection, because they were blank. One 16mm film was removed from the collection due to copyright issues.</field>
