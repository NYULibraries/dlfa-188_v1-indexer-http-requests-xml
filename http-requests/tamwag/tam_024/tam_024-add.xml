    <field name="bioghist_teim">Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) is a radical student group that descended from the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS) which was founded in 1905. The ISS changed its name in 1921 to the League for Industrial Democracy (LID), a social-democratic educational and organizational group. Its student branch, the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID), merged with National Student League in 1935 to form American Student Union (ASU) but soon split over ASUs alleged communist affiliations. SLID revived in 1946 changing its name to Students for a Democratic Society in 1959. It was expelled from the LID in 1965 and gained national prominence in the late 1960s as SDS.</field>
