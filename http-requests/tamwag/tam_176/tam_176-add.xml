    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The brief biographical series contains some personal correspondence, memorabilia, photographs and obituaries. The bulk of the collection consists of Recht's unpublished writings, including: A World to Win, an autobiography (along with several autobiographical fragments) covering Recht's life through the early 1930s, including his travels throughout the Soviet Union;  Selector H. One, a satirical science fiction novel written in the 1940s; and an untitled and incomplete novel largely about "Ernest Strohman," an immigrant of Bohemian origin. Other writings include various poems, two untitled plays dealing with Jewish history, and an early (1907) pamphlet-length non-fiction manuscript, The Bohemian in America. The published writings consist of several articles dealing with civil rights and Jewish history.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Charles C. Recht (1887-1965) was born in Bohemia to Jewish parents, emigrated to the United States at age thirteen, and graduated from New York University Law School in 1910. He served as general counsel for the New York Bureau of Legal Advice, which provided free legal service to men who resisted the World War I era draft laws. Recht also represented many radicals who faced deportation at that time, and later served as an officer of a the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born (ACPFB). ACPFB was affiliated with the Communist Party USA, but Recht was never a party member. After Ludwig Martens was deported in 1921, Recht officially represented Soviet interests in the United States until 1933, when diplomatic relations were established. Recht published two novels, Rue with a Difference(1924) and Babylon on Hudson(1932), and a book of poems, Manhattan Made(1930). He also translated the work of August Strindberg and other playwrights, and wrote widely on law, politics, theater and Jewish history. His wife, Aristine Munn Recht, a physician, was at one time Dean of Women at NYU's Washington Square College.</field>
