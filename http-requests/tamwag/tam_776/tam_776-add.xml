    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection consists of 17 albums of trading cards and stamps from the 1920s through the 1970s. The bulk of these albums focus on life in the Belgian Congo (later known as the Democratic Republic of Congo), Rhodesia, and other European colonies in Africa. The albums and cards were produced by corporations such as Players Tobacco, Astra Confectioners, and a variety of chocolatiers. The stamps were packaged with their products and used for marketing and promotional purposes. The bulk of the albums in this collection were intended for children. This collection illustrates the intersection of colonialism and advertising, and how colonial life was portrayed to the people living on the mainland.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also includes an undated poster for a student protest of colonialism, a promotional poster about rubber plantations in the Belgian Congo, and three prints illustrating life in the colonies of Kenya and Rhodesia.</field>
