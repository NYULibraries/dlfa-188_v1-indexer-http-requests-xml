    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Libby Frank Papers document the 1951 World Youth Festival in Berlin, East Germany through songbooks, pamphlets, and the periodical World Youth, collected by Frank during her participation in the event. The promotion of unity between nationalities is documented in the periodicals and songbooks, while the pamphlets were created by individual European governments to disseminate these messages.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Libby Frank attended the World Youth Festival of 1951 in Berlin, then part of the German Democratic Republic. Frank was a subscriber to the periodical World Youth in 1952. The World Youth Festival encouraged students to advocate for global peace through annual meetings of the Council of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, who also organized the event. They were an international youth organization founded in 1945, recognized by the United Nations as an international youth non-governmental organization, who characterized themselves as anti-imperialist and left-wing. The 1951 festival took place in the international context of the Korean War, the rise of communism in China and Europe, and growing tensions between the Soviet Union and western nations.</field>
