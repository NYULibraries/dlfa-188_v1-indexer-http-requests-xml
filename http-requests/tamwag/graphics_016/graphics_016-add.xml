    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains a variety of graphic and photographic materials, most of which relate to Camp Wo-Chi-Ca. Ten silk-screened images on construction paper, which appear to be part of a book on a gentleman nicknamed "Mendy," were produced at Camp-Wo-Chi-Ca. There are also two photographs, one of Vaino Hill, a caretaker at Wo-Chi-Ca, and the other of a memorial plaque or grave marker for two men who died in the Spanish Civil War, Ralph Wardlaw and Wilfred Mendelson (possibly the "Mendy" referenced in the silk-screen images). There is also a black-and-white print (possibly a woodblock) depicting two men drawing a plow, as well as a watercolor portrait attributed to "J. Calazzi."</field>
