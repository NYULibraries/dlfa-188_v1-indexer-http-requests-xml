    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Biographical and Correspondence series is divided into two subseries, alphabetical and chronological, and principally consists of correspondence. Notable are a file of 1938 correspondence between Allen and his wife, Isabelle Auerbach, much of it written during his trip to the Philippines; correspondence with William Z. Foster, who sought Allen's advice regarding his writings; a polemical exchange with Hyman Lumer, regarding his War Economy and Crisis (1954); correspondence with Japanese Marxist publisher Takeshi "Fred" Haga; some of Allen's student writings; and a file on his dismissal in 1928 from his position as a philosophy instructor at the University of Pennsylvania. Also included is some of Isabelle Auerbach's later correspondence, mostly pertaining to her work with International Publishers.</field>
