    <field name="bioghist_teim">Representing workers in the legal profession, the Legal Services Staff Association (LSSA) is part of the National Organization of Legal Services Workers (NOLSW), which itself is Local 2320 of the United Automobile Workers of America (UAW).  The membership of LSSA consists of employees of Legal Services NYC (formerly Community Action for Legal Services) and MFY Legal Services, which provide free legal assistance to people in New York City.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">LSSA was organized in New York City in 1972, one of the first unions in the legal profession.  It played a critical role in the 1978 formation of NOLSW.  In 1980, NOLSW affiliated with District 65 during the period in which District 65 itself affiliated with the UAW.  When District 65 collapsed in the mid-1990s, NOLSW became UAW Local 2320.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Today, LSSA's 270 members make it the largest unit in NOLSW.  Not surprisingly, given its membership of employees in legal services organizations, LSSA is a highly active and visible unit within both NOLSW and the UAW.</field>
