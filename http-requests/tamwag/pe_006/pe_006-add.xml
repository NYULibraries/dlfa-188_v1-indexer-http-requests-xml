    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Hatters, Cap, and Millinery Workers International Union (UHCMW) was formed in 1934 by the amalgamation of United Hatters of North America and the Cloth Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers International Union. The United Hatters of North America was established in New York in 1896 as the result of the merger of two Knights of Labor-affiliated unions in the men's hat industry, the Hat Makers and the Hat Finishers. The Cloth Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers International Union was established in New York in 1901, as the United Cloth Hat and Cap Makers of North America (superseding the Cloth Hat and Cap Operators Union), and took its final name (adding Millinery Workers) in 1918. In 1983 the UHCMW joined the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, which in turn merged in 1995 with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to form UNITE (Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees).</field>
