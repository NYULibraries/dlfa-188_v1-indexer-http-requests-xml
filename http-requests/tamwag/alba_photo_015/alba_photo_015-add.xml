    <field name="abstract_teim">The organization Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) was begun informally in 1937 and officially in 1939 by U.S. volunteers returning from the Spanish Civil War. The VALB Photograph Collection contains photographic prints, slides and negatives collected by VALB, donated to the organization over the years, and occasionally used in their New York City offices for publicity purposes, exhibits, etc. The collection is comprised mostly of images of American volunteers in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, including portraits, group shots, and battlefield scenes; it also includes images of demonstrations, support activities, and commemorative events in the United States. There are some photographs of volunteers of other nationalities, of supporters and relatives of the U.S. volunteers, and of prominent individuals such as Paul Robeson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as well as images documenting the volunteers' activities in more recent years, including Lincoln Brigade veterans' trips to Spain, Nicaragua, the People's Republic of China, and East Germany.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Photograph Collection was compiled from photographs, slides, and negatives produced by, gathered by, or donated to VALB over the course of its history. Some of the images were donated by veterans and their families or acquired from individuals engaged in filmmaking, journalism, research or publication projects. For the most part, caption information has been taken from notations on the photographs, with minimal editing. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: Photographic Prints. This series contains ca. 2,000 photographs collected by VALB and used in its New York City offices. The series consists mainly of images of American volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, and includes portraits, group shots, combat scenes, and images of demonstrations and support activities in the United States after the Spanish Civil War including protests against the Vietnam War. Dates are provided or estimated when possible. Series I is divided into four subseries, Subseries A: Individuals, is comprised of photographs of portraits and groups in which each individual is identified; Subseries B: Individuals in Groups, includes photographs of larger groups of people in which only one or a few are identified; Subseries C: Subjects, General, includes photographs taken at particular sites as well as images grouped by topic. Subject designations for the most part match those used in the original photo captions; Subseries D: Monuments, Memorials, Celebrations, and Reunion, includes photographs of memorial gatherings, commemorations, reunions and other veterans' events, as well as demonstrations and other political activities in which veterans and their supporters participated. Also included in this series are a few photographs of political notables and other subjects of general political interest.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Negatives, consist of 204 negative images of U.S. volunteers in the Spanish Civil War (including portraits, group shots, and combat scenes) and of support activities in the United States. All of the negatives have matching prints in the collection; the negative sleeves are marked with the item number of the corresponding print. (Negative numbers are also noted on sleeves or folders of their matching prints.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III: Slides. The 8 slides in this series are images of a 1974 VALB trip to China.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IV: Unprocessed Material, consists of a large number of miscellaneous photographs donated to the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, or acquired by them for publications, exhibits, etc. but never integrated into this collection. The exact provenance of most of the photographs is unknown. Many folder titles are general; they include any available donor information.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">U.S. men and women who had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War joined together as the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) in December 1937 upon their return from Spain. The organization adopted a constitution and a formal structure in 1939. VALB originally assisted wounded veterans and sought to awaken the U.S. public to the significance of the Spanish Civil War and the Loyalist cause. In later years, VALB campaigned strenuously against the Franco regime in Spain and addressed other political issues, including U.S. policy in World War II and later, in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Vietnam. In addition to their headquarters in New York City, VALB "posts" developed in various cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. VALB also created a journal/newsletter, The Volunteer for Liberty (later, The Volunteer). For additional information on the history of VALB see the guide to the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Records, ALBA #19.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The VALB Photograph Collection was donated to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives by VALB in the early 1990s. Additional images came to VALB and were passed on to the Archives in later years. The core collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University.</field>
