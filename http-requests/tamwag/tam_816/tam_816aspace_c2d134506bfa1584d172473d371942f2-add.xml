    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Narrator 010 discusses working in the mess hall during his incarceration and how the
prison often cut back on portions and particular meals, which forced people to spend their money at the
commissary store. He recounts price increases and product shortages at commissary, and talks about the
help he received from his family, particularly his wife, in the form of money and packages. He explains
that "side hustles" and participation in the prison informal economy are what help incarcerated people
afford basic necessities, but that either could result in accrued debt and violent retaliation from other
prisoners. This interview sheds light on the financial difficulty of surviving inside prison and how the
informal economy is a lifeline to incarcerated individuals while also creating the potential for debt and
violence.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Narrator 010 was born and raised in New York City. In October 2019, after serving 15 years in New York
State prisons, he moved back to the Bronx, working as a harm reduction specialist in the borough. He
described his job as "saving lives, every day." He hoped to continue working in this field in the future,
and at the time of the interview he was pursuing a Master's degree in Social Work.</field>
