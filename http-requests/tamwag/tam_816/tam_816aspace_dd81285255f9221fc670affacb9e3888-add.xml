    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Narrator 114 discusses how he relied on his family to send him money in order to
purchase items at the prison commissary, the initial delays he struggled with when it came to receiving his
money, and that he did not know how commissary worked nor which essentials to buy. He explains that,
although his jobs inside prison only paid cents per hour, he was able to benefit from certain perks in each
role, including collecting and selling contraband. In addition, Narrator 114 sold tobacco and purchased
drugs in the prison informal economy. This interview sheds light on the function of the informal economy
inside prison, the importance of outside support, and the benefits of certain jobs.</field>
