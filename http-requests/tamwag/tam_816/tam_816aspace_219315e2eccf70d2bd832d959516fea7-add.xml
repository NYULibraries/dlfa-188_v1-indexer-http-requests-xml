    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Narrator 134 explains that he did not struggle financially in prison thanks to support
from his family members, friends, and girlfriends. They sent him packages with luxury items that were a
mark of his status inside prison, as well as money for commissary. He describes the economic hierarchy
inside prison, and how he would help out people in need, especially through his job as a porter and his
gang membership. In addition, he leveraged his job as a porter to make extra money by selling illicit
items within the prison and participated in the informal economy by gambling, reselling cigarettes, and
selling drugs. This interview sheds light on how prisons are often segregated by status, social standing,
ethnicity, and gang affiliation, as well as the ways specific jobs can facilitate trading through the informal
economy.</field>
