    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the course of this group discussion, five members of NYU's Prison Education Program (PEP) reflect on
their transition from prison inmates and students to their training as student researchers in the PEP
Research Lab. They trade their experiences of life on the inside, debunking a variety of public myths
about the welfare and treatment of those caught within the prison system. Discussing their post-carceral
roles as students and researchers, they analyze the differences between the two, drawing particular
attention to the social status accorded to researchers. Building on the independence and resources offered
by PEP's Research Lab, they describe the initiatives they have taken to launch new paths of inquiry into
carceral life and the financial and social burdens that continue to afflict formerly incarcerated on reentry.</field>
