    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Narrator 326 discusses JPay and how the corporation took advantage of incarcerated
people and their isolation during the pandemic. He recounts how the few promotional benefits they
offered such as free stamps and messages encouraged more spending as incarcerated people had no other
means of communicating with loved ones during lockdown. The lack of recreation, visitation, and mail all
led to a dramatic increase in tablet usage for both communication and entertainment, thus increasing
profits for JPay. This interview sheds light on the predatory, profit-driven nature of JPay's services and
how incarcerated people are often taken advantage of financially by such corporations, particularly
during a tumultuous time like the COVID-19 pandemic.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Narrator 326 was in his mid-thirties at the time of this interview. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Narrator
326 lived in all the five boroughs, and in Westchester county. He returned to the Bronx in February 2021,
after spending approximately 13 years in New York State prisons. When we met him, he was working as a
porter cleaning buildings in the South Bronx and on construction sites. At the time, he said he was barely
making ends meet and did not feel very optimistic that his financial situation would improve in the near
future.</field>
