    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Narrator 122 discusses how he had to budget, prioritize certain items at commissary
buys, and would only purchase the cheap essentials that last a long time. He explains that incarcerated
people have to rely on outside support systems, which often includes family members, because most of the
food served at the mess hall is low quality and not enough to survive on. He recalls receiving food
packages from his mother, which were meaningful to him because they are extremely expensive,
time-consuming to put together, and strictly regulated by prisons. He also explains the importance of
friendship inside prison in terms of sharing food items and splitting up tasks like cooking and cleaning.
Narrator 122 describes how stamps and cigarettes function like currency in the informal economy and
can be exchanged for snacks and other items. This interview sheds light on the necessity of outside
support, the cost and bureaucracy that goes into receiving that support, and the purpose of the informal
economy in filling gaps for people who do not have outside help.</field>
