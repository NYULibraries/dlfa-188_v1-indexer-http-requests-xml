    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview, Narrator 132 discusses how he had to survive on the bare minimum while he was
incarcerated due to a lack of funds. He purchased necessities at the commissary store with the little
money he made from his state job. He got by, by exchanging food he took from the mess hall for stamps or
cigarettes, which functioned as forms of currency, or for other food items he needed. Narrator 132 also
went to "stores" or "jugglers" and racked up a small amount of debt in order to buy snacks and other
items. He explains that many other people inside were struggling like him and could not afford to max out
at commissary. This interview sheds light on the function of jobs inside prison in facilitating exchanges
through the informal economy, which allow incarcerated people to scrape by.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Narrator 132 was born and raised in the eastern towns of Long Island, New York. Growing up, he was an
outgoing, adventurous, and very curious kid. Narrator 132 was incarcerated for 13 years, and started his
educational journey in his twelfth year in prison. At the time of the interview, he was pursuing his B.A. and
working as a multimedia artist and visual storyteller.</field>
