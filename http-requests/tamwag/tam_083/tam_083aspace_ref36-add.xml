    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries B: Correspondence contains two sub-subseries: alphabetical and chronological. Leyda's earliest professional mentors Ralph Steiner and Julian Levy are included with his Dayton friends, dancer Josephine Schwarz and artist Jack Rau. Lincoln Kirstein is a lifelong correspondent of Leyda's along with his sister Mina Curtiss. Leyda's connection with the Museum of Modern Art began long before he was hired there, and is evidenced in his correspondence with Alfred Barr and members of the Rockefeller family. There is also a thick MOMA correspondence file. His early liaison with activist attorney Carol King brought him in contact with the likes of Joseph and Charmian Freeman, and his involvement in founding the Film and Photo League introduced him to Romana Javitz of the New York Public Library's circulating picture collection. Most of the era's literary and film world personalities corresponded with Jay at one time or another. Important and/or frequent correspondents include: James Agee, Walter Benjamin, Paul Bowles, Luis Bunuel, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Aaron Copeland, Joseph Cornell, Walker Evans, Helga Greene, Langston Hughes, Joris Ivens, Paul Jarrico, Elia Kazan, Carol King, Naum Kleiman, Fritz Lang, Joseph Losey, Albert Maltz, Ivor Montagu, Man Ray, Satyajit Ray, Abby Rockefeller, Muriel Rukeyser, Georges Sadoul, Gilbert Seldes, Marie Seton, Lee Strasberg, Thornton Wilder, and Edmund Wilson. Also included is Leyda's correspondence with his family, including his mother, Margaret Smith, grandmother Margaret Leyda, maternal aunts Mary and Josephine Leyda, and his half sister Jane Smith and her family.</field>
