The Rose Weiner Papers (dated 1920-1995) contain photographs, correspondence, and personal items related to Rose Weiner's life and her work as a nurse during the Spanish Civil War. The bulk of these materials were contained in Weiner's personal scrapbook, which contained photographs of Weiner in her youth, Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers during the Spanish Civil War, and Weiner's family later in life. Also included in these materials are nursing certificates, a small amount of personal correspondence, and letters from the American Red Cross and War Manpower Commission regarding her application to serve as a nurse during World War II.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Rose Weiner Papers (dated 1920-1995) contain photographs, correspondence, and personal items related to Rose Weiner's life and her work as a nurse during the Spanish Civil War. The bulk of the materials in this collection were originally housed in a scrapbook. The scrapbook was dismantled, but photocopies of the intact scrapbook are included in the collection. Items contained in the scrapbook largely consisted of photographs of Weiner in her youth, Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers during the Spanish Civil War, and Weiner's family later in life. It also contained nursing certificates, a small amount of personal correspondence, and letters from the American Red Cross and War Manpower Commission regarding her application to serve as a nurse during World War II. 
Materials added to the collection in 2017 include collected publications related to Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers and medical staff in Spain during the civil war. They also include photocopies of correspondence between Weiner and Fredericka Martin (dated 1969), and a photograph of Weiner in a white nursing uniform (dated circa 1928).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rose Weiner (1908-1995) was born in Lyubar, Russia into a Jewish family. As a child Rose experienced the harsh conditions of the Russian Revolution and counter-revolution while she, her mother and siblings awaited word from her father who had migrated to the United States. On September 25, 1921, Rose and her family arrived at the Port of New York before moving to Milwaukee. Weiner moved back to New York for school and attended the Montefiore Hospital School of Nursing from 1929-1932. After graduation, Weiner accepted a position at Montefiore Hospital. In March 1937 she sailed to Spain as an American medical volunteer in support of the Loyalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. Weiner worked as a floor nurse in a convalescent hospital, of which she was soon given charge. She spent several months working on the front lines before taking charge of a surgical hospital. During her last six months in Spain, she served as chief nurse of a 1,500-bed surgical and medical hospital.
Weiner returned to New York in 1939 and continued work at Montefiore Hospital. Although she applied for nursing positions in the American Red Cross, Army Nurse Corps and War Manpower Commission during WWII, Weiner was never granted any of these positions, on the grounds that she did not meet physical requirements. Soon after her attempts to serve in the war, Weiner left Montefiore and began work for New York City as a Public Health Nurse. Meanwhile, she worked toward her Bachelor of Science degree at Hunter College. Weiner later worked as a school nurse until she retired in the 1970s.</field>
