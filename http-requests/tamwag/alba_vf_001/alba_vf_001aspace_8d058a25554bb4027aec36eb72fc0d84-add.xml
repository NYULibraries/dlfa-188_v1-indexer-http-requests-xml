    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA) is dedicated to preserving and communicating the history and memory of those Americans who participated in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side ("volunteers"). It is also successor to the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. The website was first collected in 2008 and contained history of the war and the veterans organizations; dgitized documents, audio, images, and video related to the volunteers; a database of the volunteers with biographies; exhibit catalogs; online lesson plans for teaching about the Spanish Civil War; the San Francisco Monument; book reviews; events; ALBA in the news; George Watt Essay Contest; Teaching Institutes; and information about the ALBA collections at the Tamiment Library. Overtime, content on the website increased to include online resources of other institutions with Abraham Lincoln Brigade collections; a glossary; ALBA's Robeson in Spain comic book; publications on the Abraham Lincoln Brigade; fundraising efforts; ALBA/Puffin Award for Human Rights Activism; Human Rights Documentary Film Festival; obituaries; staff biographies; and the Susman lecture series. In early 2020, the website redesigned. Additional projects documented on the website include information on the Jarama Society; "Invisible Heroes: African Americans in the Spanish Civil War" documentary; the Perry Rosenstein Cultural Series; annual galas; and the Good Fight fundraising campaign.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">They also publish the quarterly journal, The Volunteer. Capture of the Volunteer's website began in 2010. The journal covers interviews, essays, obituaries, book reviews and other reviews, videos, research news, exhibitions, Tamiment Library updates, the Passport project and other database updates, speeches and presentations, the history of progressive activism, letters to the editor, current events interpreted through the lens of the Spanish Civil War, and other news related to the Spanish Civil War and the volunteers. Back issues of the Volunteer on the website date back to 1938.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The YouTube Channel contains videos related to virtual events and galas put on by ALBA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Topics include the memorial for Judy Montell, fundraising videos, Question and Answer panels on books and films related to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Memorial and Veterans Days tributes; Susman Lectures; other lectures; and monument commemorations. </field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Crawl was limited to domains and subdomains of alba-valb.org and albavolunteer.org in order to remain within the collection scope and data constraints.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">YouTube Channel was added to attempt to capture the videos embedded in the website. In 2023, YouTube URLs were changed to better capture the videos on the channel.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content.
