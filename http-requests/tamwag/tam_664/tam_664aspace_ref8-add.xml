    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Documents in this series include passports (which document Treuhaft's travels as early as the summer of 1937 when he visited England, France and Italy, as well as, Austria, Germany and Hungary, as well as later travels to England, Hungary, Portugal, and the Soviet Union),  report cards and grades from elementary school as well as for Harvard University, class notes for an evidence class at Harvard Law School, announcements and notes for a 50th reunion of his Harvard class about which he wrote an article in The Nation; copies of his FBI and CIA "files" obtained through FOIA requests.  Correspondence and receipts in the "red-baiting" folders (as they were originally labeled by Treuhaft or his office staff) document extensively his efforts to defend himself from attempts to dismiss him from his job at the Office of Price Adminstration on political grounds.  These same files contain numerous newspaper clippings, leaflets and publications report on the course of much of his political activity, albeit often in a biased or distorted manner, including accusations and attacks in the right-wing press and a scurrilous newsletter from a local Communist Party group; even an insurance claim that documenting what may have be a politically motivated deliberate damage to Treuhaft's automobile.</field>
