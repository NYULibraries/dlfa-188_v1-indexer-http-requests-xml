    <field name="abstract_teim">Roberta Wood (1949-) has served as Secretary Treasurer of the Communist Party since 2007. A lifelong rank and file union activist, Roberta co-founded the steelworker women's caucus in the in the Chicago/Gary district of the Steelworkers union. In 1976 she was elected the first female member of USWA Local 65's Executive Board. Following the closing of US Steel's South Works mill, Roberta worked until retirement as an electrical instrumentation mechanic in a municipal sewage treament facility. She served several years as labor editor of the People's Weekly World, forerunner to the People's World. The Roberta Wood Papers consists of materials collected by Wood over the course of her decades of labor organizing and political activism. Much of the collection documents Wood's early communist activism, with particular emphasis on her work with the Young Workers Liberation League (YWLL). Included in her YWLL records are fliers, publications, organizing documents, and meeting notes and minutes. This collection also includes Wood's notes from a party-related political education program/workers school; documentation from Wood's involvement in the Coalition of Labor Union Women; documents from her time organizing with the CPUSA's Southern California District; and notes and slides from the World Assembly of Builders of Peace Meeting in Warsaw, Poland in 1977; as well as documents given to her by Al Hanover and leftist ephemera and publications. Materials also include financial statements, publicity, and planning materials from the Labor Education Fund's tribute for Florence Reece and the Ernesto De Maio Tribute Committee's tribute for Ernie De Maio, both in the 1970s. The collection also contains an oral history with Wood conducted in 2012, and biographies of numerous leaders in the labor, civil rights, and peace movements, collected for the Unity Center's (likely unpublished) Honor Roll and Golden Book of the Working Class.</field>
