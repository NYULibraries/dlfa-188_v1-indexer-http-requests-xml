    <field name="abstract_teim">Mortimer Daniel Rubin (1931-2015) was a prominent member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). He held many leadership positions in the Communist Party including National Youth Secretary, National Organizational Secretary, Head of the Department of Economic and Social Rights, and Education Secretary. His papers provide a broad view of Rubin's political life and his work within the Communist Party, documenting how his personal and intellectual life were heavily intertwined with his political activism. They consist of national Communist Party administrative files documenting his leadership position within the Party, including correspondence, meeting minutes, memoranda, bulletins, notes, drafts of essays and official Party statements, educational course outlines, and collected articles and pamphlets. The collection also contains files related to Rubin's split from the CPUSA in 1991 and his involvement in the creation of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Daniel Rubin Papers (dated 1940s-2015) provide a broad view of Daniel Rubin's political life and his work within the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). Daniel Rubin's papers document how his personal and intellectual life were heavily intertwined with his political activism, and in particular his work for the Party. Most well represented among his papers are files from Rubin's work as National Organizational Secretary and his work with national organizational bodies of the Party such as the National Committee and the National Board. Also well represented in his papers are correspondence, reports, and organizing files related to his leadership of the Youth Commission, the Economic and Social Rights Commission, and the Education Department. The collection also contains files related to Rubin's split from the CPUSA in 1991 and his involvement in the creation of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Other files document Rubin's work after he renewed his Communist Party membership in 2000. During that time, Rubin worked to strengthen the CPUSA's Brooklyn Club and served as a member of the New York District Executive Committee and the CPUSA National Committee. These materials consist of National Party correspondence, minutes, memoranda, bulletins, notes, drafts of essays and official Party statements, educational course outlines, and collected articles and pamphlets. Rubin was deeply also interested in the history of Judaism and communism, and his papers dated after 1991 include extensive research files on international Jewish issues and the role of Jews in Communist Party.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mortimer Daniel Rubin (1931-2015) was a prominent member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). Rubin was born in Philadelphia, PA in 1931. Better known as Daniel Rubin, he was raised in a Jewish, communist household and involved in progressive and communist activism from an early age. In 1947 he joined the Progressive Citizens of America and was founding member of the Young Progressives of America. He attended Swarthmore College where he joined Citizens for a Free City College, as well as American Youth for Democracy, a Communist Party affiliated youth organization. He began law school at University of Pennsylvania in 1953 and in that year became one of three members in the Eastern-Pennsylvania Labor Youth League. Rubin attended his first CPUSA convention in 1956 as a delegate to the 16th National Convention. In that year, he became a board member of the CPUSA's Philadelphia district and the district's Youth Secretary. In 1959 Rubin was elected to the National Committee of the CPUSA and invited to move to New York to become the organization's National Youth Secretary, a position he held until 1964. Rubin became the Party's National Organizational Secretary in 1964, a position he held until 1974. Rubin was deeply involved in CPUSA national work until 1991, serving as head of the Department of Economic and Social Rights from 1974 to 1980, and Educational Director from 1981 to 1992. Following the 1991 National Convention, Rubin and several other prominent members split from the Party and formed the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Rubin renewed his membership with CPUSA in 2000 and remained an active member until his death in 2015. During these years his work focused primarily on club and district organizing in Brooklyn and New York State.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Purchased from Daniel Rubin in 2014; additional materials were purchased from Dorothoy Rubin in 2016. The accession numbers associated with these gifts are 2014.168 and 2015.010.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Approximately 12 boxes of newspaper clippings files, periodicals, and collected articles were removed from the collection. Clippings were largely from trade publications and held little research value, while publications included copies of Communist Party produced periodicals and publications from related organizations that are already included in the Tamiment Library's serials collections. An additional 14 boxes of books and pamphlets that duplicated materials already in Tamiment's holding were also deaccessioned. </field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">A small amount of financial records and receipts were also removed from the collection. These items contained personal financial information and contained limited research value.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Additionally, several boxes containing printed out emails and online articles related to local New York City politics from the early 2000s were weeded by the archivist and bulk emails from political campaigns and progressive listservs were deaccessioned. Only the emails that documented Rubin's direct involvement with these campaigns were retained. These included emails directly addressed to Rubin, or discussion list conversations in which Rubin participated.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Other materials removed from the collection include duplicate buttons, lapel pins, duplicates audio tapes of the Gus Hall program Update, and an off-air recording of an episode of NPR's All Things Considered.</field>
