    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains flyers, correspondence, agendas, pamphlets, publications, as well as Rubin's notes and drafts, which document his work with the Communist Party's Youth Commission and affiliated youth organizations, including the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs, Labor Youth League, Progressive Youth Organizing Committee, Young Communist League, and Young Workers Liberation League, dated 1940s-1980s. Files related to Rubin's work with youth organizations, notably his work at Swarthmore College and involvement in the American Youth for Democracy (AYD) and Labor Youth League (LYL) predate his membership in the Communist Party. While the AYD and LYL were Communist Party affiliated organizations, Rubin's files on these organizations specifically relate to youth organizing in the Philadelphia area. The bulk of the series document Rubin's work as National Youth Secretary, but also include Youth Commission materials dated after Rubin's work as Youth Secretary. These materials include reports, meeting minutes, outlines, educational guides, and publications related to the Youth Commission and affiliated organization, the Young Communist League and Young Workers Liberation League dated as late as 1990.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Daniel Rubin was raised in a communist household and was involved in progressive and communist activism from an early age. In 1947, he joined the Progressive Citizens of America and became a member of the Young Progressives of America. Around the same time, Rubin also joined the Philadelphia-based organization the Citizens for a Free City College, becoming the chair of the Youth Division and joined the Communist Party-affiliated American Youth for Democracy (AYD). As a student at Swarthmore College between 1949 and 1951, Rubin participated in Young Progressive for America political campaigns against McCarthyism, Cold War foreign policy, and segregation. He began law school at University of Pennsylvania in 1953 where he became a founding member of the Eastern Pennsylvania Labor Youth League (LYL). Between 1955 and 1960 Rubin began organizing for the Communist Party's Youth Club in Philadelphia, and served as a delegate to the 16th Convention of the Communist Party in 1956. He became the Party's National Youth Secretary in 1960, a position he held until the end of 1964.</field>
