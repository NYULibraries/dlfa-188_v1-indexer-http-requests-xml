    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series documents Daniel Rubin's political work after he split with the CPUSA in 1991. Files from the 1990s largely relate to his organizing work with the Committees of Correspondence (CoC) and include correspondence, flyers and position papers from the organization as well as legal brief and statements from a lawsuit between CoC members and the Communist Party. Papers dated after 2000, largely consist of correspondence, drafts of reports and essays, and collected articles related to Rubin's organizing work for both the CoC and the CPUSA. These materials primarily focus on Brooklyn Clubs and New York State regional organizing. The series includes approximately 1136 digital files related to Rubin's work with the both CPUSA and CoC organizing, dated 2006-2015. Other materials in this series include correspondence and petitions related to development of the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and resistance to the construction of the Barclay's Center stadium. The series also includes extensive research files on international Jewish issues and the role of Jews in Communist Party.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Born-digital records in this series consist of 3.5 gigabytes of emails, documents, and image files, which document Rubin's continued involvement in the CPUSA and his activism in local New York City politics. These files include drafts of Rubin's 2009 book, Can Capitalism Last: A Marxist Update; outlines, emails, and meeting notes from national, district, and local CPUSA organizing activities; and flyers, correspondence, and photos documenting Rubin's involvement in progressive political campaigns in Brooklyn and New York City. Rubin also saved biographical articles and obituaries honoring prominent Communist Party members. These biographical files include newspaper articles as well as transcripts of speeches honoring deceased Party members that Rubin collected for memorial events, the bulk of which are written about former Communist Party chairman Henry Winston.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Daniel Rubin left the Communist Party in 1991 along with many other Party members following political disagreements presented at the Party's 25th National Convention. Dissenting members formed the Committees of Correspondence, which later named the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Beginning in 1992, Rubin and several other former Communist Party members were sued by the Communist Party over the wills of Rachel Freidenberg and Rosalind Tratchenberg who had bequeathed money to individual Party members. Party leadership claimed that money bequeathed by Freidenberg and Tratchenberg were intended for Communist Party and disputed Rubin's and other former member's intention to donate funds to the Committees of Correspondence. The cases were eventually settled in the late 1990s. Rubin renewed his membership in the Communist Party in 2000 and remained an active member in the party until his death in 2015.</field>
