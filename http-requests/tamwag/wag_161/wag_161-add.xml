    <field name="abstract_teim">Ida Klaus (1905-1999) was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn and organized her first union as a teenager while working at a hotel in Saratoga Springs, NY. Klaus went on to work first for the National Labor Relations Board and then the New York City Department of Labor. Klaus was the author of the "Little Wagner Act," which gave city employees the right to organize and bargain collectively, and also wrote the first detailed code of labor relations for city employees. In the early 1960s Klaus negotiated the first citywide teachers' contract in the country on behalf of the New York City Board of Education.

The materials document Ida Klaus' work with labor unions as an arbitrator and attorney, primarily in New York City but also in other states and Puerto Rico. The collection is comprised of newsletters, briefs, manuscripts, newspaper clippings, drafts, transcripts of speeches, and research notes.</field>
