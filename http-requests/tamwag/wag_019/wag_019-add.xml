    <field name="abstract_teim">Sol Gorelick (1916-2004) was a social worker and union activist. He began his career with the City of New York in 1940 as a caseworker at the Brownsville Welfare Center. He would work with the city's welfare departments in Brooklyn until his retirement in 1980, also working at the Boro Hall Center and Fulton Center. The range of city documents maintained by Gorelick include memorandums, correspondence, procedural manuals, and educational materials. They document the city's bureaucratic culture, labor relations, unemployment, social  conditions, health and healthcare, and housing in mid-20th century Brooklyn.

Gorelick was a union member throughout his career with the city. His longest membership was with the Welfare Local 371 of AFSCME, District Council 37. He was a member during the union's tempestuous 1960s, which saw tense contract standoffs with the city, strikes, competition with the rival Social Service Employees Union, and the eventual merger of the two as the SSEU Local 371. Union materials include those documenting committee and chapter activities, negotiations, and recruitment.

Gorelick was also active in professional organizations and advocacy groups, including the National Association of Social Workers and the Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association. Documents from these organizations and others illustrate how a social worker's activism could span work, union, volunteer, and professional activities.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These papers document the career, labor activities, and activism of Sol Gorelick. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The largest series is comprised of documents from government entities concerned with social welfare. Most come from Gorelick's employer, the New York City Department of Human Resources, and its predecessors. These materials document the procedures and results of the city's welfare programs. The city's bureaucratic culture profoundly impacted its relationship with its employees and welfare clients. The resulting body of directives, memorandums, and correspondence show all facets of this experience. Because of welfare's relationship with other areas, the collection also illustrates unemployment, crime, and housing conditions in mid-20th century Brooklyn, with Brownsville being particularly well-represented.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Gorelick was a member of Social Service Employees Union, Local 371, which represented employees in the City of New York's welfare departments. A significant portion of the collection documents this local, its predecessor unions, and its parent union, AFSCME, District Council 37.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also gives insight into trends in the profession of social work, and shows how an individual's activism could span work, union activities, and professional organization participation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sol Gorelick (1916-2004) was a social worker and union activist. He began his career with the City of New York in 1940 as a caseworker at the Brownsville Welfare Center. After an absence to serve in World War II, Gorelick returned to the Department of Welfare. He would work with the department and its successor, the Human Resources Administration, until his retirement in 1980. Gorelick worked at several welfare (also termed income maintenance) centers in Brooklyn including the Boro Hall Center and the Fulton Center, for which he was director.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gorelick joined the United Public Workers union when he started with the city. Following the UPW's dissolution amid the CIO's anti-Communist purges, Gorelick would join the Welfare Local 371 (later the Social Service Employees Union Local 371) of AFSCME, District Council 37. During the 1960s Gorelick served as a vice president of DC 37.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gorelick was also active in many other profession organizations and advocacy groups, including the National Association of Social Workers and the Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Materials found in repository; provenance is unknown but were likely donated by Sol Gorelick in the late 1980s. The accession number associated with these materials is 1950.268.</field>
