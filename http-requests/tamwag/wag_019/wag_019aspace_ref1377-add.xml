    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Gorelick's involvement in community work and engagement with progressive causes went beyond his professional and union activities. This series documents additional organizations and subjects that Gorelick was involved with or monitored. Types include neighborhood and community organizations, social work professional organizations, nonprofit social service organizations, health and healthcare, politics, peace, and education.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association is particularly well represented. Gorelick was active in the leadership of the organization, and served as secretary and president. Materials are mostly from the 1970s and encompass the full range of organizational and informational documents, including correspondence, pamphlets, the In Short monthly newsletter, meeting minutes, audits, clippings, and documents from other organizations concerned with eliminating tuberculosis and smoking.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A notable amount of material documents activism in the United States opposed to Augusto Pinochet's 1973 coup in Chile. Social workers' professional organizations, unions, and groups throughout the left advocated for intervention to prevent human rights abuses. These materials contain publications, clippings, correspondence, and other material from groups concerned with the situation in Chile.</field>
