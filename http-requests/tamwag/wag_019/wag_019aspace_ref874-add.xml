    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains materials from Gorelick's tenure with the City of New York. It primarily consists of City of New York documents, but also contains information and instructions from state and federal social welfare departments. The series contains materials from the 1940s-1980s, but the bulk are from the 1960s-1970s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The City of New York was an extremely bureaucratic entity, an attribute that fundamentally shaped its labor relations with social service employees and the relationship between welfare clients and city employees. The memorandums, directives, and correspondence found here illustrate working conditions of social service employees and processes for administering welfare (also termed income maintenance). Because the need for welfare was connected with many other social issues, these records illustrate social conditions in mid-20th century New York City, including poverty, health, housing, employment, and crime.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Fulton Center, on Willoughby Street in Brooklyn, and the Boro Hall Center on Jay Street in Brooklyn are particularly well-represented. Gorelick held several positions at Boro Hall and was director at Fulton during the 1970s. The Brownsville Center is also represented to a lesser extent. These local centers were where clients interacted with the city's policies. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Departments are arranged alphabetically, but due to the evolution of the city government, similar functions are represented by content generated by different departments. The functions of the Department of Welfare would gradually be moved into the Department of Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services, which was created in 1966 and fully consolidated in 1970. The local centers, such as Fulton, Boro Hall, or Brownsville, were at times under the auspices of the Department of Welfare, the Department of Social Services, or the Human Resources Administration.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Advocacy and professional organizations for government employees are also included in this series. These include the Department of Welfare's branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Association of Supervisor's of the Department of Welfare. This group, formed "to advance professional growth and to protect the Civil Service rights of members," illustrates the often fine line between professional organization and union activities.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Sol Gorelick began his career with the City of New York in 1940 at the Brownsville Welfare Center and retired in 1980. During this time, the city's departments concerned with welfare (also termed income maintenance) and social services saw many reorganizations and policy changes based on the city's social conditions, forces within the government, and trends in the field of social work.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Consistent with national trends, New York City's government welfare programs were solidified as a result of the New Deal programs of the Great Depression. The 1935 Social Security Act included funds for unemployment and the Aid to Dependent Children program (later Aid to Families With Dependent Children). Funding came from the federal government and states. States and local governments administered the program.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By the 1940s, the Department of Welfare was one of many New York City government entities providing social services. In 1966, a merger of various social welfare agencies created the Human Resources Administration. While the Department of Welfare was included in the merger, its commissioner retained some autonomy from the Human Resources Administration until the positions of commissioner and administrator of the Human Resources Administration were finally merged in 1970.</field>
