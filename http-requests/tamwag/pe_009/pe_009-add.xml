    <field name="abstract_teim">The Printed Ephemera Collection on the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over several decades. Known more familiarly as the UAW, this union collection consists of contracts, agreements, and constitutions as well as printed ephemera, such as fliers, brochures, leaflets, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications. The materials range in date from the founding of the UAW in 1935 up to the present, spanning the various changes in affiliation the UAW had with both the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In addition to the international and national body of the UAW, the collection contains printed material from UAW locals, notably the Detroit and Flint Michigan automobile plants, as well as materials from rank and file activity from around the United States.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United Automobile Workers of America (UAW) was founded in 1935, and over the next few years changed its affiliation from the American Federation of Labor to that of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. In 1937, the UAW gained recognition from the General Motors Corporation with its use of the dramatic sit-down strike, employed as both a bargaining tool and an organizing method. Membership skyrocketed following these heroic organizing campaigns and recognition was gained from the major auto manufacturing companies. In 1941, the UAW changed its name to the International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, and later in 1962, it changed the "Aircraft" to "Aerospace", though today the union is still familiarly known as the UAW. Walter Reuther served as president from 1946 until 1970 when he and his wife died tragically in an airplane crash. As of 2009, the UAW had roughly 513,000 active members and more than 575,000 retired members in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. There were more than 800 local unions within the UAW with over 3,100 contracts.</field>
