    <field name="abstract_teim">Radio Bandung was a weekly radio newsmagazine from 1991 through the late 1990s that aimed to deliver news and cultural information about Asian/Pacific/American communities and the Asian/Pacific geographic region to the general public. Domestic topics covered on the program included anti-immigration hearings, South Asian taxi drivers in New York City, the Native Hawaiian independence movement, and LGBTQ rights. International issues included AIDS activism in Southeast Asia, new film movements in China and Vietnam, and redress efforts over the forced sexual slavery of Korean women and girls by the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II (euphemistically referred to as "comfort women"). The Radio Bandung Collection (dated 1986-1998) consists of materials documenting the program's regular activities, including typed and handwritten logs for individual programs, including show outlines, edit scripts, names of specific guests, and topics discussed; grant applications, grant progress reports, and other financial records; and materials related to Radio Bandung's workshop series to teach media skills to community members, including session outlines, equipment sign-out sheets, and technical manuals for radio production equipment. The collection also includes materials concerning the production of the documentary Silent Decades: Chinatown and McCarthyism, including press kits, drafts and transcripts in various stages, and editing documents. The collection documents the specific Radio Bandung program, as well as Asian/Pacific/American experiences concerning racism, discrimination, immigration, and ethnic identity. The collection demonstrates an effort from within the Asian/Pacific/American community to represent and analyze these community experiences.</field>
