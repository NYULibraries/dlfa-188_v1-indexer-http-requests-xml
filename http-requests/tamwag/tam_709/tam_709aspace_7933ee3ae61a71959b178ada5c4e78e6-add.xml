    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Jeff Kisseloff. In this two-part interview Agnese Haury talks about working at the United Nations (UN) and her friendship with Alger Hiss. Haury begins the interview with a discussion about her background, and the events that led her to begin working as an editor at the United Nations. She talks about working with Hiss during the early days of the UN, and discusses how staff at the UN viewed the Hiss trials. In the first interview she describes attending several of the trial proceedings, and talks generally about Hiss's initial reaction to the allegations. The second part of the interview focuses more on Hiss's personal relationships. She shares a story about taking Hiss's wife Priscilla and his son Tony to Lewisburg prison following his conviction, and discusses providing the family with financial support. She also talks at some length about Hiss and his brother Donald, and concludes the interview with a discussion about Hiss during the last years of his life.</field>
