    <field name="bioghist_teim">Joseph Selligman Jr. was born on December 25, 1916 in Louisville Kentucky to Esther and Joseph Selligman. He was the second of three children; his elder sister Augusta was born in 1913, and his younger sister Lucy was born in 1920. His mother, the former Esther Rosenberg, taught kindergarten before her marriage to Joseph Selligman Sr. in 1909. His father worked as a lawyer in partnership with his brother Alfred and was also prominent in local politics.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Joseph Selligman Jr. attended Louisville Male High School for three and a half years, graduating early in 1933. He then enrolled in Swarthmore College, a Quaker school in Pennsylvania, at the age of 16 in the fall of 1933. At Swarthmore Selligman wrote for the school's literary magazine and later became the editor and served on the debate team. In the summer of 1935 Selligman also participated in a Quaker Peace Caravan in Iowa, which promoted peace and non-violent resistance along with other Swarthmore students. In October of his senior year Selligman applied to Harvard for graduate work in philosophy, but in mid-December he left Swarthmore without his parents' knowledge and traveled to Europe to join the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In an attempt to convince him to return Selligman's father sent his law partner, Joseph Everhart, to Paris, where he had last been heard from. By the time Everhart arrived, however, Selligman had already left for Spain. In Europe, Selligman initially tried to enlist under his own name but was rejected because he was only nineteen years old. He instead enlisted in a British battalion under the name Frank Neary, who was a young Irishman who sold his enlistment papers to Selligman after changing his mind about going to war. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Selligman entered Spain sometime in late December or early January. By mid-February he was fighting with a British battalion of the International Brigade along the Jarama River. At the battle of Jarama he suffered a head wound and was evacuated to a hospital near Madrid where he died two weeks later. His family believes he was the first American casualty of the Spanish Civil War.</field>
