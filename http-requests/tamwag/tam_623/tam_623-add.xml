    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents Samuel Zagat's career as a cartoonist and more generally illustrates the efforts of an American cartoonist working in Yiddish.  The collection contains photographs, original drawings, negatives (presumably taken from the screen of a microfilm reader), contact prints of negatives, newspaper clippings, and photocopies of Zagat's cartoons from the 1910s through the 1960s.  The majority of the materials are from the 1940s and 1950s.  Major subjects include labor relations, anti-Semitism, Cold War diplomacy, Israel and the Middle East, and humorous aspects of daily Jewish life.  A substantial portion of Zagat's cartoons contain Yiddish captions; the majority of materials in this collection have supplied English translations.</field>
