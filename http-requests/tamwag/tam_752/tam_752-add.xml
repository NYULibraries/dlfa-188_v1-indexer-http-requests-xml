    <field name="abstract_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of LGBTQ Rights Serials groups 41 titles broadly relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) rights, published between 1969 and 2001, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, magazines, and bulletins, with a smaller quantity of one-off reports and catalogs, published by LGBTQ rights organizations, encompassing activist networks, academic institutions, and nonprofits. The serials provide contemporaneous coverage of a wide range of issues of concern to LGBTQ communities between the 1970s and 1990s, broadly addressing sexuality, gender, anti-gay violence and discrimination, health, and cultural portrayals of the LGBTQ community.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of LGBTQ Rights Serials groups 41 titles broadly relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) rights, published between 1969 and 2001, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections.

The serials provide contemporaneous coverage of a wide range of issues of concern to LGBTQ communities between the 1970s and 1990s, broadly addressing sexuality, gender, anti-LGBTQ violence and discrimination, health, and cultural portrayals of the LGBTQ community.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Among the topics addressed in the serials are sexuality, gender, anti-LGBTQ violence and legislation, housing and workplace discrimination, HIV/AIDS, gay pride demonstrations, arts, media, and the role of LGBTQ people within other political movements. Serials address LGBTQ rights in a variety of social movements including organized labor, peace activism, socialism, and anarchism and address the specific issues LGBTQ members of those communities faced. Local and regional serials include news and announcements related to demonstrations, local events, hate crimes, cases of discrimination, and state and municipal regulations. Serials in this collection were predominantly published in the United States by local and regional activist organizations. The bulk were published in New York, but publications from California, Washington, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Michigan are also present.
 
Serials in this collection do not provide much information on international LGBTQ issues, and only include a small number of international publications from the United Kingdom and Canada. Likewise, topics related to transgender rights and transgender communities are limited in this collection, as the bulk of periodicals were largely produced by lesbian and gay rights groups between the 1970s and 1990s.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">This collection combines serials relating to LGBTQ Rights drawn from two discrete groups of material held by the Tamiment Library. The first was a partially inventoried backlog of serials, received by the library through donations, subscriptions, and in archival collections. The second group consisted of around 1,700 serials, newspapers, and magazines, organized by title as an artificial collection, referred to as Periodicals.001 or Boxed Newspapers. This material was combined, inventoried, and arranged and described in subject-based categories in 2017. The accession number related to this collection is 2017.049.</field>
