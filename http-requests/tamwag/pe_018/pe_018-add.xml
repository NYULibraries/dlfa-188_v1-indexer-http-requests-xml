    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains materials from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Stablemen and Helpers of America, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America (IBTCW&amp;H).  Locals may appear under both IBT and IBTCW&amp;H.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files consist of agreements, constitutions, fliers and publications put out by locals as well as the union at large. Two sets of rosters, one for IBT and one for IBTCW&amp;H are included. Most of the materials date from the 1950s-1980s. Several locals are represented, often by fliers or constitutions and agreements.  Teamsters for a Democratic Union are represented in two files and were an important impetus to rid the Teamsters of corrupt practices.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) was formed in 1903 by the merger of several regional locals of teamsters, individuals who drove teams of animals, such as oxen or horses, and wagons.  The union today represents a diverse membership of blue-collar and professional workers in both the public and private sectors as is evident by the various locals included in the collection, such as Ice Cream Drivers and Employees, Local 757 and Armored Car Chauffeurs and Guards, Local 820. Currently known by the name International Brotherhood of Teamsters, IBT was also briefly known as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Stablemen and Helpers of America and later and more popularly, as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America.  The collection consists mainly of materials from the latter.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Materials in this collection have been compiled by the Tamiment Library. There is no accession record associated with this collection.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The Tamiment Library, New York University, a special collection documenting the history of United States radicalism, labor, and progressive social action, accumulated this artificial collection of printed ephemera gradually over the years through purchases, donations, standing orders with publishers, organizations, and bookstores, and through exchanges with other special library collections and by ongoing collecting by staff.</field>
