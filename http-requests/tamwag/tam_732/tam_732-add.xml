    <field name="abstract_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Environmentalism Serials collection groups 241 titles broadly relating to environmentalism, published between 1940 and 2004, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, magazines, and bulletins published by environmental organizations, encompassing activist networks, research bodies, conservation groups, government agencies, independent farms and co-operatives, and non-profits and charities addressing various causes. The serials provide contemporaneous coverage of a wide range of issues of concern to environmentalists, broadly addressing ecological conditions and the various threats to a stable ecosystem; featuring reports on green initiatives, legal actions, and scientific findings; and providing guidance on sustainable living. A significant quantity of the collection dates from the 1970s and 1980s, when interest in and literacy around environmental issues surged, chronicling early mainstream discourse around sustainability and climate change.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Environmentalism Serials groups 241 titles broadly relating to environmentalism, published between 1940 and 2004, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, magazines, and bulletins, with a smaller quantity of one-off reports and catalogs, published by environmental organizations, encompassing activist networks, research bodies, conservation groups, government agencies, independent farms and co-operatives, and non-profits and charities. A significant quantity of the collection dates from the 1970s and 1980s, when interest in and literacy around environmental issues surged, chronicling early mainstream discourse around sustainability and climate change. The serials provide contemporaneous coverage of a wide range of issues of concern to environmentalists, broadly addressing ecological conditions and the various threats to a stable ecosystem; featuring reports on green initiatives, legal actions, and scientific findings; and providing guidance on sustainable living. Among the topics addressed in the serials are pollution (from toxic waste, pesticides, CFCs); agriculture (large and small scale farming, organic produce, sustainability); new technologies (solar, transport, recycling); conservation (deforestation, land preservation, endangered species protection and animal welfare more generally); and environmental policy (regulation, land use and public space, energy policy governing coal and nuclear power). The serials also contain discussion of intersectionally related causes, like pacifism and human rights, as well as some of the ideas and movements pioneered by environmentalists, including discussion of appropriate technology, food justice, co-operative living and farming, and the broadly defined 'alternative lifestyle.' The vast majority of the collection originates in and documents the United States, with publishing bodies including established, international organizations, like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, as well as smaller, grassroots groups operating on a local scale, often addressing specific topics - new infrastructures of food supply in a city, or a local site subject to pollution or development - in service of coordinating a community response. The topics addressed within the serials are often small scale - for example providing resources to facilitate a sustainable home life - but communicate the broader priorities and philosophies of environmental activists, addressing appropriate technology, alternative economies, resource conservation, and global inequity. Among the titles contained in this collection are issues of Building Economic Alternatives, Green Action, Green Letter, Not Man Apart, and TRANET, as well as various publications of the National Audubon Society, Planet Drum Foundation, ALTERNATIVES! Foundation, and the Sierra Club. Many of the serials include significant information on affiliated environmental organizations, including directories for local groups and educational resources. No complete runs of publications are contained herein, and generally only a handful of issues of each publication are held.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">This collection combines serials relating to housing drawn from two discrete groups of material held by the Tamiment Library. The first was a partially inventoried backlog of serials received by the library through donations, subscriptions, and in archival collections. The second group consisted of around 1,700 serials, newspapers, and magazines, organized by title as an artificial collection, referred to as Periodicals.001 or Boxed Newspapers. This material was combined, inventoried, and arranged and described in subject-based categories in 2017. The accession number related to this collection is 2017.049.</field>
