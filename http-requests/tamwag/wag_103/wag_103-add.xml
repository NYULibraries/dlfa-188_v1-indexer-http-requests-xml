    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Metro Area Postal Union (American Postal Workers Union, Local 10) represents clerks, motor vehicle staff, maintenance workers and mail-handlers in the great New York City area. (Some mail-handlers, however, are represented by other unions.) By the 1980s the local enrolled more than 25,000 members. The local originated as Local 10 of the National Federation of Post Office Clerks. Officers and most of the members of this local seceded in 1958 to become the Postal Union of Manhattan-Bronx Clerks (later the Manhattan-Bronx Postal Union), with the aim of uniting many postal crafts in one industrial union. The local became part of the newly created American Postal Workers Union in 1971, after taking a leading role in the hard-fought national strike of postal workers in 1970. Under the dynamic presidencies of Moe Biller and Josie MacMillan from the 1958 through the 1980s, the local won significant gains for its members. Both the membership and the local union leadership became more diverse as post office jobs opened up to minorities and women as a result of civil rights initiatives of the 1960s.</field>
