    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Dorothy Hayden Cudahy Papers document the life and work of Dorothy Hayden Cudahy, dating from 1918 to 2010, with the bulk of material dating between the 1940s and the 1990s.  Materials include audio recordings, correspondence, print and born-digital photographs, writings and speeches, ephemera, clothing, and newspaper clippings.  These materials document Dorothy's professional and social accomplishments, in particular Dorothy's campaigns for and election as the first female St. Patrick's Day Parade Grand Marshall in 1989, her participation in Irish-American social organizations in New York City, and Dorothy's over 40 years as host of the Irish Memories radio program.  The audio recordings consist of approximately 2000 commercial audio recordings of Irish and Irish-American music, and recordings of Irish Memories from James Hayden's tenure as host as well as Dorothy's tenure.  The commercial audio recordings consist of 33 rpm, 45 rpm, 78 rpm grooved discs; printed inventories are available for the 33 rpm and 78 rpm recordings.  The recordings of the radio program consist of Fidelipac recordings, audiocassettes, and CDs, all of which have been transferred to access copies.  Other material documenting the weekly Irish Memories radio program includes playlists, administrative documents, and notes for interviews.  The correspondence consists of letters written to Dorothy regarding her candidacy for Grand Marshal of the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade in the 1980s, letters written by family and friends to Dorothy and John regarding personal topics, correspondence between John and others during his military service in World War II, and correspondence regarding the Irish Memories stage revue.  The newspaper clippings document Dorothy's election as the first female Grand Marshal of the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade in 1989, the Irish Memories stage revue and radio program, and John Cudahy's and James Hayden's articles written for Irish-American newspapers.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The print photographs document Dorothy's participation in social and political events in New York City, including meeting city government officials, being honored by the New York City and State governments, multiple New York City and other cities's St. Patrick's Day parades, Irish-American social organization events, and informal gatherings of family and friends.  There are photographs of Irish and Irish-American musicians collected by James Hayden and photographs of Dorothy Hayden's Irish Steppers.  There are five photograph collages, possibly created for Dorothy's wake or funeral, depicting mainly social events with some photographs from her early life and Dorothy with her husband, son, and her son's family.  The born-digital photographs consist of images of plaques commemorating the work and accomplishments of Dorothy and John.  Ephemera in the collection consists of plaques, booklets, postcards, holiday cards, sashes, a football, and event decorations.  The plaques commemorate the work and accomplishments of Dorothy and John.  The booklets document annual meetings and dinners for the Ancient Order of the Hibernians and the County Clare Patriotic and Benevolent Society Association.  The sashes read "Free Joe Doherty" and were worn at St. Patrick's Day parades by Dorothy and others to bring attention to the case of Joe Doherty, a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army who fought against extradition to Northern Ireland after being arrested and held in jail in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s.  The bulk of the writings and speeches consist of handwritten speeches given by Dorothy at various political and social events, in particular St. Patrick's Day parades and at Ancient Order of Hibernians committee meetings for planning the parades.  Other writings include drafts of newspaper articles written by John in the 1940s regarding soccer matches.  The clothing consists of the dress, coat, hat, and boots that Dorothy wore as Grand Marshal at the 1989 New York City St. Patrick's Day parade.</field>
