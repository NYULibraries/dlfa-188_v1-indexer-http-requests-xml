    <field name="abstract_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Labor Movement Serials groups 2,116 titles published between 1891 and 2012 mainly chronicling the labor movement in the 20th century, originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, bulletins, and mailings distributed by unions, national and local chapters of labor organizations, rank and file groups, government agencies, and advocacy groups. The serials document the activities of individual unions and organizations as well as the trajectory of the labor movement more broadly, with discussions on labor law and government policy, relationships and solidarity between affinity groups, and the concerns of particular constituencies of workers. Serials in this collection range from official publications and proceedings regularly distributed by large, AFL-CIO-affiliated organizations to pamphlets and printed matter informally circulated by organizers to announce meetings and actions. In addition to serials chronicling the labor movement in the United States, there are significant quantities of material relating to labor conditions in Europe and Canada.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, bulletins, and mailings distributed by unions, national and local chapters of labor organizations, rank and file groups, government agencies, and advocacy groups. The serials document the activities of individual unions and organizations -- meetings, elections, appointments, negotiations -- as well as the fluctuating trajectories of the labor movement more broadly, with discussions on labor law and government policy, relationships and solidarity between affinity groups, and the concerns of particular constituencies of workers. Serials in this collection range from official publications and conference proceedings regularly distributed by large, AFL-CIO-affiliated organizations to pamphlets and printed matter informally circulated by organizers to announce meetings and actions. Among the larger organizations represented in this collection are the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; the Communication Workers of America; the American Federation of Teachers; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; and Teamsters for a Democratic Union, as well as prominent labor coalitions in New York State like the United Federation of Teachers and the New York City Central Labor Council. Notable titles include American Postal Worker; Labor Chronicle; United Labor Action; United Teacher; Working Teamster; The NMU Pilot; Solidarity, issued by the Labor Committee of the New York Students for a Democratic Society; and the Philadelphia Workers' Organizing Committee's Organizer. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The trades and professions represented in this collection form a comprehensive cross-section of organized labor in the 20th century, encompassing bulletins from unions and rank and file groups representing the building trades, communications workers, public employees, transport employee unions, education and entertainment unions, farmworkers and longshoremen, retail and service workers, and coalitions representing demographics working across different sectors, for example the Jewish Labor Committee.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the material documenting the activities of unions in America, the collection also includes a series dedicated to labor research and history, and a collection of trade journals and labor newspapers. Around 300 titles originate from outside the United States, with significant quantities of Canadian and European publications, often representing international bodies or research groups discussing labor policy. No complete runs of publications are contained herein, and generally only a handful of issues of each publication are held.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">This collection combines serials relating to the labor movement drawn from two discrete groups of material held by the Tamiment Library. The first was a partially inventoried backlog of serials, received by the library through donations, subscriptions, and in archival collections. The second group consisted of around 1,700 serials, newspapers, and magazines, organized by title as an artificial collection, referred to as Periodicals.001 or Boxed Newspapers. This material was combined, inventoried, and arranged and described in subject-based categories in 2017.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">Due to the fragile nature of certain original materials, researchers may be required to consult microfilm copies, preservation photocopies, or digital images of material in this collection.</field>
