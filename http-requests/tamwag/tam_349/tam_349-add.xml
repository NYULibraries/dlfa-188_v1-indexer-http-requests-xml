    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The John Miller Papers on the Homeport Movement (dated 1981-1993) contain organizing materials and clippings related to John Miller's work with grassroots organizations opposing the U.S. Navy's Strategic Homeport Plan in the late 1980s. Miller worked with several organizations involved in the anti-homeport movement including Mobilization for Survival, the Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Harbor, the North Atlantic Network, and the National Campaign on Strategic Homeporting. Materials related to his involvement with all of these groups are included among his papers, and consist of correspondence, pamphlets, reports, and conference organizing materials related to efforts to raise opposition to the construction of naval ports.  A large portion of these materials relate specifically to the Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Harbor's efforts to resist the construction of a naval base in Staten Island. They also include two boxes of clippings related to both national and local homeporting campaigns.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">John Miller (born 1955) is a New York-based organizer and activist who worked with several organizations opposing the construction of strategic homeports around the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. Miller was an organizer in Mobilization for Survival (MFS), the Coalition for a Nuclear-Free Harbor (CNFH), and the North Atlantic Network (NAN). He was the coordinator for CNFH's Task Force on Nuclear Weapons Accidents, and served as editor for Mobilization for Survival's quarterly newsletter, The Mobilizer. He also contributed to the National Campaign on Strategic Homeporting. This campaign was formed at a 1987 meeting in Washington, D.C. by representatives from grassroots coalitions working to stop homeporting across the United States. The campaign and its affiliated groups lobbies against the construction of new naval homeports citing public health and safety concerns related to the housing of nuclear-capable naval vessels near major U.S. cities.</field>
