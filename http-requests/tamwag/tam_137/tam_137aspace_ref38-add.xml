    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains correspondence, clippings, flyers, press releases, pamphlets, speeches and reports. Arnold Johnson's Smith Act trial, he and his wife Aurelia's response to these proceedings and to the following years in jail, and the rally of support both for Johnson and against the Smith Act (the Citizens Emergency Defense Conference) are all well documented. The prison correspondence between Arnold and Aurelia Johnson is comprehensive, and although muted by prison regulations provides insight into Johnson's integrity of character, his unshaken beliefs in the freedom of speech and civil rights, and in the communist cause. The strength of the Johnsons' commitment to one another, and to their beliefs held in common, are also reflected in this correspondence. Other correspondence of particular interest is found in folders 6, 10 and 16. Folder 6 contains both the Johnson's reaction to the indictment in 1951. At the time of his arrest Arnold Johnson was representing the Civil Rights Congress in Pittsburgh. Johnson's christian socialist roots, his ability to maintain a dialog with those of different convictions, and the discomfort many outside the CP felt with the Smith Act proceedings, are all reflected in the positive response to his plight from inside and outside the Communist Party. Many with church associations responded to pleas for financial aid at risk to their own reputations. The letters from Marion C. Frenyear (pastor of a Congregational Church in South Hartford, NY), in particular, reflects this. Other principal correspondents include Aurelia Johnson, Elizabeth Hall (wife of Gus Hall), and Clifford T. McAvoy (Citizens Emergency Defense Conference - CEDC). There is 1 brief letter from W. E. DuBois amongst the CEDC correspondence. Prominent Communist Party correspondents include Eugene Davis (letter of thanks to Aurelia Johnson, 1955), and George A. Meyers (1955). The letter from Meyers describes his release from prison, and is quite detailed.</field>
