    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 2007 documentary Who Am I? provides a continuation of Estela Bravo's 1985 film, Missing Children, tracing the struggle of families of those disappeared during Argentina's "Dirty War" (1976-1983) to discover the fate of their loved ones and to recover the kidnapped children of those who were killed. This film centers on an organization of women known as the " Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo" who gained worldwide recognition for their weekly demonstrations in the center of Buenos Aires and their continued search for missing children. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The film includes interviews with the found children and with people who knew their parents, as well as trial footage related to the prosecution of individuals responsible for carrying out state-sponsored violence against political dissidents. Records in this series include a completed copy of the documentary, raw footage, and a press and promotional materials related to the release of the film.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">By the time Who Am I? was released in 2007, the number of found children was 88. A new version, released in 2014, provides updates to the story, including the discovery of "Grandchild 114" Guido, the grandson of Estela Carlotto. Carlotto was one of the founders and president of the Grandmothers del Plaza de Mayo and had been searching for her grandson for almost forty years.
