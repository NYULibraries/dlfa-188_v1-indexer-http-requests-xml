    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains full-length copies of The Cuban Excludables (1994), as well as interviews with a variety of individuals including US District Judge Marvin Shoob; Wayne Smith, former head the United States Interests Section in Havana; and Dennis (Denny) McLain, a former American baseball player who spent time in prison with the Cuban detainees. Other interviewees include lawyers and human rights activists, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and Coast Guard employees; correctional officers and other prison staff, and the detainees themselves, along with family members. Of particular interest are interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau, deputy warden and chief medical officer at the Atlanta Penitentiary where detainees were held. Interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau and Denny McLain were arranged and funded by 5th Estate Canadian Broadcasting System who used the footage for a period of time and then turned it over to the Bravos for their film.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In addition to the interviews, footage in this series contains news clips, footage from the prisons, interviews with the American families of some of the detainees, and scenes from Cuba, as the detainees arrived home and were reunited with their Cuban families. Walkiria Fernandez, an employee of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, appears in many of the clips with the detainees once they arrive in Cuba. Some of the material is duplicative and there is large amount of background footage and shots of leaving and arriving planes.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Estela and Ernesto Bravo filmed The Cuban Excludables after 1984 hearings, which granted the release of Cuban "excludable aliens" that had been indefinitely detained after serving prison sentences. The term "excludable alien" is a legal distinction that refers to immigrants or refugees who were not granted a path to citizenship because of criminal records. Approximately 2,500 of the Cubans who traveled to the United States during the Mariel Boatlift were given the "excludable" distinction and detained in American prisons. Estela and Ernesto Bravo interviewed detainees returning to Cuba and spoke with activists and attorneys involved in legal the battles. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1995, The Cuban Excludables won a Special Jury Prize at Cinefest, San Juan, Puerto Rico; and One World Award, Best Overseas Production on British TV, European Community BBC.</field>
