    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The John Vago Papers contain flyers, programs, photographs, slides, and video reels related to his work with the New York Marxist School and his travels to the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Switzerland. Vago served as the chairman of the Student Committee on Progressive Education and approximately half of the collection consists of New York School for Marxist Studies curriculum materials and flyers. These materials include course schedules and mailings related to course registration, flyers for lectures and events, and notes and outlines related to lectures between 1959 and 1968. The collection also contains travel documents, notes, photographs, and memorabilia from Vago's travels in Europe and the USSR. They document his travels to the Helsinki Youth Festival in 1962, Vago's travels to the Vienna World Youth Festival and Hungary in 1959 and 1962, and his travels to Mongolia in 1975. These materials include 7 8mm film reels and several hundred slides from Vago's trips abroad. Slides document Vago's travels in Mongolia, which he used in lectures about the Mongolian People's Republic. Films in the collection document youth marches and festivals between 1958 and 1962. The collection also contains a railroad spike Vago acquired during his travels, although the origin of the spike is unclear.</field>
