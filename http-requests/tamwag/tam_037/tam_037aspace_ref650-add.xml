    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is comprised of materials received after the original donation was processed and microfilmed. It documents Vladeck's career in the Socialist and American Labor parties, as business manager of the Jewish Daily Forward, and as a leader of anti-fascist and anti-Nazi organizations. The earliest material in this series dates from soon after Vladeck's arrival in the United States. There are copies of papers he wrote while in college, early tax returns, and a few letters relating to Vladeck's brief tenure as a NYC Alderman during World War I. Most of the correspondence and subject files are devoted to the 1930s, the last decade of Vladeck's life. A small selection of correspondence and related materials of Vladeck's wife, Clara Richman Vladeck, and his daughter, May Vladeck Bromberg, are included in a family sub-series. There is also material documenting the Women's Division of the American Labor Party, in which May Bromberg was a major figure, as well as clippings and condolence letters about Vladeck's death in 1938.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the correspondence series are important letters to and from Daniel Hoan, Norman Thomas, Upton Sinclair, and prominent figures in the world of Jewish culture and the Jewish labor movement. This series also strongly represents Vladeck's role in the political, cultural, and charitable activities of the Forward Association and radio station WEVD. Vladeck's tenure as a member of the New York City Housing Authority is documented in Sub-series B, and his 1937 campaign for the City Council in Sub-series C. A set of clippings (mostly in English) document Vladeck's career in the Council as the majority leader of the Socialist, American Labor Party, and Republican Fusion coalition. The housing series includes files of minutes of several committees and sub-committees of the NYC Housing Authority. Included, as well, are materials about workers' housing collected from Israel, the Soviet Union, England, and Canada, as well as the United States, and a group of speeches about workers' housing in New York. A small selection of documents and clippings details the opening and construction of the Vladeck Houses, a public housing project named for Vladeck after his death.</field>
