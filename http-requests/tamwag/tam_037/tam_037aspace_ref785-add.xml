    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains over 480 photoprints and offers an in-depth view of both the personal and political life of Baruch Charney Vladeck. Among the pictures included in the initial donation, portraits of Vladeck himself and snapshots of his family make up one-fourth of the collection. Included are albumen prints of Vladeck and his brother in Russia as young men. Photoprints such as the fourth reunion of the Jewish Labor Bund in 1929 and Vladeck with a group of bundist and futurists in Europe emphasize that he maintained his ties with Jewish leftists in Europe. At the same time, the range of his political involvements in America are also documented in these photoprints. Examples include: Vladeck with Mayor La Guardia and other New York City Housing Authority members, Vladeck at an unidentified rally  with John Lewis, and David Dubinsky and Vladeck speaking at the 50th Anniversary Dinner of the Jewish Press in America. The collection also includes photoprints of his funeral in 1938 (including those showing Governor Lehman, Mayor La Guardia and Senator Wagner), the dedication of the S.S. Vladeck in 1944, and a group of thirty-two images of Governor Lehman. In 1996 an additional forty-one black and white photographs were donated to the library, ranging in type from 2" x 3" snapshots to 8" x 10" formal portraits. Dates range from the 1920s-1940s. Subjects include Vladeck himself, acquaintances, and housing in the United States, Eastern Europe, and Israel.</field>
