    <field name="abstract_teim">Al Lannon (1907-1969), born Albert Vetere, was an Italian American Communist and a leading figure in the Communist Party USA's orgainizing and labor union activism involving merchant mariners and stevedores, from 1930 through 1955. As an organizer for the Waterfront Sections of both the CPUSA, and for the New York State CP, he was one of the founders of the National Maritime Union, which represented merchant mariners on the East and Gulf coasts, and on the Great Lakes. From 1943-45 he was District Organizer of the Party's Maryland-Washington, DC district. In 1957 he moved to San Francisco, California, and remained a rank and file Communist activist, along with his wife Elva, until his death. The collection contains twelve FBI files re: Al Lannon (1907-1969), Communist maritime workers leader, two files on wife, Elva Elizabeth Lannon (also a Communist activist), one file on his son, Albert Francis Lannon, Jr., later also known as Albert Vetere Lannon. There is also an FBI report, "Communist Infiltration of the Merchant Marine (1955; 88 pp.) While the files were apparently received in 1977, in response to an FOIA request filed by Lannon, Jr., also included is one file, containing historian Harvey Klehr's "Notes from Al Lannon's FBI File," apparently from a separate FOIA request, ca. 1981.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Al Lannon (1907-1969), born Albert Vetere, was an Italian American Communist and a leading figure in the Communist Party USA's orgainizing and labor union activism involving merchant mariners and stevedores, from 1930 through 1955, when he was convicted under the Smith Act (1940), of advocating the violent overthrow of the U.S. government, and served a year in prison. As an organizer for the Waterfront Sections of both the CPUSA, and for the New York State CP, he was one of the founders of the National Maritime Union, which represented merchant mariners on the East and Gulf coasts, and on the Great Lakes. He also led an ultimately unsuccessful drive to organize stevedores in the same area. From 1943-45 he was District Organizer of the Party's Maryland-Washington, DC district. In 1957 he moved to San Francisco, California, and remained a rank and file Communist activist, along with his wife Elva, until his death.</field>
