    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The New York Public Library Guild Local 1930, formed in 1968, represents almost 2,000 clerical workers, library technical assistants, information assistants, librarians, and other titles. Members of Local 1930 are employed by the New York Public Library, by the City of New York in its branch libraries, and the libraries of mayoral departments and agencies. Capture of the website began in 2007. The website mostly was made up of letters from the executive board on staffing shortages in libraries, branch promotions, increases in library hours to 6 days a week, opening of NYPL site in Long Island City, job descriptions, budget cuts, and overdue raises. It also had an event calendar, their contract, benefits overview, press clippings, membership meetings, and information on their Women's and Lesbian and Gay Issues Committees. In 2010, the website underwent a redesign. The union focused on budget cuts, appeals to city government to increase the budget by President Valentin Colon, and calls for increased pay on work on Sundays. In 2012 the website was redesigned again and maintained the layout until 2017. This iteration of the website featured policies and procedures for library staff to avoid disciplinary action, news from DC 37 and AFSCME, benefits, contracts, the executive board, and articles about the libraries in the news. In 2018, www.local1930.org/ was not available on the live web and the website shifted to https://afscmeatwork.org/new-york-public-library-guild-local-1930/. It contained links to the DC 37 blog, resources for stewards, the collective bargaining agreement, and constitutions. In late 2020, the website redirected back to https://www.local1930.org/.</field>

    <field name="phystech_teim">Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content.
