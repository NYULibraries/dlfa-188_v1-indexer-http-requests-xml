The Archie Brown Photo Collection contains approximately 330 color photographs taken after the Spanish Civil War at veterans' events, receptions, memorials and demonstrations in Spain, Germany, the USSR, and the United States. Approximately half of the images are of the 60th Anniversary Homenaje in Barcelona. The collection contains three images of Dolores Ibarurri. Other veterans in these images include: Bill Bailey, Ernst Buschman (Thaelmann Brigade), Rudolph James Corbin, the Lemaire Brothers, Frank Lister, Mick O'Riordan, Milton Wolff and an unidentified Yugoslavian volunteer. There are also three images of Antonio Gaudi's Temple Sagrada Familia and Casa Battlo. The collection also contains 39 black and white photographs including 11 images of Brown at a luau in Hawaii, nine images of Brown with family and friends in the United States, five images of Brown in Nicaragua (attributed to David Wills), one image of Brown in a WWII uniform, two images of Ernest Hemingway in Spain, one image of the Lemaire Brothers, one image of Maurice-Arthur Lemaire, one image of Republican riflemen firing from a trench during the Civil War, two images of Spanish Street scenes, and one image of what appears to be a Soviet soldier in the USSR.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Negatives and Slide. The 56 black and white negatives contain images of Archie and Hon Brown with their family in the United States. Only four negatives, of Brown's family/friends, match prints in the collection. The color slide contains an image of a woman [Esther Brown?].</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Archie Brown was born on March 5, 1911 in Sioux City, Iowa to Nathan and Sarah Brown, Russian Jews who immigrated to the United States in the early years of the 20th century. In search of greater economic opportunity, Nathan relocated to Oakland, California, and soon after, 13-year-old Archie hopped a freight train to join his father and older brother in gainful employment. There he hawked newspapers and was initiated into labor activism while participating in a newsboys' strike in 1928. Members of the Trade Union Education League (TUEL), the labor-organizing wing of the Communist Party, helped the newsboys advance their cause, and fostered Brown's political education. He joined the Young Communist League (YCL) the following year and soon was taking part in efforts to organize agricultural workers, many of them migrant Mexicans and Dust-Bowl refugees. Brown's talents as a persuasive and indefatigable organizer came to the fore early on. A frequent orator at rallies and meetings, Brown was arrested at a YCL event in San Pedro in 1934 and charged with disturbing the peace; he received a three-month sentence. Following his release, he joined the International Longshoremen's Association, a forerunner to the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU), and became a moving force in organizing waterfront workers in the San Francisco Bay area. It was during this time that Brown met Esther ("Hon") Matlin at a YCL dance. By 1936 the couple were married. Theirs was an enduring union that produced four children and lasted over 50 years.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">With the overthrow of the popularly elected government in Spain by fascist forces in 1936, the Communist Party began recruiting volunteers to join the International Brigades' defense of the beleaguered nation. Brown's younger brother Frank ("Bimbo") was among the initial recruits from ILWU, Local 10 to enter the fray early in 1937. Archie, by now an important Party leader and well-known labor radical in the San Francisco area, was denied a passport by the local passport agency (his claims of wanting to pursue studies in France were met with incredulity). Undeterred, he traveled to New York City and in May 1938, after three months of unsuccessful efforts to obtain a passport, stowed away on a ship bound for France, to make his way to Spain. He arrived in time to serve with the Lincoln Brigade as company commissar in the Ebro Offensive and in the final bloody retreats of the war. Following the withdrawal of the International Brigades from Spain, Brown sailed from France to New York (this time as a third-class passenger) on the S.S. Ausonia in December 1938.</field>
