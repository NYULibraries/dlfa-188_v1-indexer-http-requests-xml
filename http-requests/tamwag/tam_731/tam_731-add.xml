    <field name="abstract_teim">David Smith was a union organizer in Cleveland, Ohio for the Cleveland Industrial Union Council in 1941. He began naval training as an Aviation Machinist at the Ford Navy Service School in Dearborn Michigan in 1942, but was held by Naval Intelligence after graduation due to suspected subversive activity before advancing to full naval service from 1942 to 1945. Esther Smith (nee Frank) served as Executive Secretary to the Town and Village Tenants' Committee to End Discrimination in Stuyvesant Town, and fought against the attempted eviction of anti-discrimination activists from Stuyvesant Town by the corporate landlord, Metropolitan Life Insurance Agency. This collection consists of letters from 1941 to 1945 from David to Esther documenting his organizing activities; his service in the United States Navy during World War II; David and Esther's early relationship and marriage; and the circumstances in which David was suspected of subversive activity by Naval Intelligence. The collection also includes materials concerning anti-discrmination in housing, illegal evictions, and efforts to desegregate Stuyvesant Town from 1949 to 1958, including documents from the Town and Village Tenants' Committee to End Discrimination in Stuyvesant Town.</field>
