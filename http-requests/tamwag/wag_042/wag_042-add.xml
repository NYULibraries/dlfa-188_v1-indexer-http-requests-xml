    <field name="bioghist_teim">The International Brotherhood of Painters, Local 490 (more commonly known as the Paperhangers), were established as a single exclusive local since 1864, located in New York City. The were originally known as section 70: Paperhangers Local Union of America and joined the Knights of Labor in 1886. In 1902, they joined the National Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of America as Local 585. For a short time, the local preferred to affiliate with the independent Amalgamated Society of Painters (1904-1906). Since 1906, the paperhangers have been organized as Local 490 of District Council 9 of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades.  During the 19th century, membership included a large number of German and English. In 1903, a large influx of Jewish paperhangers joined the union; total membership was between 60 and 120 men. As of 1980, membership was roughly 40 percent Jewish, with a strong presence of Italian and Puerto Rican members. As of 1984, there were about 300 members.</field>
