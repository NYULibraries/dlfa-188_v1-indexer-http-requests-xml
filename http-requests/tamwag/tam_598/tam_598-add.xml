    <field name="abstract_teim">The Occupy Wall Street Audio Collection consists of digital audio recordings collected by members of the Occupy Wall Street Think Tank and other Occupy Wall Street (OWS) groups in late 2011 and early 2012, oral histories of OWS members conducted by Rachel Goodfriend in 2011, as well as a spreadsheet documenting different metadata about video recordings of OWS actions.  The audio recordings consist of Think Tank sessions and oral histories of OWS members.  The Think Tank was an open discussion group that met daily at Zuccotti Park and other locations in New York City from noon to 6:00pm daily to discuss topics related to the OWS movement from November 2011 to early 2012.  Think Tank topics include justice, political and economic systems, reorganization of OWS small groups, police activity in Zuccotti Park, and the future of the OWS movement.  The oral histories provide detailed information about the lives of OWS members before the movement, their reasons for joining the movement, and their experiences at Zuccotti Park.</field>
