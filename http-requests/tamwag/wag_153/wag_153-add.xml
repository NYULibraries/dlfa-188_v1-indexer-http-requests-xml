    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the collection consists of shop files reflecting the bargaining efforts of Local 138. These files contain contracts and agreements between Local 138 and employers, as well as a small amount of correspondence and notes related to bargaining efforts. Contracts between the union and employers largely feature grocery stores, furniture companies, warehouses, moving companies, freight companies, and various merchants. Some contracts are dated as early as early as 1938, but the majority date from the mid-1960s to the 1980s.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The International Brother Hood of Teamsters, Local 138 (Furniture, Flour and Grocery Teamsters and Chauffeurs) was chartered in 1927 and therefore is one of the earliest Teamster locals in New York City. The charter was amended in 1940 to include the City of Brooklyn. The Local has suffered declining membership since the 1980s as a result of the loss of small businesses and downsizing. The Local conducted a prolonged and costly strike after the takeover of White Rose Foods by Arthur M. Goldberg in 1990.</field>
