    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters Oral History Collection consists of audio recordings and transcripts of interviews with Black people who worked as sleeping car porters and were members of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  The interviews date from the 1970s to the 1990s and were conducted in New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; and Los Angeles, California. The narrators discuss their family background, their emigration from the southern United States (US) to the northern US, and their experiences working for the Pullman Company. The interviews cover race relations in the labor movement, segregation within the American Federation of Labor, and civil rights in the early to mid 20th century.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Manhattan, New York in 1925 by A. Philip Randolph, Ashley L. Totten, W. H. Des Verney, and Roy Lancaster. Those attending the meeting called for recognition of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP) and the end of Pullman's Employee Representation Plan, a company union. It was not until 1936 that the BSCP received an international charter from the American Federation of Labor (AFL). A year later, the union took advantage of the apparatus of the new National Labor Relations Board and signed its first contract with the Pullman Company. This contract called for a 240-hour work month, a wage hike amounting to $1.25 million overall, job security, and union representation.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">BSCP membership declined in the 1950s and 1960s as the railroad industry declined. With the rise of Amtrak in the early 1970s, the union experienced a brief resurgence until 1974 when Amtrak made a contract with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union.  The BSCP merged with the Brotherhood of Railway and Airline Clerks in 1978. </field>
