    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Subseries I:B: New York City Council Files, 1937-1948, provides a detailed record of Mike Quill's political activity, beginning with his successful 1937 campaign, on the American Labor Party (ALP) ticket, for a seat on the New York City Council representing a district in the Bronx. Flyers, brochures, reports, correspondence, financial records and voter lists from this and his subsequent Council campaigns, and accompanied by material documenting the campaigns of other ALP and ALP-endorsed candidates (notably Congressmen Vito Marcantonio and Leo Isaacson, and Mayor William O'Dwyer). Also included are files of material illustrating Quill's appeals to various ethnic groups (in many languages), letters of support from other CIO unions, documentation of CIO political activity in New York City, and the records of support groups such as the Quill Association, the Independent Citizens Committee to Elect Quill, the TWU's Committee to Elect Quill and various neighborhood groups. Correspondence files and files of bills and resolutions introduced or supported by Quill reflect the range of his political concerns (including housing, health care, working conditions of public employees, immigrant affairs, price controls and other consumer issues and anti-discrimination measures).</field>
