    <field name="abstract_teim">Sidney Eisenberger (b. 1907), was a New York City Communist, and a chemistry instructor at City College, City University of New York (City). In 1941 he was fired for allegedly giving false testimony to the New York State Legislature Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate the Educational System of the State of New York, known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee (1940-42), created to examine the extent of "subversive activities" in the state's schools and colleges, when he denied being a member of the Communist Party. Eisenberger subsequently worked as an engineer. In his later years he wrote an unpublished autobiographical typescript, "Communism on Campus: Recollections and Comments of a Former Communist Teacher at CCNY," that describes his family, youth, education, political views, years at CCNY and his dismissal therefrom, his work at the Gussack Machine Products Company, and his later disillusionment with Communism.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York State Legislature Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate the Educational System of the State of New York, known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee (1940-42) was created to examine the extent of "subversive activities" in the state's schools and colleges. The Committee subpoenaed City College students, faculty and administrators, who were required to give testimony about their political affiliations and those of their associates. Among some fifty staff and faculty alleged to be members of the Communist Party, eleven, including Eisenberger, were dismissed on April 22, 1941, for allegedly giving false testimony to the Rapp-Coudert Committee when they denied Communist Party membership during the Committee's hearings.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Subsequently, Eisenberger went to work for Gussack Machine Products, whose general manager and part owner, Moses Cammer, employed many blacklisted professionals. In his later years, Eisenberger wrote this autobiographical typescript.</field>
