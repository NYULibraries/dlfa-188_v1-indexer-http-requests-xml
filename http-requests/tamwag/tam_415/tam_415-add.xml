    <field name="abstract_teim">The Leo Hershkowitz collection of New York Supreme Court records and research material is an assembled collection of diverse materials pertaining to early New York City social and economic history. Hershkowitz (1924-2017) was a professor at Queens College and a recognized expert on early New York City history, particularly of the Jewish community, from its origins to the period before the 20th century mass migrations. The collection includes court records, assorted family papers and corporate records, theater ephemera, illustrations, newspaper clippings and maps, dating from the early 1700s to the early 20th century. The bulk of the collection consists of common orders of the New York Supreme Court, dating from 1825 to 1915. Together these materials document the emergence of downstate New York's prominence in global trade, finance and culture. Also included in this collection are a small quantity of personal records and research materials from Leo Hershkowitz.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Leo Hershkowitz collection of New York Supreme Court records and research material is an assembled collection of diverse materials dating from the early 1700s to the mid-20th century pertaining to New York City social and economic history. The bulk of the collection consists of common orders, or procedural records, of the New York Supreme Court from 1848 to 1910. Assorted records from other New York, New Jersey and Tennessee courts are also included in this collection. Printed materials reflect public and commercial life in the city, including advertisements, incorporation records, public notices, illustrations and maps. The performing arts are reflected through playbills and sheet music. There are a substantial number of clippings from major publications such as Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Gleason's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion. This collection also includes a small amount of assembled family, organizational and corporate records, such as correspondence, account books, and captains' logs. Finally, this collection includes personal records from Leo Hershkowitz, including correspondence, research notes in both paper and electronic form, and manuscripts.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Leo Hershkowitz was a professor emeritus of history at Queen College where he taught for close to fifty years. Hershkowitz was born on November 21st, 1924 in the Bronx, New York. Before attending Hunter College through the G.I. Bill, Hershkowitz served in the Army on Hawaii. He received his master's degree from Columbia College and Ph.D. from New York University. Hershkowitz primarily researched and wrote about early New York history and early history of Jews in New York City. He began teaching history at Queens College in 1960 and also taught classes at New York University.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hershkowitz was known as a leading expert in colonial Jewish New York history. He was the co-editor of a book published in 1967 titled Wills of Early New York Jews, 1704-1799. Throughout his academic career, Hershkowitz sought out primary archival sources for his research. He was known for diving into dumpsters and digging at construction and open dig sites in his quest to find historical artifacts and records. Through these salvaging efforts Hershkowitz gained a reputation for saving papers and objects that were earmarked for disposal. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hershkowitz's salvaging methods directly influenced how he wrote about well known historical figures. In 1977, Hershkowitz published his most well known book, Tweed's New York: Another Look. In the book, he claims that William Marcy Tweed did not steal millions of dollars from the city's treasury and was never convicted of that crime in court. Hershkowitz claims that primary archival material that he salvaged—payrolls, vouchers and other financial documents—absolves Tweed of his most well known crime.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hershkowitz died on August 10th, 2017 in Boston, Massachusetts.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Donated by Dr. Leo Hershkowitz in 2008; additional materials were donated in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013. The accession numbers associated with these gifts are: 2008.050, 2008.053, 2009.025, 2009.025, 2009.090, 2010.099, 2011.054, 2011.143, and 2013.029.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">This collection has a complex custodial history. The New York Supreme Court Common Orders, which form the bulk of this collection, were transferred from the City of New York to Queens College in 1984. The City of New York retained common orders beginning with the letters C and D. Leo Hershkowitz conducted an appraisal to determine which records were of value. In part, this meant he retained records relating to famous people, such as John Jacob Astor, Thomas Edison, Hamilton Fish, William M. "Boss" Tweed, Andrew Carnegie, and others. Hershkowitz also indicated he had implemented limited random sampling and retained chronological series of at least some case files. In 1994 the records were transferred to Hofstra University, and in 2007 (following more aggressive sampling) to New York University. These court records were merged, presumably by Leo Hershkowitz, with an artificial collection of records from courts throughout New York State, assorted private and public records, and ephemera to become the Leo Hershkowitz collection. The custodial history of the remaining court records, public and private records, and ephemera is unknown.</field>
    <field name="phystech_teim">An access terminal for viewing WordPerfect documents in the collection is available by appointment for reading room viewing and listening only. Researchers may view original container and/or carrier through QuickView Plus software on laptops available in the reading room, but the physical carriers themselves are not available for use because of preservation concerns.</field>
