    <field name="bioghist_teim">David Havens is a former minister who captured documentary photographs of the Cuban Revolution in 1959. Havens attended the Lexington Theological Seminary in Lexington, Kentucky in the late 1950s. On January 1, 1959, during his winter break at the seminary he read that Cuban President Fulgencio Batista had fled Cuba. Interested in witnessing the Cuban Revolution first hand, Havens posed as a freelance journalist and traveled to Cuba with no photography experience and a 35mm camera he had borrowed from his roommate. He arrived in Havana several days later. While in Havana he accompanied a small band of armed men keeping peace in the city and documenting the reaction of people in the streets. He later witnessed the arrival of Fidel Castro and his army in Havana on January 8. Havens left Cuba on January 8, shortly after Castro's arrival, and took hundreds of photos during his short trip. When he returned to Kentucky wrote about his experience in the Lexington Herald. Although he took hundreds of photos during his travels to Cuba only 51 have survived. </field>
