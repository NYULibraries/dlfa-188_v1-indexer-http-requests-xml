    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Shelf Life is the quarterly newsletter of the Working Class Movement Library in Salford, England. The archived website contains PDFs of the newsletter dating back to 2006. The newsletter focuses on topics such as bequests to the library, grant applications, new acquisitions to the collections, collection highlights, outreach initiatives, staff updates, trade union support, obituaries, fundraising, information on the annual Frow lecture, and other events and exhibitions at the Library.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Working Class Movement Library was formed out of the personal library collection of Edmund and Ruth Frow at their home at 111 King's Road, Stretford, England in the 1950s. In the 1980s, the Salford City Council agreed to support the library and the collection was moved to Jubilee House on Salford Crescent. The collection focuses on the history of Britain's working class from the beginning of industrialization to the present day, as well as materials on left campaigns, the Spanish Civil War, and the Communist Party of Great Britain.</field>
