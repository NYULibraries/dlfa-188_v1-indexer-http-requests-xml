    <field name="abstract_teim">Cecily McMillan (she/they, born 1988) is an activist and prisoner rights advocate. She was a participant in the Occupy Wall Street momement (OWS), and was arrested and convicted of felony second-degree assault during an incident at an OWS protest in Zuccotti Park on March 17, 2012. McMillan's arrest, trial, sentencing, and subsequent 58 days of incarceration at Rikers Island were highly publicized, and criticized by supporters as a miscarriage of justice highlighting the prevalence of police brutality and the prison industrial complex. Since their release, McMillan has become an ardent prisoner rights advocate, highlighting the connections between poverty and incarceration. The Cecily McMillan Papers (dated 1961-2020, bulk 2007-2019) consist of materials created and collected by McMillan documenting her personal life, education, and activism, with particular emphasis on her participation in the Occupy Wall Street movement and highly publicized arrest, trial, and incarceration. Materials include journals, correspondence, ephemera, meeting notes, photographs, research materials, and publications from Rikers Island. Additionally, there are personal materials such as diplomas, graduation programs, photographs, and correspondence.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Cecily McMillan Papers (dated 1961-2020, bulk 2007-2019) consist of materials created and collected by McMillan documenting her personal life, education, and activism, with particular emphasis on her participation in the Occupy Wall Street movement and highly publicized arrest, trial, and incarceration. McMillan's journals, notes, and collected printed ephemera document their engagement with the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement, including meetings and planning sessions. Their arrest, trial, and incarceration at Rikers Island in 2014 is extensively documented in this collection, and includes materials from their trial and sentencing; correspondence with attorneys; correspondence with family, friends, and other individuals expressing solidarity during their incarceration; handbooks and other administrative documents created by the New York City Department of Correction; and notes and journals documenting their daily routine while incarcerated at Rikers. These materials document not only McMillan's experiences and the impact of her incarceration on her wellbeing, employment, and housing situations, but also the administrative and bureaucratic aspects of incarceration, such as how individuals can communicate with others, what they are allowed to be in possession of, and many other aspects of daily life. Materials in this collection also reflect McMillan's broad activism and prisoner rights advocacy through collected zines and printed ephemera. This collection also documents McMillan's early life, education, life after her release, and the impact of her incarceration on her physical and mental wellbeing. These materials include correspondence, photographic prints, and high school and college course materials.</field>

    <field name="appraisal_teim">One box of personal effects of the donor's family were appraised out of the collection and returned to the donor in April 2022.
