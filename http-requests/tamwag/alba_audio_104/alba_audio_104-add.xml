    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Robert Steck Audio Recordings on Spanish Civil War Prisoners of War consist of ten audio recordings of interviews conducted by Steck and others for a Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) research project to collect reminiscences of veterans who had been prisoners in Spain.  The collection consists of audio recordings interviews with people who were prisoners of war during the Spanish Civil War, and two presentations by Steck on his project to collect these interviews.  The project was conducted in the 1970s and 1980s and some of the interviews were conducted in Spanish.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In January 1937, Robert Steck, actor and social activist, sailed to Europe to volunteer for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War.  In the following months, Steck served in the International Brigades with the First Regiment de Tren, where he was elected political commissar; worked with British writer Ralph Bates, putting out the magazine Volunteer for Liberty; headed the Tarazona Base Cultural Commission, adapting his theater experience to the political and social realities of the war and creating skits performed off the back of trucks (known as "Buffoons on Trucks"); and was rifleman, runner and battalion scout for the Third Lincoln company.On April 9, 1938, during the retreat from Gandesa, Steck was captured by Italian fascists, who would have executed him were it not for Mussolini's order to exchange International Brigaders for captured fascists. Steck was first kept for two days in complete darkness at the bottom of a cistern, then transferred to the prison at San Pedro de Cardena, where he spent the following seventeen months. While in prison Steck organized an "Institute for Higher Learning" and, together with fellow-prisoners Hy Wallach and Sidney Rosenblatt, put out a handwritten newspaper, "Jaily News," illustrated by British prisoner Jimmy Moon. They made only a single copy of each issue, concealing it beneath the floorboards when it wasn't being surreptitiously circulated among the prisoners (Steck later smuggled two issues home under his clothes). It was only after the war had ended that the State Department finally negotiated the release of a group of eleven prisoners that included Steck. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After returning to the States he quickly connected with the recently-formed Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB), chairing the Committee for the Release of the International Prisoners in Spain.  After serving in World War II, Steck became a history teacher. Steck remained a core member of VALB, serving twice on the Executive Board of the National Council, and chairing the Prisoner Historical Committee. From 1979 through 1986, he worked closely with veteran Carl Geiser on Geiser's book Prisoners of the Good Fight (Lawrence Hill and Co., 1986), organizing fundraising endeavors, conducting research -- including taped interviews, and traveling internationally to locate American ex-prisoners.</field>
