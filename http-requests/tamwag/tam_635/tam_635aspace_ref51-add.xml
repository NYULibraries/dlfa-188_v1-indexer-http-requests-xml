    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brecht Forum, originally located at 451 West Street in Manhattan, now at 388 Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, is a Marxist cultural and educational center. The Brecht Forum was founded in 1975 as The New York Marxist School. In 1984, the founding collective incorporated as The Brecht Forum with The New York Marxist School as the Forum's core project. In addition to the New York Marxist School, it also offers other programs, language classes, and arts and cultural events. The website contains information on their curriculum and classes, programming from 2007-2014, as well as economic news analysis. Over the years, the Brecht Forum supported different types of programming, including the Neues Kabarett, the Right to City podcast series, the Manifestoon, the Institute for Popular Education, the Theater of the Oppressed Laboratory, the Harvey Goldberg Classroom Benefits from 2006-2009, Strategic Visions discussion series, and other events and programs. In 2014, after the Brecht Forum closed, the website remained active as a video gallery until 2017. The YouTube channel was focused on the years 2007-2014, the majority of which were uploaded to be part of the video gallery on the main website after the Brecht Forum's closing.</field>
