    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection is made up of mostly clippings and leaflets pertaining to Lawrence Maxwell's work in the socialist movement at Harvard University, the bulk of which come from 1928-1930. Maxwell led the Harvard University Socialist Club, and much of the collection consists of press clippings from many different newspapers detailling Maxwell's arrests, demonstrations, and other political activities. Maxwell hired a clipping service to collect these. Some clippings from the Harvard Crimson detail the treatment of chambermaids at Harvard, about which Maxwell wrote a leaflet. Biographical documents in this collection are of his marriage and change of name certificates, as well as military IDs and passports. Additionally, an oral history interview by Jon Bloom, has been removed to the Library's oral history collection.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lawrence Maxwell (born Lawrence B. Cohen, Jr., October 20, 1909.) briefly attended Harvard University, where he founded the Harvard University Socialist Club in 1928. He became an atheist and changed his name to not be identified as Jewish.  In the Socialist party, he went by Albert Robertson (which was his grandfather's name). During his sophmore year, he left Harvard and became a member of the Young Communist League (YCL), and later he became a Trotskyist for a short time. Maxwell worked in a small bookstore and when World War II broke out joined the Merchant Marines.  Maxwell moved to New York City and opened a bookstore, which went bankrupt in 1950.  He then went to work for the Bureau of Business Practice, a subsidiary of Prentice Hall.  Maxwell died in 1991.</field>
