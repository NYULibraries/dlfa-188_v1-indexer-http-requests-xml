    <field name="abstract_teim">The Council of School Supervisors and Administrators (formerly the Council of Supervisors and Administrators) represents principals and other categories of supervisory/administrative personnel in the New York City school system. It had its origins in a number of separate and relatively powerless associations representing supervisors, and took its present form, as a union chartered by the AFL-CIO, in the aftermath of the crises associated with decentralization and community control of schools and the teachers' strike of 1967-1968. The collection consists of 13 linear feet of photographs, negatives, and contact sheets that span 1957 to 2001 and come  mainly from the files of the union's newspaper, CSA News.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The small portion of the collection that is arranged by subject includes images of a miscellany of various events, conventions, meetings, schools, strikes, demonstrations, rallies, picket lines and a Labor Day parade, shot between 1957 and 2000, as well as portraits of individuals, including CSA leaders such as Jack Zuckerman, Donald Singer, and Peter O'Brien. The bulk of the collection, however, consists of images published, or selected for possible publication, in the union's newspaper, CSA News, for its volumes 8 through 34 (between 1974 and 2001).  These are arranged by volume number (within print and contact sheet and negative series), with little or no description of their contents. Although most of the contact sheets in the CSA News series have corresponding negatives, and the series include some prints with matching negatives, it is doubtful that these files contain all of the images published in CSA News.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Council of School Supervisors and Administrators (formerly the Council of Supervisors and Administrators) represents principals and other categories of supervisory/administrative personnel in the New York City school system. Its origins are in the post-World War II years, when supervisors in various categories (including assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, chairmen of departments, junior principals and principals of youth and adult centers) were represented by a number of separate, and relatively powerless, associations. Eleven of these associations came together in 1961 to form a Council of Supervisory Associations of the Public Schools of New York City.  The Council (aka CSA) took its present form, as a union chartered by the AFL-CIO, in the aftermath of the crises associated with decentralization and community control of schools and the teachers' strike of 1967-1968.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In recent decades the CSA has functioned as a fully-fledged trade-union, aggressively defending staffing, salary and benefits levels and tenure for supervisors; managing a Welfare Fund; lobbying on all legislative matters affecting public education (often in cooperation with the United Federation of Teachers and other public employee unions); providing educational and training opportunities for members; raising issues of workplace health and safety; and creating a more than 9,000-strong retirees' chapter.  The union has also steadily expanded its outreach efforts, both to members and to the general public, through its publications such as its newspaper, CSA News, whose longtime news editor, Charnia Adelman, was largely responsible for the preservation and arrangement of most of the photographs in the CSA Photographs Collection.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">This collection was separated from the Council of School Supervisors Records (WAG 269), which were donated by Ernest Logan (CSA President) on behalf of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, in 2007.  The accession numbers associated with this collection are 1950.231, 2007.007, and NPA.2008.040.</field>
