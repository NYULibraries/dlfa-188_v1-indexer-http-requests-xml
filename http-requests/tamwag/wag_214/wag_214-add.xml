    <field name="abstract_teim">The International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, Local 580 (Ornamental and Architectural Iron Workers) was chartered in 1938, evidently as a result of the restructuring of an older local, Local 447; its members traditionally did non-structural iron work, for example, construction of stairs, trap doors, metal walls, fire escapes, metal cabinets and furniture and ornamental details. The New York iron workers' organization claimed to be the oldest in the trade, and was at one time affiliated with the Knights of Labor; its members worked on the Statue of Liberty and many other historic projects. Originally dominated by German, Jewish and Irish craftsmen, the local's membership became more diverse by the 1980s, as a result of court orders regarding affirmative action. The collection includes correspondence, financial records, subject files, reports, membership applications and withdrawals and court documents relating to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission findings and directives, photographs, ephemera, and artifacts.</field>
