    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Affiliated and Youth Organizations, 1905-1959, consists of material from  the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS), the Intercollegiate League for Industrial Democracy, and the Student League for Industrial Democracy. The ISS was a precursor to the LID, formed in 1905. From this organization, the collection contains pamphlets, fliers, brochures for conferences, and guides to courses in studying socialism. From the Student League for Industrial Democracy, the youth wing of the LID, the collection consists of pamphlets, songbooks, fliers and brochures, as well as publications including a brief history and an organizer's manual. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The League for Industrial Democracy, also known as the LID, was founded in 1905 by such notables as Norman Thomas, Jack London and Clarence Darrow. The group, originally named the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, focused its attention primarily on educating college students about socialism and the labor movement. In 1921, the organization took on its current name. Still addressing students, the LID was home to what became the Students for a Democratic Society, then known as the Student League for Industrial Democracy. Taking a stance on communism became a divisive issue between the two groups. The organizations diverged following the Students for a Democratic Society's convention in Port Huron, Michigan in 1960. The LID continued to produce lecture and discussion guides as well as host conferences and study commissions to achieve their goal of increasing democracy in the economic, political, and cultural life. The organization also published numerous pamphlets on socialism, labor issues, totalitarianism and democracy.</field>
