    <field name="abstract_teim">Jerome "Jerry" Oberwager (1917-2017) was a political artist and activist. Oberwager participated in an arts-in-residence program in Mexico in the late 1930s, and later worked as a model maker in the United States Army during World War II. He later worked at the newly formed United Nations, making educational filmstrips for UNESCO. Oberwager had multiple entrepreneurial pursuits to support himself, including reproductions of colonial furniture and biological teaching aids. He co-founded Vagabond Puppeteers in upstate New York. The Jerry Oberwager Papers (dated 1930-2006) consists of materials created and collected by Oberwager documenting his military service, the businesses he ran to support his artistic endeavors, and his engagement with a number of leftist social movements in the mid- and late-20th century. Materials in this collection documenting Oberwager's activities as a politically engaged artist include photographs, correspondence, and ephemera from an arts-as-education program and a UNESCO project in Mexico; ephemera from Oberwager's arts-related businesses; and ephemera, photographic prints, and filmstrips documenting his work in the audiovisual department of the United Nations producing education filmstrips. Many of the filmstrips documented in this collection are teaching aids about the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Other materials document leftist social movement groups Oberwager was involved in, with particular emphasis on organizations in the Great Neck area of Long Island. The collection also includes a small amount of ephemera documenting the founding and activities of the Vagabond Puppeteers. The collection also documents Oberwager's military service, and includes official service records, research notes, and photographic prints. Some of the photographs depict graphic wartime injuries and others documenting Oberwager's model-making and puppetry depict racist caricatures.</field>

    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Donated by Kathie Amatneik in June 2023; the accession number associated with this gift is 2023.075.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">The following items were appraised out the collection at the point of acquisition: microslide sets, published texts already in Tamiment Library holdings, published texts outside of the Tamiment Library collecting areas, duplicate materials, newspaper clippings without immediate context, source photography, select examples of Oberwager's artwork, and mounted images. There is ample documentation of Oberwager's work creating and distributing microslide viewers; the viewers themselves are outside of Tamiment's collecting scope. The collection includes many examples of Oberwager's craft and artwork; a stained glass window kit, a Darwin poster, an image of a chalkware figuring, and bicentennial artwork were returned to the donor.</field>
