    <field name="abstract_teim">Jay Allen (1900-1972) was a journalist who worked for the Chicago Tribune Paris Bureau, in addition to other publications. He worked as a foreign correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, and conducted interviews with Francisco Franco and José Antonio Primo de Rivera. Barbara W. Tuchman (1912-1989) was a journalist and historian. She covered the Spanish Civil War as a contributing writer for The Nation. Her 1938 work The Lost British Policy: Britain and Spain Since 1700 is based on her experiences. This collection consists of materials created and collected by Jay Allen and Barbara Tuchman documenting their coverage of the Spanish Civil War. Materials in this collection include correspondence, pamphlets, a scrapbook of Allen's newspaper clippings, and an extensive chronology. The chronology was created by Allen and Tuchman during the War and covers events in Spain from Feb. 1936 through Nov. 1936. The single-spaced typed text densely covers oversized sheets that measure roughly 16" x 23". Each month has been separately foldered. There are also notes, drafts and fragments which have not been integrated into the larger chronology.</field>
