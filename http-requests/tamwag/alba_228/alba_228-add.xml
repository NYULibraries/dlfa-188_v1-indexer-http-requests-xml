    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection primarily consists of photocopied documents related to Carter's experiences in the U.S. Army. All the papers post-date Carter's involvement in the Spanish Civil War. Materials include clippings pertaining to Carter's World War II service; letters from Carter to his wife, Mildred Hoover Carter, written while in service with the U.S. Army; and flyers for the Negro American Labor Council and the March on Washington. Also includes a report on Army discrimination against African Americans; a letter and citation signed by President Bill Clinton and documents associated with the ceremony for an Army supply ship named after Carter; and biographical materials outlining Carter's heroic service in World War II. Photographs include Carter in uniform, photos related to the presentation of his Congress Medal of Honor; his reburial at Arlington Cemetery in 1997; the ship naming ceremony; and a photo of Allene G. Carter with Bill Clinton. Also included are minutes and photographs, probably belonged to by Jesse Vaughn, Allene Carter's father, relating to the United Packinghouse Workers of America.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Edward Allen Carter, II (1916-1963) was born in Los Angeles to missionary parents, and raised in Shanghai, China.  As a teenager he joined the Chinese Nationalist Army to fight the Japanese, winning rapid advancement.  He later joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and served in Spain, beginning in June 1937.  Carter enlisted in the U.S. Army in September 1941 and was shipped overseas in November 1944.  In 1945, while stationed in Germany, Carter distinguished himself in battle, suffering multiple bullet wounds. His heroic actions went unheralded by the U.S. Army for many years, due largely to discrimination against African Americans. Suspicion of Carter's political background led the Army to reject his effort to re-enlist in 1949. Carter died on January 30, 1963.  More than three decades after his death, the Army and the U.S. government finally recognized Carter's bravery with a Congress Medal of Honor. The U.S. also named a ship after Carter, and his body was re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery in 1997.</field>
