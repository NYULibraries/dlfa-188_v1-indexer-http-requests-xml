    <field name="scopecontent_teim">An organization that included large numbers of lively young people needed to--and did--offer its members numerous opportunities for socializing and recreation, a broad category that included parties (aka "socials"), dances, holiday celebrations (Christmas, Hanukkah, Easter, Halloween, St. Patrick's Day, Purim), fiestas, picnics, boatrides, music, song, comedy, and theatrical performances (including well-known popular entertainers of the time like Harry Belafonte and Sam Levenson performing at the union's own nightclub and supper club in the penthouse in its headquarters building), as well as sports such as baseball, softball, men's and women's basketball and bowling, boxing, and swimming. The union also documented the numerous contests it sponsored, including vacation-contest winners frolicking at Zunbarg's resort in the Catskills, in the summer and in the snow, and beauty pageant contestants posing (igniting a pre-feminist-movement controversy in the pages of the union newspaper—both in its letters section and in the internal captions for the images that characterized them as "cheesecake"). Also included are images showing the myriad cultural activities the union offered to its members--both as consumers (through special performances for the union by a range of artists, such as the Katherine Dunham Dancers) and as creators--through the union's own chorus, band, orchestra, and drama groups that presented pageants, sketches, skits, and full plays--including dramas ("Death of a Salesman") and musicals and comic parodies written especially for the union (for example, "Thursdays 'Til Nine" a musical about working in a department store, and "Plant in the Sun"—probably a parody of Lorraine Hansberry's "Raisin in the Sun"). Also documented are union clubs featuring hobbies such as stamp collecting, chess, and bridge, classes in modern and ballroom dancing, and the numerous cultural and recreational activities and outings that the union offered its retired members (the latter perhaps extensively publicized simply because it demonstrated that its members were able retire in some comfort and security, because of benefits conferred by union membership). Cultural exchange also had a highly visible role in the union, with visits to the union by leaders of labor unions and labor parties from around the world, including Europe, Asia, Latin America, and African countries emerging or newly-emerged from colonialism (Kenya's Tom M'boya was one) duly recorded, as well as visits by domestic groups such as college and high school students. Also photographed were educational and vocational training opportunities offered by the union to its members, including classes in foreign languages, labor history, and the arts, as well as courses to prepare members for white collar occupations, such as typing and stenography, and as well as for more industrial work, featuring training in using industrial machinery.</field>
