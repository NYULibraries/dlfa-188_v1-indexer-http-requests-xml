    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Throughout its existence, District 65 and its members were vigorously engaged in a broad range of political and social change activities, issues, and election campaigns, at the local, national, and international level, that were outside of the union's own immediate bread and butter concerns. While these included other unions' struggles, they also included its involvement in the civil rights movement (the union was an early supporter of the work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) and the "ban the [nuclear] bomb" and anti-Vietnam war movements. Also included are images demonstrating the union's early support and lobbying for Medicare and Social Security, rent control, public transportation, Russian and Spanish war relief, the United Nations, establishing the State of Israel, supporting India's independence from Britain, unemployment insurance, and local, state, and national progressive mainstream political candidates as well candidates for third parties such as the American Labor Party and Progressive Party, such as Progressive Party presidential candidate Henry Wallace. Moreover, when viewed chronologically, the images will frequently reflect the trajectory of the changing political landscape, and the union's efforts to accommodate itself to that landscape, as for example initial opposition to United States involvement in World War II (union members carrying signs declaring, "The Yanks Are Not Coming") and then post-Pearl Harbor huge union-sponsored war bond rallies.</field>
