    <field name="abstract_teim">A number of national organizations were created in response to the Rosenberg and Sobell espionage cases in which Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and sentenced to death and Morton Sobell was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Following the conviction of the Rosenbergs in 1951, the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case (NCSJRC) was formed. In the early 1970s Michael and Robert Meeropol, the Rosenberg's sons, sued the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act, and won the release of hundreds of thousands of previously secret documents pertaining to their parents' case.  The National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case (NCRRC) was formed in conjunction with the proceedings of the suit. The NCRRC sought to exonerate the Rosenbergs, prove their innocence, and push for acknowledgement from the United States government that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the trial proceedings.

The collection contains materials spanning the years 1944-2005, with the bulk of material dating from 1974-1997. The majority of materials in the collection were created in the process of the outreach and publicity work that the organization did, and include correspondence and promotional materials. Promotional materials consist of research files (e.g. court transcripts, FOIA documents, newspaper clippings, and promotional materials from other organizations), article and newsletter drafts, newsletters, newsletter mock-ups, press releases, flyers, event programs and planning materials, pamphlets, booklets, photographic prints and negatives, and ads. Related to these promotional materials and research files are works and publications created in response to, or inspired by, the Rosenberg case. These include plays, an opera, music, manuscripts, theses, and books from writers, researchers, and students. These artistic and academic creations include manuscripts, bound materials, cassette tapes, audio CDs, vinyl records, and a VHS tape. To a lesser extent, there are administrative records such as meeting minutes, agendas, memos, event planning documents, fundraising reports, local committee finances, and financial reports.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains materials spanning the years 1944-2005, with the bulk of material dating from 1974-1997. The vast majority of materials in the collection were created in the process of outreach and publicity work, and include correspondence and promotional materials. To a lesser extent, there are administrative records such as meeting minutes, agendas, and memos; event planning documents; fundraising reports; local committee materials (including finance reports, correspondence, and promotional material); donor cards; and financial reports. A large chunk of the administrative materials pertain to the Carnegie Hall events coordinated by the Committee, primarily the 1974 event which kickstarted the efforts of the Committee. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of the promotional materials, there are materials related to distributable printed matter such as newsletters, press releases, news bulletins, pamphlets and booklets, posters, buttons, event flyers and programs, advertisements, invitations, book reviews, speeches, a sermon, correspondence, and their respective drafts, mock-ups, and notes. There are also research files or collected materials used for the process of creating promotional materials. These include materials such as court transcripts, FOIA documents, newspaper clippings, correspondence, newsletters and promotional materials from other organizations, transcripts of public appearances, interview transcripts, photographic prints, photographic negatives, and copies of website text. Related to these promotional materials and research files are works and publications created in response to, or inspired by, the Rosenberg case. These include plays, an opera, music, manuscripts, theses, poems, and books from writers, researchers, and students.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">A number of national and local organizations were created in response to the Rosenberg and Sobell espionage cases in which Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and sentenced to death, and Morton Sobell was sentenced to 30 years in prison. These national and local organizations engaged in community and political activism to defend, save, secure justice for, and secure clemency for the Rosenbergs. Following the conviction of the Rosenbergs and Sobell in 1951, the journalist William A. Reuben wrote a series of investigative articles for the National Guardian, and was involved in the formation of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case (NCSJRC) with David and Emily Alman. Their grassroots campaign focused on preventing the couple's execution. They organized mass protests, letter campaigns, clemency petitions, fundraisers for legal fees and child care for the Rosenberg's two young sons, and the creation and distribution of publications to present new evidence to raise questions about the legitimacy of the Rosenberg trial and death sentence.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The controversy surrounding the Rosenbergs' sentencing continued after their executions, and the grassroots campaigns of the 1950s underwent several transformations. Some groups shifted their focus to Morton Sobell, the other defendant in the case. In 1973, the Rosenbergs' two sons, Michael and Robert Meeropol, continued the work of the NCSJRC, forming the National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case (NCRRC). A major initial focus of the organization was the release, under the Freedom of Information Act, of the FBI files on the Rosenbergs. The Meeropols sued the FBI and in 1975 won the release of hundreds of thousands of previously secret documents pertaining to their parents' case.  The NCRRC sought to exonerate Julius and Ethel from the charge of atomic espionage and prove their innocence, and push for recognition from the United States government that the judicial system had not given the Rosenbergs due process. From the mid-1970s to the early 2000s, the NCRRC continued to seek an official review of the Rosenberg case and the exoneration of the couple through outreach and publicity campaigns and events.</field>
