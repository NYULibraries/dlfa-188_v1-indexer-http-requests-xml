    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection contains correspondence, including some letters from Debs to James Oneal, Algernon Lee and Edwin Markham. Letters from Theodore Debs' regarding his brother are also present in the collection. Published copies of Debs' speeches and writings are also included, as are newspaper clippings and subject files. The papers of Samuel Castleton, Debs' attorney during his trial under the 1917 Espionage Act, contain correspondence and copies of Castleton's column in the Appeal to Reason entitled "Debs in Prison." </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of particular significance are materials relating to Frank X. Holl, a colleague of Debs' from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen; the large body of correspondence between Theodore Debs and Socialist Party activist Joseph Cohen; clippings relating to the production of a Debs Medallion in 1914; subject files on Debs' "Red Special" campaign train; publicity materials from the Eugene V. Debs Foundation; and a set of playing cards with depictions of Debs and other labor leaders produced by the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Born in Terre Haute, Indiana, to French immigrant parents, Eugene V. Debs worked as a painter on the railroad and as a clerk, while becoming active in Democratic politics at the local and state levels. He gained prominence as editor of the magazine of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and served as secretary-treasurer of the union. In 1893 he broke away from the conservative Brotherhood to organize the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the first industrial unions in the United States. After leading the ARU in a bitter strike against the Pullman Company in 1894, he was sentenced to six months in jail. He was among the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905, but broke with the organization in 1908. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Debs ran for president of the United States in 1900 as the standard-bearer of the newly formed Social Democratic Party, a precursor of the Socialist Party of America. A compelling orator and charismatic leader, he was the Socialist Party's presidential candidate in 1904, 1908, 1912 and 1920. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">On June 16, 1918, Debs delivered an impassioned speech in Canton, Ohio in opposition to the United States' involvement in World War I. He was arrested and tried under the Espionage Act of 1917; the indictment accused him of "attempting to cause insubordination, mutiny, disloyalty and refusal of duty within the militaryâ€¦. [and promoting] the cause of the Imperial German Government." He was sentenced, at the age of sixty-three, to serve ten years in federal prison. In 1920, while still imprisoned at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, Debs conducted his last campaign for president; he won more than 900,000 votes - 3.5 percent of the total. On December 25, 1921, President Warren G. Harding commuted Debs' sentence to time served and Debs was released from prison.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After his release, and despite his worsening health, Debs continued to speak and publish widely on behalf of the Socialist Party, and related causes such as the campaign to free Sacco and Vanzetti. He died at the age of 70 at Lindlahr Sanitarium in Elmhurst, IL on October 20, 1926, and was buried in Terre Haute.</field>
