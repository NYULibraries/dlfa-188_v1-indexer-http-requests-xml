    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Local 1-S is a local branch of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union/UFCW (RWDSU), which represents employees at the Macy's department store in Herald Square, Manhattan and the workers in the Queens and Parkchester stores. The union works to protect Macy's employees' right to the fair wages and benefits that allow them to support themselves and their families.  Crawling of the website began in 2009 and contained information on officers and stewards, scholarships and other benefits, health and safety in retail, rights on the job, grievance procedures, vacation policy, contracts, political action and voter registration, newsletters dating back to 2002, photo galleries, and other news. In 2011, the website focused on contract negotiations with Macy's and Macy's furniture store unionization efforts in Elmhurt, Queens. There was a gap of crawling between 2015-2018. Crawling at a new URL began in 2018. The new website contained mostly news related to the 2016 contract negotiations. In 2020, the website updated with information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically the Macy's temporary store closure in March 2020, furloughs, COVID-19 safety, and reopening in June 2020. It redirected to new URLs in 2021 and 2023. The current website contains information on the 2023 contract negotiations, biographies of the union leadership, and information on worker rights.</field>
