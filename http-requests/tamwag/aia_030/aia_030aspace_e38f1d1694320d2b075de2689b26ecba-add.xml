    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Íde B. O'Carroll at Brian O'Dwyer's office at O'Dwyer &amp; Bernstein in New York, New York on May 5, 2016.  The interview covers O'Dwyer's family and working life. O'Dwyer discusses his parents, their extended families, and his siblings. He discusses his experiences in New York Irish American circles and the difficulties he faced making a name for himself after the work of his father and his cousin Frank Durkin in promoting Irish republican issues in the United States.  He recounts his decision to focus on the issues of Irish immigrants, and eventually all immigrants, in New York. He discusses his early involvement in the Irish Immigration Reform Movement in the 1980s, the role of O'Dwyer &amp; Bernstein as the first stop for newly arrived Irish immigrants, and how his involvement in both of these organizations led to the founding of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center (EIIC) in 1986.  He describes the support provided to immigrants through the EIIC. O'Dwyer discusses current immigration issues in the United States at the time of the interview, including division between Democrats and Republicans on the topic and the need for a new immigration policy in the US. He also discusses the Northern Ireland peace process in the 1990s and his views on the Catholic Church.</field>
