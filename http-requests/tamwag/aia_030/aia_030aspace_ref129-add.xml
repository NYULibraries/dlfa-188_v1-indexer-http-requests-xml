    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mr. Shanley discusses a range of topics, focusing particularly on his success in the writing world, both in theater and film, as well as his Irish background and identity. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mr. Shanley begins by discussing his childhood in the Bronx, and the difficulties he had in school because of his "differences." He describes feeling misunderstood because of his creativity, particularly by his father, who, as a survivor of the Great Depression, wanted Shanley to pursue a career with security and a pension. Shanley's difficulties in school manifested themselves as behavioral issues which resulted in hours of detention over the course of his academic career. He was asked to leave several schools before a teacher at his New Hampshire boarding school took him under his wing and ensured that he graduated. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Shanley describes his career at New York University and the way in which a five year leave from academia after high school helped his education.  He explains how his two year stint in the Marine Corps in the middle of the Vietnam War provided him with the insight to negotiate institutional structures for his personal benefit, rather than battle against them. Shanley credits the discipline of the Marines for his success at NYU, from which he graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1977. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Much of Shanley's best known work focuses on individuals struggling within institutional structures, particularly Doubt, which Shanley based on his experiences in religious-based institutions. He identifies the inspiration for Doubt as emerging from his own philosophy on life -- which advocates sticking to his convictions, regardless of his certainty in their correctness -- and draws on some of his school experiences, particularly his primary school, St. Anthony's, which was run by the Sisters of Charity. His first grade teacher was the model for the character of Sister James in the play. Shanley later hired her as a consultant on the movie version of the play, which premiered in 2008. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Doubt has garnered multiple awards for Shanley, including a 2005 Tony for best play and the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Shanley was also the recipient of an Oscar for best original screenplay for the movie Moonstruck, a 1987 film that focused on the convoluted love life of an Italian American played by Cher. During the interview he focuses largely on the evolution of his career. He discusses life experience as it relates to his success, as well as persistence -- at one point, he was living below the poverty line and working a series of odd jobs, but still producing about one play a year. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Shanley talks about his two adopted sons from his first marriage who come from very diverse ethnic backgrounds. Shanley does not consider ethnicity an integral part of their upbringing, and refers to his own Irishness as being a literal part of him, rather than something that derives from his own social or cultural upbringing. He does, however, credit his Irish background for his ability to tell a story, saying that a visit to his family's farm in Ireland made him realize how like his Irish relatives he wasâ€”finally finding a niche after years of feeling "different" and "weird." </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">John Patrick Shanley was interviewed on 5 November 2008 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Mary Catherine Williamson and Linda Dowling Almeida.  This oral history with John Patrick Shanley was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. Interview is 1 hr, 22 minutes long, on 2 CDs and has been logged at 10 minute intervals. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">John Patrick Shanley (b. 1950), writer and director best known for the screenplay for Moonstruck (1988), winner of a Best Screenplay Oscar, and Doubt: A Parable (2004), which won the Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award for Best Play. He directed his own adaptation of the play on film, which garnered five Oscar nominations, including one for Best Adapted Screenplay.</field>
