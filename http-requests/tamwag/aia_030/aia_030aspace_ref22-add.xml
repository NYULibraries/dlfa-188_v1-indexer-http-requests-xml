    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Ryan discusses the neighborhood in which he grew up. He describes 1920's Pelham Bay in the Bronx as farmland with fruit trees and gardens.  He remembers his childhood as well as his family, specifically his mother and father, immigrants from Ireland who met in New York City.  He discusses his Catholic upbringing and describes his parents' reaction to his desire to be a priest; his mother's delight and his father's support.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">After attending P.S. 71 for three years, Ryan attended the parish elementary school of Our Lady of Assumption after it opened in 1928, graduating in 1933.  He continued his education at Cathedral College for high school and his first two years of college and then St. Joseph's Seminary for the remainder of his college education and seminary training. He reveals his father's belief that he should always pay his own way and because of his conviction, he would not allow Ryan to attend Seminary school on credit as the rest of the seminarians did.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">On January 27, 1945 Gerald Ryan was ordained by Cardinal Francis Spellman (1889â€“1967). Twelve years after entering the seminary in a class of ninety-nine, sixteen were ordained.  He discusses the changes in the Catholic Church and the seminary since his pre-Vatican II educational training, including the drop in numbers of young men with vocations.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While waiting for a position as an English teacher at Cardinal Hayes High School, Ryan was assigned to St. Anthony of Padua parish in the Bronx immediately after ordination. He discusses his adjustments to parish life in an African-American community and how he came interested in the civil rights movement.  Ryan marched in Washington, DC and heard the famous "I Have a Dream" speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King in 1963, and two years later joined King and other religious leaders in Selma, Alabama to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in support of African-American voting rights.   He describes the bus ride to Selma and the unknown fear of what could happen during the march. He tells the story of the angry southerners yelling at those participating in the protest and how the atmosphere changed once the crowd recognized singer Harry Belafonte in the line of marchers. Back in New York, Ryan continued to participate in demonstrations on issues affecting all poor communities such as housing and health.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Ryan served at St. Anthony's until he was assigned as pastor of St. Luke's parish in 1966.  Several years later he learned that the call for a teaching position never came in 1945 because the pastor of St. Anthony's had personally requested of the Cardinal that Ryan remain in the parish to work with him.  Looking back, Ryan feels that remaining at St. Anthony's instead of leaving to teach was for the best.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As pastor of St. Luke's parish, Ryan ministers to a primarily Hispanic community.  He discusses the differences in participation between his current parish and the primarily Irish parish he belonged to as a child.  He tells of the current parishioners' interest in participating in the liturgy and running of the parish. He speaks of the irony that as a young priest he served with three other priests in a parish and now as an older man he is the only priest in a bi-lingual parish.  Ryan is currently the longest serving pastor in the diocese of New York.  He spends his day running the parish with his other staff and administering to his parishioners' needs.  In addition to saying the majority of the masses at St. Luke's, he works with the parish council and leads a weekly session for the troubled teens of the parish. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Ryan concludes the interview by discussing his opinions on the reasons for the lack of vocations to the priesthood and the loss of American Catholic faith.  He speaks of his love for Ireland and in particular his special devotion to the Shrine of Our Lady of Knock in County Mayo.</field>
