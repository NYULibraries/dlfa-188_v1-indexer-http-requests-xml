    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Pat Mahon discusses a range of topics from his Irish Catholic childhood in the Bronx to international Irish traditional music competitions and performance to life on Wall Street as an Irish Catholic New Yorker.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">He begins the interview discussing his family life and youth in the changing and diverse neighborhoods of the Bronx in the 1960s.  As the oldest son of Irish immigrants, he and his three siblings were educated in Catholic grammar schools and he and his sister both tested into prestigious public high schools.  He reflects on the importance of Irish identity for his parents and how they encouraged their children to build their own ethnic identity through music. Pat learned the button accordion and trained and competed with some well-known figures in the field of traditional music including Joannie Madden, Eileen Ivers, and Brian Conway. He describes his experience as the first American to win the All-Ireland championship in 1973 at the Fleadh in Listowel, Co. Kerry.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">It is clear from his discussion that music fills a central place in his life.  He reflects on his short stint as a professional musician that interrupted his undergraduate education at Fordham University and how the reality of making a living sent him back to City University of New York-Lehman College for a degree in accounting.  Despite a 20+ year career on Wall Street he has never abandoned his music and Mahon recalls how he pursued his passion for traditional music while stationed around the world for work, including years in Japan and England.  His discussion of the traditional music world and its active participants is among the most fascinating highlights of the interview, in particular, his memories of performing with Eileen Ivers in Japan are wonderful.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mahon also discusses the various career paths of his siblings, particularly his two brothers, who pursued seemingly "typical" Irish vocations in law enforcement.  He observes that the attacks on the World Trade Center altered the parameters of their work and made their occupations anything but typical. He speaks candidly about life on Wall Street and the ethnic culture of certain corporations and jobs in the financial services sector, but admitted that he did not suffer one way or the other by being Irish.  As an ex-pat for most of his adult life and career, his identity as a "Yank" created more of an identity issue for him.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">He and his wife have three children who are themselves musicians but who identify themselves as European rather than Irish, American or Irish American.  He reflects on how he and his wife met and the Irish background of his wife and her experience as an Irish dancer.  He muses on the Riverdance craze and the boost it gave the Irish dance industry around the world, including the dance studio that his sister-in-law operates in Florida.  In one anecdote he recalls how out of context it was to see young Japanese girls in "Sheila"  wigs at competitions in Japan.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This oral history with Pat Mahon was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour, 18 minutes, and 18 seconds long, on two CDs and has been logged at ten-minute intervals.  The interview took place on November 14, 2007.</field>
