    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Smyth opens the interview talking about her childhood, starting with her mother's pregnancy with her and her twin sister. She discusses the experiences of growing up with ten siblings who all lived under one roof in an old farmhouse.  She describes her mom cooking on a hearth fireplace and the sleeping arrangements in her house. She remembers her mother as a fantastic cook, making delicious dishes with simple resources and how her mother would make Treasa gather the wood in the morning to start the fire in the hearth.  She recalls selling the vegetables they raised on the farm and milking cows and talks about wearing rubber boots, or wellies, when farming. She admits surprise when she sees people wearing them today as fashionable footwear. She remembers how her dog Scotty would help her with the daily chores and talks about watching TV shows like Eurovision, Flipper, and Skippy the Kangaroo. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She remembers her dad's passing and seeing a banshee that night, and knowing it was a sign that her dad had died.  After her father's death all her siblings had to help maintain the farm. She recalls with sadness that some of her dad's customers did not pay their bills after his death and how that disturbed her because of his fairness to them while he was alive. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She talks about the importance of religion in her family. Her parents did not tolerate distractions or disruptions during their daily prayers and every Saturday her family went to confession. She recalls her first confession and how she could not think up a sin, so a nun told her to make one up. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She talks about going to school at Saint Mary's National School in Cobh and describes how the nuns were very mean to her and how in one incident a nun did not let her use the bathroom. She felt the nuns were biased against her and her siblings because they were poor and from the country and made them clean up after the rich city girls. She also recalls a funny story about having to choose between getting in trouble with her sister or a nun. She talks about being forced to learn Irish in school without much success, but that at 17 she decided to really take an interest in the language and got a scholarship to study it at summer school.  She recalls her choice to continue her studies at the vocational school rather than continue with the nuns. At vocational school she started to fall in love with learning as she acquired very practical skills like accounting and wood work. She also talks about one teacher whom she admired who played camogie. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She recalls growing up playing sports and listening to games on the radio. She talks about her mom's disapproval of girls playing sports and that she had to sneak out of the house to try out for the camogie team, only to break her ankle at the tryout. On her second attempt she made the national team but managed to hide it from her mother. She remembers that her mother finally accepted her athletic pursuits later on in her life. She also talks about the importance of the sport to her even in America and how she would help other players of the game immigrate to the US.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She describes going to Gurteen Agriculture College to study farm management and how she was one of the only women at the school. She remembers not being treated well by her male peers. During her apprenticeship she performed a job that required three men to complete when she left. Smyth chats about working in pig management and her job on a pig farm supervising 10 men. She remembers how she had to work carefully with all the men to make them feel comfortable as members of a team and ultimately winning their respect and allegiance. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> She talks about her first experience giving birth in Ireland, how she was kept in the dark about what was going to happen and where the baby would come from. She talks about the privacy in her household and the reluctance to share intimate information. She compares it to Ireland today and how more open the culture is and that people talk a little too much about their lives now.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Treasa describes coming to America for the first time and observing the degree of its diversity with some surprise. She discusses her early jobs as a domestic and how it was hard for her to make ends meet as a single mother. She talks about becoming a nurse and how at first she resisted the idea because she thought nurses were arrogant, but finally decided to go to night school. It took her four years to complete her degree. She talks about finding her social network by playing camogie at Gaelic Park and the importance of immigrants helping each other when they arrive through sports and other outlets.  She also talks about being an undocumented alien.  
Treasa talks about her mom dying and how her mother waited to pass until Treasa was back in Ireland. She recalls having a vision of her father, who was dead, holding her mother's hand as her mom died. She talks about the funeral and explains how Tommy Smyth, her husband, supported her during that time. She talks about how she met Smyth, an ESPN soccer analyst, and their 12 year courtship. Treasa talks about her faith and how Mass for her is the beginning of a new week. She talks about raising her kids in the Catholic Church. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She says her children identify themselves as Americans even though every summer Treasa sent them to Ireland to stay with family and experience life on the farm with their Irish relatives. She ends the interview describing how she is an Irish person in her heart but she loves America. </field>
