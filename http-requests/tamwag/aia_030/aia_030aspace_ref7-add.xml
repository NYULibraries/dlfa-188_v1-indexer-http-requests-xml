    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Joan Dolan's first memories come from her time as a child growing up in Ireland.  Her mother had moved her there from New York when she was only two and a half years old to live with her grandparents and her uncle.  She had grown up on a small farm in Killarue, and she attended National School in Cavan until the age of eleven.  Her parents and had come back to Ireland in order to bring her back to the United States.  She has thought about her return to America at age eleven after spending nine years in Ireland.  Joan only knew life on the small farm on which she lived.  She felt that moving to New York was both exciting; however she has second guessed her parents' decision to bring her back to the United States.   She does not have regrets about returned when she did, as affirms that she has a wonderful life here.  She does; however, remember that her uncle wished that she could have stayed until she were grown up, as she brought happiness to the lives of two older people and a bachelor. She thinks perhaps she should have left as a seventeen or eighteen year old.  Joan admits that is was difficult reunite with her parents since she really did not know them.  She began to know her parents only after she was brought back from Ireland when she was eleven years old in April of 1948.  She describes her father as a quiet man who was dedicated to his family and his work.  Her mother was a talented cook who had received on the job training in her first years as an immigrant in Providence, Rhode Island.   </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Although she is happy with the way events of her life have turned out, Joan wonders what her life would have been like if she had stayed in Ireland.  She does feel; however, that she would have had to have left Ireland in order to immigrate to the United States anyway.  It just would have been a matter of time as there would have been little room for her on the farm, and there were few jobs to be found in Ireland.  Since she did return at a young age; however, she had to adjust to American life.  She recalls the drastic change, "From Killarue to Times Square, my goodness."  She attended St. Jean Baptiste High School on the Upper East Side where she admits that it was difficult to fit in at first.  The immigrant mentality focused on assimilation.  Joan remembers that she did not want to project an image of Irishness in school; rather, she wished to be seen as an American.  These feelings changed as she grew past her adolescence, and she wished to explore and promote her Irish culture.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">When Joan was twelve years old, her parents enrolled her in Irish dancing classes in 1949 under the direction James McKenna.  She describes him as a strict, yet effective instructor.  She had lost interest in dancing after a year of lessons, and she decided to quit.  When she was nineteen, Joan resumed Irish dancing under the direction of Peter and Cyril McNiff.  She became one of their ceili dancers, and she danced competitively for four years.  She describes her time she spent dancing as one of the greatest parts of her life—she danced because she enjoyed dancing, and so she could be around the friends she made in her ceili, including Andy McCann, Eva McManus, Peter McNiff, Cyril McNiff, Hannah O'Leary, Larry Reddigan, Peter Smith, Gerry Wallace, Lori Walsh, Mike Bergin Peggy Bergin, Edmund Brown, Joan Cass, Eugene Clancy, Pat Clancy, and Jimmy Erwin.  She described the ceili uniforms of her team as being quite simple—green skirts, white stockings, white shirt, and a black dance jacket.  She compares those more traditional outfits to many of the new styles used in Irish dancing today.  She very much approves of popular productions such as Riverdance because have brought Irish dancing into the mainstream; however, the outfits—wigs, outrageous colors, and fancy embroidery—really do not embody the spirit of the dance; rather they commercialize the Irish dancing.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">After Joan married Felix Dolan, she lived in the Woodlawn and Highbridge sections of the Bronx.  Both areas were decidedly Irish; however once she had kids, the Dolan family moved to Golden's Bridge in Westchester County, NY.  She believes that she has gravitated towards people with common interests.  Even though this section of Westchester was ethnically diverse, Joan managed to find many Irish friends, including her best friend Ann McEnearny.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Joan sincerely believes that it is important that her Irish culture lives on through the generations.  Joan gave her children traditional Irish names, and she afforded all of them Irish dancing lessons.  Her children have now named their own children traditional Irish names, and some of them have begun Irish dance lessons.  In addition to dance, Joan also believed that attending Irish events as a family promoted the preservation of Irish culture.  Joan has practiced what she believes as the Dolan family has marched annually with the Gaelic League in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Today Joan continues to attend ceilis as she still retains her passion for dancing. </field>
