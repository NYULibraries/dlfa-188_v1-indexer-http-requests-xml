    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Mr. Dunn discusses a range of topics, beginning with his childhood growing up in Sunnyside, Queens.  After failing out of St. Teresa's Catholic School, Woodside, Queens, in the 7th grade, Dunn went on to finish the year at St. Anthony's Catholic School in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.  At the age of 16 Dunn dropped out of Queens Vocational High School and began a series of part-time jobs that lasted for a year.  When he was 17 Dunn enlisted in the Navy.  He was stationed in Guantanamo, Cuba for four years, and was discharged at the age of 21.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Dunn discusses his time in the Navy where he completed the G.E.D. (General Equivalency Diploma).  While in the service, he also prepared for the city civil service test.  He took the exam for the fire service.  After passing the test and returning to New York, Dunn began his career as a fireman.  He quickly climbed up the ranks of the fire service, moving from rookie fireman to deputy chief, lieutenant, and captain.  
  
Dunn then returned to school with the help of the G.I. Bill, and applied to Queens College in New York.  Eventually, he received his Bachelors and Master's Degrees.  In 1959, at the age of 24, Dunn married his wife Patricia.  He tells of the purchase of their first house in Douglaston, New York and the decoration of its backyard with stone faces and gargoyle statues acquired from torn down buildings in Harlem.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Dunn retired in 1999 after serving 42 years as a fireman.  Two years later the attacks on the World Trade Center occurred.  Dunn remarks upon the construction of these buildings and their collapse.  He shares that much of his life post-retirement is spent writing articles and giving lectures on the topic of building construction and fire-safety.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Vincent Dunn was interviewed on 13 November 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Karen Shua-Haim and Linda Dowling Almeida.
