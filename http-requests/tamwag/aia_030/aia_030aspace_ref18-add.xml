    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Ms. O'Callaghan discusses a variety of topics beginning with her family and childhood in Cork, Ireland and what life was like growing up on a farm.  After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in English, French and Sociology at the University of County Cork, she moved to Dublin to pursue a Higher Diploma in Education at Trinity College. In Dublin she was given the chance to teach inner-city kids, a far cry from the one room school house she attended as a child. She describes returning to Cork to work for Cork Local Radio as a news presenter. Wanderlust led her to answer an ad in the newspaper for a job marketing Irish hand-crafts in San Francisco, California. Ms. O'Callaghan was handed an H-3 Visa to live in what describes as a fantasy life in the United States, an experience that was somewhat different from the lives of the people she helped later in life. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She talks about how she turned a temporary stay into a permanent move after she left California for New York to work as a flight attendant for Transamerica Airlines. Reintegrating the Irish back into her life, she became involved with Adrian Flannelly's Irish radio talk show. She describes how the growing number of undocumented Irish in the mid-1980s led Adrian Flannelly to discuss solutions with the Archdiocese of New York. The talks led to the formation of Project Irish Outreach within the Catholic Charities division of the archdiocese, under the supervision of Monsignor James Murray. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Asked to help with the project's establishment, Ms. O'Callaghan found a real purpose in helping the undocumented. She wrote a small booklet titled Immigrating USA: A Guide for Irish Immigrants to answer immigrants frequently-asked questions. Project Irish Outreach had a great impact on Ms. O'Callaghan and the Irish community and she discusses at length the work that the project was able to do through community outreach, immigration and social services, and partaking in efforts to inform people of their rights. The program became a social worker network in a number of fields. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She recalls the mobilization of the Irish American community along with various other social service and legal organizations during the 1980s, also noting the always positive attitude that Americans, especially New Yorkers, have had towards the Irish. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While discussing the way her position and role within Catholic Charities has diversified and evolved, Ms. O'Callaghan explains the transformation of Project Irish Outreach since its establishment in 1987. She expresses the many ways in which immigration and the immigrants themselves have changed over time, including the complexity of the immigration system and the choices available to immigrants and emigrants.  She delves into the hurdles that the undocumented and documented have to face and the ways the immigration system and legislation can evolve to fit the needs of the immigrant population.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She closes with describing the strength of the Irish community and the people that have affected her life through her work and what her Catholic and Irish identities mean to her. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Patricia O'Callaghan was interviewed on 2 November 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Katie Hiebert, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joe Ready. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour, 41 minutes long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</field>
