    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Íde B. O'Carroll at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library at New York University in New York, New York on November 10, 2016.  The interview covers Dan Dennehy's family, his family's experience in the Woodlawn neighborhood in the Bronx, and his participation in Irish American organizations.  Dennehy discusses his family, detailing the immigration, education, and work experiences of his parents and and the relationships among Irish and Irish American families in the Woodlawn neighborhood of the Bronx between the 1960s and the 1970s.  Dennehy discusses his family's involvement with the Ancient Order of Hibernians and his role as the Immigration Officer between 2002 and the time of the interview. He recounts the experience of his wife Siobhán and other undocumented Irish immigrants in the 1980s and the fact that this led Dennehy to become involved in Irish immigration issues, particularly through the AOH, the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, and Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.  He also discusses his relationship to the County Cork Benevolent, Patriotic and Protective Association; his establishment of the Hudson Valley Irish Festival; and his association with the St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York City.</field>
