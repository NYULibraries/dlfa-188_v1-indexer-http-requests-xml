    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Regina Murphy discusses many aspects of her life, beginning with her parents' immigration to America and her childhood in Riverdale, New York.  She details the occupations her parents held as new arrivals in America – her mother a live-in maid and her father a clerk in a grocery store.  When her parents wed her father quickly bought out a grocery store, and her mother stopped domestic work and assisted in the store.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Regina Murphy reviews her childhood – she received religious education throughout her life, attending St. Margaret's School in Riverdale for primary education, New York, Sacred Heart of Mary High School, and two years at Marymount College in Tarrytown before she entered the convent.  She stresses that her religious education during those formative years greatly influence her decision to enter the convent.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Regina Murphy discusses her decision to enter the convent, against the wishes of her parents.  Four years earlier, her older brother Tommy joined the brothers.  He would leave before taking final vows, but at the time she entered the convent in 1959, he was still with the brothers.  She declares that the only time she remembers her father using profanity was when she told him she wanted to enter the convent.  In a similarly vehement reaction, her mother tore up her acceptance letter to the Sisters of Charity, and it was only upon further inquiry with the order that Sister Regina Murphy learned she had been accepted.  Although her parents did not initially accept her vocation, Sister Regina Murphy says she felt truly called to enter the convent.  She recalls that she was especially stirred at the prospect of doing missionary work.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sr. Murphy describes her first foreign mission was to the Bahamas.  She worked in education, but during her tenure, she noticed the stark difference between the lives of the native poor and the tourists who visited the Bahamas.  This started her personal quest for a better understanding of social justice principles.  She talks about her appointment as Mission Coordinator for the order, and how she was able to visit missions in Guatemala.  She recalls meeting with a fellow sister named Barbara Ann Ford, who was influential in creating water projects in the poor villages and who participated in The Recovery of Historical Memory project organized by Bishop Juan Geraldi to collect the stories of the survivors and victims of the civil war in Guatemala.  Part of the project included providing mental health service for those who were affected by the rampant violence and crime that accompanied the war.  Sr. Barbara was shot and killed in 2001 under suspicious circumstance, however her work in Guatemala helped many and also influenced Sister Regina Murphy.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">She describes how her experiences in the Bahamas and Guatemala along with the coming of Vatican II sparked an awakening in her.  She saw the changes enacted as part of Vatican II as an energizing and necessary force in the Church.  It seemed to her that religious work evolved from seeking to help individuals on a day to day basis to fixing the societal infrastructure responsible for basic injustices.  These realizations propelled Sister Regina Murphy to become involved in justice, peace, and corporate responsibility projects.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">When advocating for corporate responsibility, Sister Regina Murphy describes her integral role in the implementation of the McBride Principles and the enactment of the Fair Employment Act in Northern Ireland in 1988.  As part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, she traveled to Northern Ireland in the hopes of getting factories to sign onto the McBride Principles.  She recalls that the ICCR was successful in obtaining the signatures of fifty companies.  While Sister Regina Murphy was in one General Motors Factory in Northern Ireland, she talks about how her presence caused a temporary strike and shutdown of the factory.  Although she was not dressed in a traditional habit, workers guessed that she was a Catholic nun.  Seeing her discuss workplace issues with managers in the factory upset the predominately Protestant workers, inciting them to walk off the job.  Despite this fervor against the McBride Principles, it was her support, along with that of the ICCR, that she says helped to pass the Fair Employment Act.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Murphy talks about the current state of vocations in the Church and what she sees for the future of the convent. She describes her life today as a religious woman – what it means to her and what her Irish identity means.  She ends the interview talking about her job as property manager for the order, acting as general contractor on major construction projects for the order</field>
