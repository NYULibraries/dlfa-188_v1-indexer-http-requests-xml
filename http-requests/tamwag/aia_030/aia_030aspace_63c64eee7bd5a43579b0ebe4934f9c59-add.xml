    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Íde B. O'Carroll at Debbie McGoldrick's office at the Irish Voice in New York, New York on April 22, 2016.  The interview covers McGoldrick's family and her working life.  McGoldrick discusses her parents, their immigration experiences, and their working lives.  She discusses her relationship with Ireland and her desire to find a job related to Irish culture.  McGoldrick recounts her experiences as a reporter and editor at New York's two main Irish newspapers, the Irish Echo and the Irish Voice between the 1980s and the time of the interview.  She discusses the differences between the two newspapers, including their audiences, and the role the newspapers served for new Irish immigrants.  She discusses her weekly "Green Card" column at the Irish Voice, the support she received from James O'Malley on legal matters, and the fact that the column was a vital source of information for Irish immigrants in the 1990s.  She recounts her involvement in immigration reform organizations in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, and the relationships between the two newspapers and this movement.  She also discusses the decline in readership for print newspapers, the future of the Irish Voice with the rise of online news sources, and the relationship between the Irish Voice and the online new source IrishCentral.</field>
