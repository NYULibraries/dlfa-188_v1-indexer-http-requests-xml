    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Hilary Beirne was interviewed on the 26th of October, 2009 at the Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by James Herron and Linda Dowling Almeida. The topics discussed were wide and varied, starting with his background, growing up in County Roscommon, Ireland and following through his life from college days to working in Ireland in the 1970s and '80s to immigrating to the United States in the late '80s and ending with his distinguished work with the St. Patrick's Day Parade.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Beirne discusses his early life, growing up with nine brothers and sisters in a large farmhouse that his father, a veterinary surgeon, purchased around the time Beirne was born. He talks about his experiences in National School, and the effects that the small learning community, corporal punishment, and religious doctrine had on his education. He went to secondary school, earning high enough marks to attend college and earn a degree in agricultural studies. He discusses his first few jobs in Ireland, where he worked on projects that redesigned the way Irish farms operate and store various crops. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">He eventually left his job and immigrated to the U.S. to become a science teacher in the Bronx. It was at this time that he became involved in the New York City St. Patrick's Day Parade, upon which a large portion of this interview is based. Beirne discusses the finances, the history, the operations and the future of the parade in great detail. He provides an excellent behind-the-scenes view of the production of one of the largest parades in the world. Beirne also discusses, in great detail, the various other Irish fraternal clubs of which he is a member.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As a teacher, Beirne discusses his instructing methods and how he engages the student. He also spends time discussing how he became a teacher and the reasons why. He also talks about what he thinks makes a good teacher, and the necessary traits to perform the job well.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">He then returns to a broader discussion on why Irish-American heritage is important to this country, stating, "40 million Americans trace their heritage back to Irelandâ€¦" in order to show just how important the parade is.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Throughout the interview, Beirne takes breaks from discussing his life and the parade to talk about his family. He discusses his twin brother and the unique skills he possesses that his twin does not and vice versa. He discusses the odd relationship his siblings (2 brothers, 7 sisters) had with his parents, specifically, the love and strong bond they all had with their mother and poor relationship they had with their father. He also talks about the day he left Ireland and the effects his leaving had on his mother. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 2 hours and 28 minutes long, on 3 CDs.  The interview took place on October 29, 2009, and the interviewers were James Herron and Linda Dowling Almedia.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hilary Beirne (b. Boyle, Co. Roscommon, 1961) is a science teacher who emigrated to New York in 1988. He is a longtime member of the New York St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee and the nephew of the late Frank Beirne.</field>
