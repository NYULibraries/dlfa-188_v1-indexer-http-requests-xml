    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Íde B. O'Carroll at the Irish International Immigration Center in Boston, Massachusetts on March 11, 2015.  The interview covers Ronnie Millar's early life in Northern Ireland, his experiences of The Troubles in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s, and his working life.  Millar describes his parents and his siblings, and describes his family's identity as a mixed family, as his father was Protestant and his mother was Catholic. He recounts his family's moves between Ireland and England in the 1960s and 1970s and the lack of safety Millar felt as a child.  He recounts numerous stories about his experiences of The Troubles in Antrim, Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s, including being evacuated from buildings and encountering violence during his daily life. He discusses leaving school around 1979 and entering the punk rock scene in Belfast.  He discusses the impact of his participation in the punk scene on his family, his decision to take an apprenticeship in 1982, and the fact that these events led him to reflect upon his religious faith. He discusses his decision to immigrate to the United States in 1995, his experiences of the differences between the Boston area and Belfast, and his appreciation of the opportunity to experience something different.  He describes the work of the Irish International Immigration Center and details their programs and services.</field>
