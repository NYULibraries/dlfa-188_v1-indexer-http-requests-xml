    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sexton provides detailed information primarily on his youth and family life, from 1942 to 1975.  Sexton's grandfather, James J. Sexton (1875-1947), was born in County Sligo (near the border with Donegal), Ireland, the son of the village blacksmith.  He came to the United States at the age of 20 and settled in Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as a blacksmith and became an active member and eventual president of the International Union of Journeymen Horseshoers.  James Sexton entered local politics in 1915 as Democratic District leader in the Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and by 1929 was serving Mayor James J. Walker as President of the New York City Board of Taxes and Assessments.  Sexton gives an example of his grandfather's character and influence during the Depression while head of Brooklyn's Jefferson Democratic Club.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sexton's father, John E. Sexton, a graduate of Manhattan College and Fordham University Law School, died in 1960 when his son was eighteen, after years battling the effects of alcoholism.  He discusses the good and bad experiences he had as a child, including hardships resulting from the chronic ill health of his father.  Sexton describes how his father taught him the value of helping other people by bringing home what Sexton refers to as "handymen."  Rather than renting out the extra room in their house, Sexton's father would take in homeless men who were frequently recovering alcoholics and allow them to stay until they got back on their feet.  Sexton acknowledges the centrality of his relationship with his father to subsequent choices he made in life, and briefly talks about his strained relationship with his uncle Jim Sexton.  He attributes his knowledge of his Irish heritage to his aunt Ruth Sexton (Sr. James Marie), a Dominican nun.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">While remaining closest to his mother's German family, Sexton personally identifies himself as Irish. He talks about the pastor-like persona of all the Sexton men in his family and how readily it translates to his current position as President of New York University and Dean of its Law School before that.  Sexton attributes this love of people to being Irish and says this was passed down to him by his father.  Although he refers throughout the interview to the NYU Law School as his "parish" and the university as his "archdiocese," Sexton does not otherwise agree with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. He discusses his personal concept of Catholicism and his relationship with the Church, reflecting on the Jewish identity of his wife, children and grandchildren.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">He describes his education and work experience, especially his time at Fordham University and St. Francis College.  Following his father's death, Sexton began coaching a debate team at St. Brendan's Diocesan High School for girls where his sister was enrolled.  He talks extensively about the fifteen years he spent with the debate team, the significance of the experience both for him and for the girls he coached, and describes the first reunion the team had recently.   He credits one of his teachers at Brooklyn Prep, Charlie Winans, with being the inspiration behind his efforts with the St. Brendan's debaters.  He recounts how his first application to Harvard Law School was rejected and how his friend, Lawrence Tribe, called in a few favors, convincing the admissions department to give his application reconsideration; nevertheless, Sexton's commitment to St. Brendan's was so great that he deferred going to law school until 1975.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Fifty-three minutes into this oral history, Edward C. Smith, general auditor and senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, arrives for a meeting and Sexton invites him to listen in on the remainder of the interview.  He asks Smith if there is a demonstration outside, which is a reference to the rally organized by the United Auto Workers in support of striking NYU graduate assistants that was scheduled for noon that day outside Bobst Library.    This is the second brief reference Sexton makes to the strike during this interview.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">John E. Sexton was interviewed in his academic office in Vanderbilt Hall at New York University School of Law on 2 December 2005 by Shawna C. Meechan and Marion R. Casey. This oral history with John E. Sexton was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420.  Interview is 71 minutes, 56 seconds long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</field>
