    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this oral history Cassidy, author and scholar, traces the link between his family history his involvement in Irish Studies, and the origins of his research which culminated in How the Irish Invented Slang.  In a largely chronological manner, Cassidy starts by discussing his Brooklyn roots; his parents; his education; Vietnam; his battle with drugs and twenty-three month stay at Phoenix House; friendships with comedian George Carlin and musician Kenny Rankin; and the meaning of Irish identity. After starting off with a clear New York/East Coast focus, the narrative then shifts geographically to Cassidy's life in California and most particularly in San Francisco. Topics like his writing (his screenplay, The Volunteer, was sold to Francis Ford Coppola), labor organizing, and his move into teaching are covered. Cassidy engages in a detailed discussion of language and slang, in the context of Irish American culture, with his long-time friend Peter Quinn, author of Banished Children of Eve. Cassidy provides an insider's perspective on the day JFK was assassinated as a rookie journalist in the newsroom of the New York Times. The interview concludes with Cassidy emphasizing the extent to which Irish American scholarship awaits thorough excavation, by contending that immense research potential sits like 'gold nuggets' on the ground.</field>
