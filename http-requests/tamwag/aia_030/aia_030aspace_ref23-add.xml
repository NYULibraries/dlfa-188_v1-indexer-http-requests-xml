    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Eithne begins by talking about the family backgrounds of her parents, Peter Golden and Helen Merriam, who met while performing in A Comedy of Errors with Ben Greet's Elizabethan Society of England.  She recounts incidents from the family's time in the Amsterdam Avenue apartment, such as visits by Irish nationalists like the poet Joseph Campbell (1879-1944) and Eamon De Valera as well as members of the Friends of Freedom for India.  Purnendu Sinha apparently was admired for his ability to "carry the nappies in from the line so elegantly."  Eithne has only one clear memory of her father, when he tried to cure her earache with castor oil.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Eithne discusses her mother, Helen Merriam, in great depth, describing her as a "bohemian, a maverick," and the "black sheep of the family." She repeats a favorite anecdote from Christmas 1918 that her mother obviously relished telling the Golden children.  She describes the family's move to Pasadena, California, where Helen sold books at Brentano's until Ernie O'Malley convinced the family to relocate to Taos, New Mexico in 1931. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In Taos, Eithne met various artists and local Pueblo Indians, even dancing with Thornton Wilder (1897-1975) at the home of Mabel Dodge Luhan (1879-1962). Alexandra Belkovitch (d. 1983), wife of painter Nicolai Fechin (1881-1955), taught her Russian lullabies that would later inspire her lifelong passion for foreign languages.   Every day O'Malley tutored the Golden children and a local Mexican girl named Aurora in subjects ranging from grammar to geography; Eithne claims he called the Goldens the "stupidest children in the world" despite her fond memories of these sessions.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">As a result, Eithne moved to New Jersey to live with friends while pursuing an opera career in New York City in 1938. Her beloved Aunt Pat, her father's sister, greeted her at Pennsylvania Station, she recalls. But she quickly set her musical ambitions aside. By 1940, she moved to Lisbon, Portugal to work as a Foreign Service clerk, translating for the legation during World War II, she explains.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Eithne then discusses her time exploring the local music scene in Lisbon, which was cut short when she returned home to Taos to her ailing mother who was sick with cancer. After her mother's death in 1943, Eithne moved to New York City's East Village. She describes her experience working for a local group of Basque sympathizers, and she discusses a past love interest, Antonio Irela, the Secretary of the President of the Autonomous Basque Republic, Ant√≥n de Irala   Basque government delegate to the United States</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> Eithne also touches upon her musical pursuits, as she co-founded the New York Society of Classical Guitar in 1946, as well as the Guitar Review magazine.   </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the next part of the interview, Eithne describes her experience working for the United Nations as a translator beginning in 1949. She met her future husband, Ernie Sax, at a United Nations party in 1956, and admits that she thought Sax was a snob after their first meeting and that he "looked down on us girls." But a few weeks later, when Sax was hospitalized after a car accident, she visited him in the hospital, which Eithne claims was the start of a "great love affair." Eithne and Ernie Sax married that same year.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the small remainder of the interview, Eithne explores the idea of Irish identity, and she discusses her trip to Ireland in 1959. Eithne describes her life after her husband's death in 1969, and details her current pursuits, explaining that she takes Irish language classes and attends events at the Glucksman Ireland House. Finally, Eithne explains that she is currently writing her memoirs.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Eithne Merriam Golden Sax was interviewed on 2 November 2006 at her home on in New York City's upper east side by Elizabeth Bedell and Marion R. Casey. This oral history with Eithne Merriam Golden Sax was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 140 minutes long, on two CDs and has been logged at ten-minute intervals.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Eithne Golden Sax (b. 1919) is a retired multilingual translator for the United Nations, daughter of Irish nationalist organizer Peter Golden, and pupil of Irish republican author Ernie O'Malley.</field>
