    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Íde B. O'Carroll at the Irish Pastoral Center in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts on April 11, 2016.  The interview covers Father Dan Finn's family and his experiences as a priest in Boston for over 35 years. Father Finn describes his family, his childhood and early education in Ireland, and his family's immigration to the United States in 1960s.  He describes his vocation and his religious education and training at Cardinal O'Connell Seminary in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, and later St. John's Seminary in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston. He describes the changes in the ethnic and cultural composition of the congregation at St. Mark's between the 1980s and the time of the interview, from largely Irish and Irish American to Vietnamese, Haitian, and Dominican.  He recounts his involvement in the immigration reform movement in Boston, starting in 1987 with his introduction to the situation of undocumented Irish immigrants with Sister Veronica Dobson and his involvement with the Irish Immigration Reform Movement. Father Finn also discusses his involvement in the Greater Boston Interfaith Organisation, his focus on building connections in the community, and his participation in the Gaelic Athletic Association.</field>
