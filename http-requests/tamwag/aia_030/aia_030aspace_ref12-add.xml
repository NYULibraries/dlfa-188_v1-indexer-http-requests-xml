    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Theresa begins the discussion with a description of her parents lives in Ballinlough, County Roscommon, Ireland.  She includes information such as what life was like there in general, as well as the work involved with owning a family farm.  She recalls that her parents lived on the same street but came over to America separately and for different reasons in the early 1920s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Theresa talks about her parents' occupations after arriving in America.  Her mother worked as a housekeeper and was later promoted to cook.  Her father's occupation as a police officer in combination with her mother's strong money management enabled the couple to buy their own home.  This was the house that Sister grew up in the Brooklyn, New York neighborhood of Bushwick with her two older siblings, James and Mary Anne.  When Sister was five, her older brother left to attend the seminary, St. Joseph's College in Princeton, New Jersey, eventually fulfilling his passion and becoming ordained as a Vincentian priest.  Sister explains the differences between Vincentian and diocesan priests, and goes on to describe a typical day for a priest and his duties in general.  </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Theresa attended the single-sex Catholic educational institution St. John the Baptist grammar school.   She went on to attend Bishop McDonnell Memorial High School in Brookyln, also a single-sex Catholic school.  Sister Theresa mentions that being around religious figures her whole life played a part in motivating her to become a nun.  However, after graduating in 1952, she was not yet sure of what she wanted to do, and went on to work in the accounting department at Pfizer Incorporated.  After five years, in 1957, Sister Theresa chose to join the Brooklyn Sisters of Mercy.  She talks about her various assignments at different schools, ranging from her first teaching assignment in Sunnyside, Queens, to a librarian at St. Patrick's on Kent Avenue in Brooklyn, as well as her work as principal at Our Lady of Refuge in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">It was during her assignment at St. Patrick's on Kent Avenue that Vatican II occurred.  Sister Theresa describes the changes she saw in the Church, the effects the movement had on Catholic educations and the habit, as well as on the convent itself and the women within it. Sister's opinion of the reforms were mostly negative.  She believes that before Vatican II the women in the convent had a strict schedule that was followed, and without that kind of structure the women felt lost; she points to this as one of the changes that provoked many women to leave.  She also disliked the changes in the habit.  She discusses in detail the full habit nuns used to wear before Vatican II, as well as why she enjoyed wearing it and why she still wears the modified habit today, even though it is not a requirement.  However, she does mention that she enjoyed the new freedom nuns had to vacation and visit family whenever they chose, as compared to before when time away from the convent was limited.  She describes her family's home in Breezy Point, Queens, and the joy it brought her to be able to go back there for vacations.  Sister also discusses the effects Vatican II had on the convent, the Church and religion in general, as well as its impact on Catholic educations. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Theresa also discusses her Irish identity throughout the interview.  She remembers listening to the Irish radio stations with her mother, and mentions that her sister took Irish dancing classes.  She describes her Irishness as being inherent, and something that has always simply been a part of her.  When asked about her Irish-American identity she explains that although she does not necessarily think about it, she knows she is Irish, and describes herself as more Irish than American, but that the greatness of America is also simply a part of who she is.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Sister Theresa ends with a discussion about her current position at Our Lady of Mercy Academy in Syosset, New York, as event coordinator, where she organizes school events and fundraisers.  She mentions the various events she handles yearly and the amount of money raised at some of them. </field>
