O'Carroll at Gerry Brennan's home in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts on August 16, 2016.  The interview covers Brennan's early life in Ireland and his working life in the United States (US). Brennan discusses his family, including the education and working life of his parents.  He recounts immigrating to the US in 1973, settling in Boston, and establishing a painting and renovation business with his brother.

He describes the bars he owned in Boston, including the Brendan Behan Pub in Jamaica Plain and the Thirsty Scholar in Cambridge, and discusses the role of these bars in the Irish and Irish American culture in the Boston area.  Brennan also discusses his real estate investments in County Kildare, Ireland and the work ethic his parents instilled in him and his siblings.</field>
