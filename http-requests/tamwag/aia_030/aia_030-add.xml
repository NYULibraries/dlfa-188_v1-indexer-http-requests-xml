    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Ireland House Oral History Collection contains interviews of Irish and Irish Americans conducted between 2005 and 2017 by undergraduates, doctoral students, and faculty in the Irish Studies program at New York University, as well as staff of the Glucksman Ireland House.  The oral histories document the lives of people born between the 1910s and 1980s, working in Ireland and the United States (U.S.) as diplomats, business owners, laborers, educators, journalists, lawyers, members of Catholic orders, politicians, musicians, and actors.  The interviews were conducted in Ireland and in the U.S., mainly in English, with at least one interview conducted in Irish.  Topics covered include childhood, education, family life, immigration experience, working life, political activity, and cultural activity.  Many of the narrators were active in immigration reform, Irish republican politics, and the Irish American community in New York City and other American cities with large Irish American populations.</field>
