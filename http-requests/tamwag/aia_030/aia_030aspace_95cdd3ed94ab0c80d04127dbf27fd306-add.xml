    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This interview was conducted by Íde B. O'Carroll in Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland on July 17, 2014.  The interview covers Anne Rath's early life and education in Ireland, her immigration to the United States in 1986, and her work as a college professor in Ireland in the 1990s and 2000s.  Rath discusses her childhood in rural Ballycanew in County Wexford, Ireland, including her parents, their childhoods and professions. She discusses her work as a teacher in Cork, deciding to receive extra training in guidance counselling, and visiting Boston, Massachusetts in the summer of 1986.  She recalls working various jobs in the summer of 1986 before working at the British Consulate. She recounts her decision to return to Ireland in 1996, the difficulties she and her family faced with adjusting to the move, and the issues she faced returning to teaching. In particular she discusses the difficulties being a working mother with young children in Ireland, the lack of social life in Ireland for Rath and her partner, and the difficulties the family faced in adjusting to the differences in life, work, and school between the US and Ireland.</field>
