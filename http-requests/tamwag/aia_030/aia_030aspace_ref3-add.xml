    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burns was born in Woodside, Queens, but grew up in Valley Stream, Long Island, which he affectionately calls "the burbs," referring to the area as a suburb of New York City. He discusses his experience as a young Irish Catholic and his impressions and memories of a suburban childhood. Particularly interesting are his childhood revelations of being Irish. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burns describes the family history, as he knows it, of his mother and father. He details his mother's childhood, as the daughter of Irish immigrants, growing up without a mother and a father who worked as a sandhog and who was often absent. He believes that his father's family emigrated from Ireland during the potato famine. Burns traces the professions of his various paternal relatives, including a great-grandfather who owned a horse and carriage trucking company on the west side of Manhattan.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burns explains the process of making The Brothers McMullen and the various challenges that he faced in shooting the film on a low budget. He tells a few stories of the more unique things he had to do to get "the shot", including sneaking into a graveyard. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burns took The Brothers McMullen to the Sundance Film Festival in 1995. Burns' retelling of his acceptance to Sundance is particularly interesting and at the end of his story, Burns notes "Print the legend." The Brothers McMullen won the Grand Jury Prize, which is the equivalent of the Oscar for Best Picture. Burns relates his memories of winning the actual award and all the strangeness that he felt in the moments after the announcement, including a possible embrace with "Sam Jackson", the actor Samuel L. Jackson to the rest of us.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burns also discusses the roles of the Irish in entertainment and how they are portrayed in movies and television. Remarking about the Irish content and references in The Brothers McMullen, "none of this has been in a film, so I'm going to put all of it in" almost to the point of going overboard. He also discusses prominent Irish authors whose work he enjoys. Burns explains that he has attempted to adapt a couple of Irish-American novels into films, but to date none have worked. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burns continues to discuss the portrayal of Irish Americans on film and television. He notes that most of the Irish-American characters on film and television tend to be police officers, fire fighters or other stereotypically Irish professions. What Burns says had not been portrayed before was an Irish-American family and their everyday existence. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Burns discusses his family's drive for the next generation to leave the New York suburbs and return to Manhattan, which Burns has done. Burns' father pushed Burns and his brother to attend college and to pursue the American dream of "doing better" than the previous generation. Burns juxtaposes this ambition with the fact that none of the parents of his friends in Valley Stream had gone to college. He draws the analogy of his own social climbing to the old saying "When your grandfather came here there were signs that said 'No Irish Need Apply' and in 1963 we put JFK in the White House." </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Near the conclusion of the interview, Burns defines what his perception of Irish American is and what it means to him.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Edward Burns was interviewed on October 30, 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Callan Stout, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joe Ready. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour and 25 minutes long, recorded on two CDs and has been broken into tracks of ten-minute segments. </field>
