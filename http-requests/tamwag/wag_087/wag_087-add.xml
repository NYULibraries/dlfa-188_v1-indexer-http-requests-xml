    <field name="abstract_teim">Burton Hall was an attorney in New York who set up practice in 1960 as a labor lawyer. He began by handling a union insurgency case which then led to others, so that his practice was almost entirely comprised of representing rank-and-file members suing to protect their democratic rights within their unions. The collection principally consists of legal case files, including affidavits, depositions, motions, District Court and appellate briefs, exhibits, appendices, transcripts and correspondence. The collection provides a wealth of information about the politics and culture of rank-and-file organizing.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents approximately thirty years of the union democracy movement, from the 1960s to the 1990s. It provides an opportunity to examine the development of a significant portion of the case law which gave meaning and substance to the rights guaranteed by the Landrum-Griffin Act, also known as the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The legal records, include affidavits, depositions, motions, District Court and appellate briefs, exhibits, appendices, transcripts, and correspondence. These materials provide a wealth of information about the politics and culture of rank-and-file organizing in general and rank-and-file organizing within specific unions. Additionally, the newspapers, flyers, programs, platforms, campaign literature, reports, annotated minutes, correspondence, and a small number of photographs provide a rich data base for documenting the vital sub-culture of union insurgents, as many of the cases stemmed from an individual who was part of some organized opposition group. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Of particular note is the correspondence found in the collection. Burton Hall maintained a lively correspondence with those he represented. The letters from John Cole, Seafarer (Cole v. Paul Hall, SIU); Harold Robbins, Painter, District Council 9 (former bodyguard to Trotsky); and those to the plaintiffs in Gordon v. Winpisinger (IAM) are outstanding examples. The collection contains a vast amount of correspondence wherein Hall would lay out a legal argument, either to a Judge sitting on one of his cases, to the opposing Counsel, or to one of the many attorneys who wrote seeking his expert advice, or copies of his briefs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Burton Hall (1929-1991) was born in South Orange, New Jersey in 1929. He graduated from Williams College in 1951 and Yale Law School in 1954. While in college and law school, Hall was a member of the Food, Tobacco and Agricultural Workers Union in Camden, New Jersey, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Local 11, and the International Association of Machinists, Local 751, on the West Coast. He served in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1956. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1957 and worked as a lawyer for a private firm and the Federal Aviation Agency before turning to labor law.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hall set up his own practice in 1960 as a labor lawyer. Unintentionally at first, he found himself handling a union insurgency case which then led to others, so that his practice was almost entirely comprised of representing rank-and-file members suing to protect their democratic rights within their unions.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">His office was located at 136 Liberty Street in Lower Manhattan. When the building was demolished to make way for the World Trade Center, he moved to 401 Broadway. His firm, Hall, Clifton &amp; Schwartz, formed in 1980. Wendy Sloan became an associate in 1982 and the firm of Hall &amp; Sloan was formed in 1984.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Hall was one of the pioneer attorneys in developing the case law for the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act. His precedent-setting cases involved protection of the rights guaranteed by law in the section of the Act known as the "Bill of Rights" of union members. For instance, in Salzhandler v. Caputo, one of the earliest of the many disciplinary cases litigated by Hall for members of the Painters' Union, Hall articulated the right of free speech in unions in broad and unequivocal terms. Salzhandler was the first of many landmark cases which established legal protection for the rights of union members. Hall represented rank-and-filers in numerous cases involving issues such as eligibility for running for union office, discipline against members for criticism of their leadership, and expulsion of union members for advocating radical political ideas.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Burton Hall died in 1991 at age 61.</field>
