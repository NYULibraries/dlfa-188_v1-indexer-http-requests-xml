    <field name="abstract_teim">The Printed Ephemera Collection on the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) is an artificial collection, collected and assembled by the Tamiment Library over the course of several decades. The CIO was founded in 1935 as part of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and known as the Committee for Industrial Organization. Formalizing a break with the AFL over disputes in how to organize industrial workers, the CIO held its first convention in 1938, and it was there that it changed its name to the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The collection consists of contracts, agreements, and constitutions, as well as printed ephemera such as fliers, brochures, leaflets, newspaper clippings, pamphlets and other publications. Material comes from the international and national body of the CIO but also its regional, state, and city councils, most notably, the Greater New York CIO Council and the New York State Industrial Union Council.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) was originally conceived in 1935 within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) as the Committee for Industrial Organization. After formalizing a break with the AFL, stemming from disagreements in how to organize industrial workers, the CIO established itself an independent federation in 1938. John L. Lewis was an influential force and served as president until 1940, when Philip Murray of the United Steelworkers of America succeeded him. The first unions chartered by the CIO were the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, the United Mine Workers of America, and the United Steelworkers of America. In 1955, the AFL, under the leadership of George Meany, merged with the CIO, led by Walter Reuther. As of 2009, the AFL-CIO represented over 11 million members.</field>
