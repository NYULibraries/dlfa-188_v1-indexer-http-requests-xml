    <field name="abstract_teim">Olive Tilford Dargan (1869-1968), was an Appalachian poet and novelist. Under the pseudonym Fielding Burke, she wrote two novels about the Gastonia, North Carolina textile workers' strike of 1929, Call Home the Heart (1932) and A Stone Came Rolling (1935). Rose Pastor Stokes (1879-1933) was a widely published socialist and communist, and author of proletarian plays and poetry. Born in Russian Poland in 1879, Stokes immigrated to the United States where she worked in a cigar factory. In 1903 she became an assistant to the editor of the Jewish Daily News in New York. In 1905 she married James Graham Phelps Stokes, a wealthy socialist and reformer. In 1918 she was sentenced to ten years in prison under the Espionage Act but the conviction was overturned on appeal. During this period she became a member of the Communist Party and in 1922 was a delegate to the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Moscow. In 1925 she and James were divorced and two years later she married Jerome Isaac Romaine. She died in 1933 of cancer. The collection contains forty-one letters from Olive Tilford Dargan to Rose Pastor Stokes, two letters from Stokes to Dargan, a letter from the Tallahassee Power Company regarding the possibility of a reservoir covering some property owned by Dargan, and a telegram to Dargan from "John and Mary." The letters between Dargan and Stokes are largely personal in nature, and indicate a close friendship. There is also some discussion of literary and political matters, and the letters from 1930-1931 are concerned with Stoke's final illness.</field>
