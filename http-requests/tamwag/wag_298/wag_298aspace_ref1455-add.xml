    <field name="scopecontent_teim">District Council 1707 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) is the only council within AFSCME that is chartered exclusively to represent private, nonprofit employees. From 2007-2013 the website contained information and news from the locals that made up the council--Local 95, Local 107, Local 205, Local 215, Local 253, Local 389, and retirees chapter. It also included news, issues of the Voice Notes, committee information for the political action committee, the Latino committee,  Women's committee, and Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, as well as class and workshop details for steward and organizing training and membership benefits. In 2013, the website underwent a redesign to a blog format. The website mostly consisted of news and press releases from the Council, president and executive director addresses to membership, photo galleries, local and committee overviews, and information on classes and workshops. In 2015, the website was redesigned again and the captures up until 2017 are mostly not navigable, only news blurbs, headlines, and calendar are available. The last redesign occured in 2018. The website contained news, class and workshop registrations, political action meetings, photo galleries, employment opportunities, board members, and a calendar. News covered includes negotiation updates, marches and rallies, convertion news, obituaries, and leadership updates.In late 2019, DC 1707 merged with DC 37. The website ceased to exist circa 2020-2021.</field>
