    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I contains the records related to the administration of the JLC at the national level. The national bodies documented in the form of minutes, agendas, and memoranda, correspondence, and form mailings include the Executive Board/National Executive Board, the National Executive Committee, the Office Committee, the Administrative Committee, and others.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The JLC's fundraising efforts are documented in the allocations correspondence sent to local Jewish federations, national welfare funds, and other organizations, arranged chronologically, by city and/or region, and by the type of organization being solicited. The series also contains reports and mailings prepared by the JLC to the Large City Budgeting Conference (later the National Funding Councils) of the Council of Jewish Federations and Welfare Funds (renamed the Council of Jewish Federations in 1979) in support of its funding requests. These reports and mailings call out what the JLC perceived as the highlights of its activities during the represented years. Similarly, financial reports and ledgers, many compiled by Arthur Goldberg, document the JLC's expenses and track its attempts to solicit allocations from local welfare funds.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Records from the JLC biennial conventions reflect the evolution of the JLC's standpoints on various issues. Speeches and biographies of speakers, reports, publicity, lists of delegates, minutes and other material produced by various committees, correspondence, and other documents demonstrate the planning behind the conventions and the events that took place at each meeting. In particular, the resolutions drafted and approved at the conventions provide an apt summary of the issues that the JLC emphasized throughout the twentieth century and document the changes in its priorities. (Additional resolutions may be found in Series II.) There is also a small amount of administrative material related to the creation of the JLC's biennial convention journals. The journals themselves are cataloged separately and are searchable via NYU's online catalog, Bobcat.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A few files relate to the Atran Center's moves to new headquarters in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Materials in Box 441 are likely the office files of May "Mazie" Vladeck Bromberg, a member of the JLC staff and daughter of the JLC's founder, Baruch Charney Vladeck.</field>
