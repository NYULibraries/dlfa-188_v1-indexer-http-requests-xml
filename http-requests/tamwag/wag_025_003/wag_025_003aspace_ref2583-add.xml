    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of the Jewish Labour Committee, Canada reflect the organization's parallels to the U.S. JLC in its affiliations and activities, particularly in its anti-discrimination campaigns. The series includes minutes of the Canadian JLC's governing bodies, reports and press releases created by the Canadian Jewish Congress and the Canadian Labour Congress, correspondence with the U.S. JLC, and convention materials. The largest group of files concerning local activities is devoted to Montreal, whose large Jewish community (including many Holocaust survivors) had close ties to the JLC in the United States. The series also contains material on labor and civil rights issues in Canada more generally.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Jewish Labour Committee, Canada was founded in 1936. Like the U.S. JLC, the Canadian JLC was heavily involved in relief efforts during and in the aftermath of World War II, both by providing aid in Europe and sponsoring refugees who came to Canada. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the post-war period, the organization focused on combatting discrimination in Canadian society. Various laws prohibiting discrimination in areas such as housing, education, race, and employment were passed in response to the Canadian JLC's investigations and other forms of activism. In 1947, the Canadian JLC merged with the Joint Public Relations Committee to form the Joint Advisory Committee on Labour Relations, with JLC Executive Director Kalmen Kaplansky as its leader.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Canadian JLC dissolved in 1978.</field>
