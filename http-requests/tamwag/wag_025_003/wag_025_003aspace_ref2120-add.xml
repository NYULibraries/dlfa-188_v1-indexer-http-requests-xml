    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series mainly contains publicity materials, expense reports, and local correspondence and memoranda generated or collected by the JLC's local leadership, both its main regional offices and its various chapters. The series also includes correspondence between local leadership and the national JLC, as well as activity reports submitted to the national office by the local leadership. The JLC's offices in Boston (the northeast regional office), Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles (the California regional office), Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. are particularly well-represented. Herman Brown, longtime director of the JLC Boston/Northeast Region office, was also heavily involved in the Boston district of the Workmen's Circle, and his correspondence, notes, and reports comprise a large portion of both groups' records. The records of the JLC's local chapters and regional offices provide an overview of local labor and anti-discrimination activity. Though the local JLC offices often mirror the national JLC in their campaigns and areas of advocacy, the local records also provide insight into issues specific or of particular importance to the localities represented.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">To a lesser extent, mostly financial material from the Boston branch of the JLC's Workmen's Circle division is also included, as are the records of the United Hebrew Trades (UHT), which became the New York division of the JLC in 1995. The UHT materials are primarily from the 2000s, but of particular note is the UHT's original charter from 1906.</field>
