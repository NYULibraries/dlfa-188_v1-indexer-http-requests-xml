    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This small series contains Richard Franke's writings on East Timor and Indonesia. It includes some of Franke's articles and manuscripts, as well as his reviews of other works on the subject. The manuscripts include a few early drafts of Franke's pamphlet entitled "East Timor: The Hidden War," issued by the East Timor Defense Committee in 1976. It details a brief history of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, the U.S military involvement in the conflict, Fretilin and the East Timorese' struggle for independence, and calls to action. The early drafts of this work contain inscription, including layout notes, and original photographs. There are also two copies of the final published pamphlet. Some of Franke's writings are accompanied with research material. This series also contains Franke's conference material from the Permanent People's Tribunal Session on East Timor which was held in Lisbon, Portugal on June 19-21, 1981. An oversized poster from this conference material was separated and placed in Series VII.</field>
