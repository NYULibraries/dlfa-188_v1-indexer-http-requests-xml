    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of records of International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, Local 1 of Brooklyn, New York and other locals it merged with, including Local 9 of Brooklyn, Local 41 of Woodside, Queens, and locals 21, 30, 31, 34, 37,  66 and 84. Materials and documents date from the 1880s to the 1990s and include ledger books, minutes, contracts, correspondence, photographs, scrapbooks, ephemera and audio recordings of meetings and conventions. Early ledgers of Locals 1 and 9 date from the 1880s to the 1930s and include minutes, dues records, expense and benefits books and apprentice lists. The collection also contains the archived website of Local 1, with captures ongoing since 2012.  Photographs include portraits of individual members, union events, and group portraits of union members from the 1920s to the 1980s. A 1940s-era scrapbook from Local 41 includes head shots and group portraits of union members and related clippings. A photograph album that appears to date from the 1920s-1930s includes approximately 105 small black and white head shots of union members with names written in pencil under each.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The National Union of Bricklayers of the U.S.A. was organized on October 16, 1865 and granted a charter to Local No. 1 in Brooklyn, New York, on October 17, 1868, making Local 1 one of the oldest continuously-existing locals in New York City. The National Union of Bricklayers was one of the first unions to support the eight-hour work day, a priority for delegates from its New York locals to its 1869 Convention. In 1881, the National Union of Bricklayers became an international union. A reorganized charter was granted in 1910 when the International became Bricklayers, Masons, and Plasterers International Union of America. In 1916, the union became affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. From its beginnings the union emphasized apprenticeship training, wages, working conditions, and benefits for union members and their families. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The union's records illustrate the early dominance of Irish American and Irish immigrant members in the union -- many of them sons of bricklayers. In the 1930s and 1940s members from Irish and Italian ethnic backgrounds clashed, as Irish membership dwindled, and Italian members brought in more family members. By the mid-1980s, union operations were run at the district and international level, rather than at the local level, and local politics and power became less important. In 1986, Local 1 had 447 members, half of whom were African American and Latino, and the remainder were mostly of Italian origin. During the 1980s and 1990s, the International operated a federally-funded program called the Job Corps for Disadvantaged Youth, which trained female as well as male apprentices for Local 1.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Since its founding, Local 1 merged with several other locals, including locals 9, 21, 30, 31, 34, 37, 41, 66 and 84. Local 1's members have worked on New York City landmarks such as Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building, the Metropolitan Life Building, the American Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Center, the Cloisters, the Frick Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and thousands of office and residential buildings.</field>
