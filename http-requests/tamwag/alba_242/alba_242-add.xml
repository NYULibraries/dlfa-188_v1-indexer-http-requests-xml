    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Spanish Civil War Postcards and Trading Cards (1936-2000s) is comprised of over 400 postcards and trading cards related to the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). The materials in this collection were produced as visual propaganda to garner support for the Nationalists or the Republicans. Postcards were made by combatant groups, for example the Unión General de Trabajadores de España, and official propaganda ministries, as well as by humanitarian aid groups like the Red Cross, and organizations around the world who supported one side of the war, including the United Socialist Youth (Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas), which supported the Republicans. Some postcards were created to solicit donations, send to politicians, or draw attention to specific causes including refugee children and war prisoners. Most postcards in this collection were created by or in support of the Republican side of the conflict. Many of the postcards are in Catalan and were made by the Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya and the Commissariat de Propaganda de la Generalitat de Catalunya. Some postcards in the collection demonstrate support for the Basque Country (Euskadi). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection also includes some postcards from Spain that are not directly related to the Spanish Civil War, including postcards with photographs of Madrid, portraits of Catalonian men, and postcards depicting the traditional dress of various regions in Spain. There are also postcards depicting Spanish Civil War memorials, postcards created by the International Brigade Archives, and postcards made to publicize exhibitions of Spanish Civil War propaganda posters. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many postcards in this collection feature graphics in the Socialist realism style. Others were made using other methods of illustration, and a small number show photographs. Some postcards have notes written on them and were posted, but most of the postcards in this collection are blank. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Spanish Civil War Postcards and Trading Cards contains postcards and trading cards related to the 1936-1939 conflict between Spanish Nationalists under General Francisco Franco's military Junta and a coalition of socialist, communist, anarchist, and separatist groups known as the Republicans. Many of the groups who joined the Republicans were a part of the political left and had supported the Popular Front government of the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939).</field>
