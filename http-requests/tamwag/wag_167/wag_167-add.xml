    <field name="abstract_teim">The New York Building Congress (NYBC) is an association that brings together employers, labor unions, government agencies, engineers, architects, financiers, suppliers and others engaged in the construction industry in New York City. Founded in 1921, it now represents approximately 400 organizations, with a combined membership of over 250,000 skilled workers and professionals. The Congress engages in educational and lobbying activity, hosts public programs, and disseminates information on issues of concern to the industry. Additionally, the organization focuses on supporting sound public policy, promoting productive capital spending, encouraging public/private partnerships, and evaluating the implementation of major government projects in the construction sector. The collection consists of the administrative, general, and event files of the NYBC, as well as publications, photographs, and audio-visual materials produced by or for the organization. It documents the organization's role in establishing standards for construction through the Building Industry Practices Committee, as well as its important role in New York City legislative issues. The event files cover a variety of activities, from the lavishly produced Christmas shows and "Fun and Frolic" celebrations held from the 1930s through 1980s, to the conferences and issue-oriented forums that became a prominent feature of Congress activity in the 1990s and beyond.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Building Congress (NYBC) is an association that brings together employers, labor unions and federations, government agencies, engineers, architects, finaniers, suppiers and others engaged in the construction industry in New York City. Founded in 1921, it now has around 400 affiliated organizations, with a combined membership of over 250,000 skilled workers and professionals. The Congress engages in educational and lobbying activities, hosts public programs, and disseminates information of concern to the industry.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Shortly after the First World War, elements of the American building industry attempted to organize a national building congress. Although the planned national organization was never very active, the impulse was continued by city-wide groups. In New York City, the 47-member NYBC was organized in early 1921. Originally, membership was limited to organizations (labor unions, businesses, government agencies, etc.), but it was soon opened to individuals, and its early presidents were noted architects. On this broad basis, the NYBC united labor and employers, as well as members of the multitude of professions involved in all aspects of the building industry. One of the NYBC's key roles in its early years was to mediate between labor and management.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The NYBC issued a code of ethics for the building industry during its inaugural year, and remained actively involved in setting industry standards until the 1960s. The organization concerned itself with specific building practices; it commissioned research, published reports, lobbied, and spoke out on legislation and regulations pertaining to the industry. The NYBC took a leading role in the revision of the New York City Building Code in the 1960s and also lobbied on more general issues, such as the New York City charter revision of the late 1980s, the Westway project, and a variety of other development proposals for the city.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Over the years the organizational structure of the NYBC varied dramatically, as can be seen in the multitude of committees, subcommittees, councils, and boards listed in the inventory below. Nevertheless, some functions have remained consistent. From the beginning, the NYBC has regularly sponsored research, held conferences, presented awards to leaders in the industry, and hosted dinners and luncheons that have been addressed by some of New York's, and the nation's, most distinguished individuals.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Following the long presidencies of John J. Collins and Louis J. Coletti, the NYBC has been led by Richard T. Anderson since 1994. During this time, the Congress has frequently addressed legislative, regulatory, urban development, and political issues crucial to the industry. A recent Congress initiative was the establishment of the New York Building Foundation (NYBF), which undertakes industry research and philanthropic activities.</field>
