    <field name="abstract_teim">Marc Kagan is a union activist and educator who was a member and leader of the Transport Union Workers (TWU) Local 100 from 1984 through 2010. Kagan's union involvement increased during the 1990s, and he joined the New Directions caucus challenging the leadership of the TWU. In 2000, New Directions leader Roger Toussaint was elected union president, and Kagan became his chief of staff. In 2010, Kagan left the union over a dispute concerning the 2002 contract he helped negotiate. This collection documents the general operations of the TWU during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as Kagan's personal membership in and relationship with the organization as both a union member and its chief of staff. The majority of materials document the negotiations surrounding the 2002 union contract including grievances and implementation issues, as well as concerns about sick leave, health benefits, safety issues, apprenticeship implementation, and child care support. The files are both paper and electronic, though the bulk of the records are paper.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents the general operations of the Transport Workers Union (TWU) during the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as Kagan's personal membership in and relationship with the organization as both a union member and its chief of staff. Materials include memoranda, correspondence, oral histories, and newspaper clippings concerning negotiations about the 2002 union contract including grievances and implementation issues, as well as concerns about sick leave, health benefits, safety issues, apprenticeship implementation, and child care support. The electronic oral histories were conducted by Kagan and feature current and former TWU members on the subject of the New Directions opposition caucus and a 2005 TWU strike. The files are both paper and electronic, though the bulk of the records are paper.</field>
