    <field name="bioghist_teim">Christopher Dols was a former member and campaign organizer for the Campus Antiwar Network (CAN) while he was studying civil and environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin in the early 2000s. CAN is a college- and university-based antiwar network in the United States, initially founded during the onset of the Iraq War in late 2002 and early 2003. During the war, the student activists of CAN demanded the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, reparations to the Iraqi people, and an end to the United Nation sanctions they believed were harming the country. Other issues of focus included the occupation of Afghanistan and conflict in the West Bank, as well as broader social issues such as racial scapegoating, attacks on civil liberties, and government funding of the military over education, jobs, and healthcare. As of 2016, CAN members continue to protest military recruitment on college campuses by organizing speaking events with antiwar veterans, distributing pamphlets, and picketing military recruiters in schools.</field>
