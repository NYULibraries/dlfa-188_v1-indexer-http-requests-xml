    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series IIE: Miscellaneous, January 1938 - September 1938. Many of the 761 images in this series capture the final battles of the International Brigades. The most arresting shots are those taken at the crossing of the Ebro in July 1938. In an article that appeared in the Volunteer for Libertyin September 1938, Randall described the Photo Unit's activities and the photographic record they created during the Ebro Offensive:</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">"In the period of reorganization and training that preceded our crossing of the Ebro, we were busy snapping pictures of training schools, delegations, fiestas, activities, meetings, classes, congresses, etc. Then the moment came when we prepared to attack. Ben Katine took a fine set of pictures of our comrades crossing the river in boats and rafts of the building of the first footbridge and the first groups of our soldiers to walk across it to the west bank of the Ebro, ours once more. We went ahead with our troops as we advanced, and later made pictures of the ruins of towns bombed by the Fascist planes."</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also includes pictures of peasants working in the fields of Marca; the presentation of a flag by Juventud Socialista Unificada (Unified Socialist Youth of the Spanish Communist Party); and the evacuation of wounded in Gandesa.</field>
