    <field name="unittitle_teim">Series IV: Photographs, Artwork, and Ephemera</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The series consists of over one hundred black-and-white photographs of various sizes, two pieces of artwork including a drawing and silhouette of Abraham I. Shiplacoff, and a small amount of ephemera including tickets to Shiplacoff Day celebrations in the late-1930s, part of a 1915 New York State Assembly election poster picturing Shiplacoff, and a handmade card with poem to celebrate his 1915 election to the Assembly.
 
Photographs of Shiplacoff's political activities include group portraits from conventions, possibly Socialist, with B.C. Vladek, Alex Kahn, and Jacob Panken; a group of Socialist Assemblymen from 1918; and a Socialist delegation in Washington including Morris Hillquit, Panken, Jim Maurer, I.I. Hourwich, and Daniel Hoan. Other photographs include Shiplacoff with students as teacher at P.S. 84 in Brownsville, Brooklyn; in office as Labor Editor of the Jewish Daily Forward; at desk at New York State Assembly; as Deputy Collector of the Port at the Customs House; and studio portraits of Shiplacoff from different periods of his life. Approximately fifty photographs document a circa 1931 to trip to Palestine with a delegation on behalf of the National Labor Committee for Palestine.</field>
