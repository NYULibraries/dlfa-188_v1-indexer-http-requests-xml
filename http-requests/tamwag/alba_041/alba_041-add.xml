    <field name="abstract_teim">Isidore (Irving) Fishgold (1918-1938) was born in Brooklyn to parents who already had six children from earlier marriages. Irving spent much of his childhood alone with his mother, who separated from her husband, leaving the older children with him. From the age of fifteen Irving began to visit with his father and stepbrothers and sisters, with whom he became quite close. He graduated from high school and worked at various odd jobs, while becoming deeply involved in radical politics. He soon joined the Young Communist League.  When he volunteered for service with the International Brigades in Spain he reportedly dissuaded one of his brothers from doing the same, arguing that it was necessary to stay at home and work to help support the family.  Irving sailed from New York, according to his sister Betty's account, on February 23, 1938 and was killed in an ambush at Gandesa in July 1938. The collection consists of eight letters written from Spain by Fishgold to "folks" (presumably to both his parents, although they were long separated) and his sister Betty.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of eight letters written from Spain by Fishgold to "folks" (presumably to both his parents, although they were long separated) and his sister Betty. The letters describe his first journey through Spain by train, his training, meetings with friends from home, life in camp and in the front lines, and the beauties of the Spanish scenery.  Many passages convey messages to friends and family at home, ask for letters and packages, inquire about political and trade-union developments, and express concern for the well-being of his family.</field>
