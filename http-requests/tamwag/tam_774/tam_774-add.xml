    <field name="abstract_teim">The Chiapas Media Project Records (dated 1995-2010) consist of materials created and collected by Chiapas Media Project documenting its ongoing operations, film and video production and distribution, participation in film festivals, and engagement with indigenous communities. Materials in this collection include video recordings; correspondence with speakers, filmmakers, and festival organizers; newspaper and magazine clippings; academic research; notes and notebooks for the organization's projects; distribution and festival ephemera, including brochures, programs, posters, and catalogs; and objects, including a banner, t-shirts, and badges and press passes from festivals and conferences. The collection documents the ongoing activities of the Chiapas Media Project; the ability of indigenous and other marginalized communities to advocate for themselves through media; and topics and issues concerning indigenous human rights documented in individual works, such as agricultural collectives, indigenous land ownership claims, environmental sustainability, and the Zapatista indigenous movement.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Chiapas Media Project, founded in 1998 by Alexandra Halkin and Paco Vazquez, facilitated the production and distribution of media through four regional media centers built and equipped in collaboration with the Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico. The Chiapas Media Project collaboratively produced 32 documentaries which focus on issues such as indigenous sovereignty, indigenous cultural practices, environmental sustainability, sustainable food practices, and autonomous education. Their films and videos have been screened at over 120 film festivals in 20 countries between 1998 and 2010, as well as many college and university campuses and other locations across the globe. The Chiapas Media Project is now known as Promedios de Comunicación Comunitaria, and has been a part of the Americas Media Initiative since 2010. Promedios continues to work with indigenous and non-indigenous communities in Southern Mexico providing audiovisual training and technical support.</field>
