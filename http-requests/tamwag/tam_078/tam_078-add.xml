    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Morris Rosen Papers consist of an unpublished autobiographical typescript "Man Made Cliffs" (246 pp.) by Mike Ross (a pseudonym of Morris Rosen). After a brief biographical sketch of early life and family, the memoir is principally the account of the struggle within Local 376 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners between Rosen, a Communist and National Secretary of the Building Trades Section of the Trade Union Educational League, and the leadership. He was elected Business Agent of the Local in Dec 1925. The General Executive Board of the Carpenters Union revoked Local 376's charter in June 1926. The narrative ends with the depression in the building trades in 1929. The collection also contains articles written by "Mike Ross" on the struggle within the Carpenters Union that were featured in labor newspapers such as Labor Unity, The Progressive Builder, and the Daily Worker, 1924-1929. In addition there are several drafts of poems: "To Hell with Hoovers," and "Liberty," as well as a pamphlet "Appeal of Local Union 376 of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America" (1926).</field>
