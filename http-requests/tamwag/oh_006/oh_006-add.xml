    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains interviews of hospital workers conducted in 1979, including both recorded interviews on audiocassettes and interview transcripts. The interviewees are primarily women, with a few men represented as well. The creator of this collection and conductor of the interviews are unknown. In some interviews with women participants, the first name of the interviewee is omitted from source materials and therefore unknown.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The interviewees are members of SEIU Locals across the United States, and include nurses, nursing attendants, lab supervisors, researchers, therapists, food service workers, custodians, business agents, secretaries, and more. They discuss topics such as experiences of sexism and racism on the job, working conditions, union organizing, the women's movement, maternity leave, pay inequities, and workplace hierarchies. Some interviews include multiple interviewees, and are based on a particular topic such as the women's movement. Not all audio recordings have a transcript, and not all transcripts have an audio counterpart.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Healthcare workers first joined Service Employees International Union (SEIU) in 1941, when workers in San Francisco organized their hospital and won their first contract. Interview participants represented in this collection come from SEIU Locals across the United States.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Many of the interviews reference George Hardy's leadership as President from 1971-1980. During his tenure, the union saw rapid growth and organized its first local union of physicians. Merges and affiliations accounted for much of the growth during this time. There is also much discussion of the 1966 hospital workers strike in Los Angeles, which led to the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act, the first public employee law on collective bargaining in California.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to union organizing, history and structure, the interview participants discuss at length their thoughts on the women's rights movement and experiences of sexism and racism at work. Major themes include paid maternity leave, discrimination faced by pregnant women, pay inequity, and workplace sexual harrassment. The participants also discuss their relationship with the Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW), a national organization that formed in 1974 to advocate for women's issues within the labor movement. </field>
