William D. Haywood, et al.  Notable items include correspondence from William D. "Big Bill" Haywood written while incarcerated in Leavenworth, Kansas, and as a fugitive in the Soviet Union; an original sketch made by Haywood in the courtroom; and Karsner's dispatch to The New York Call describing the emotional courtroom meeting of Haywood and Eugene V. Debs.  Correspondents include Roger N. Baldwin of the National Civil Liberties Bureau and A.S. Embree and K.B. McDonald of the General Defense Committee of the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.).

The two separated photographs are of George V. Vanderveer, General Counsel for the I.W.W., and Frank K. Nebeker, Chief Prosecutor.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">David Fulton Karsner (1889-1941), socialist activist, author and newspaperman, was born in Baltimore, Maryland.  Educated at the McDonough School in Baltimore, Karsner began his journalistic career in Chicago by 1907.  There he developed an interest in socialism through his association with Upton Sinclair, and became acquainted with Clarence Darrow, Carl Sandburg, Jack London and other notable leftists.  In 1911 Karsner relocated East and worked for a number of newspapers, including the New York Tribune, thePhiladelphia Ledger and theNew York Daily News. He served as Sunday editor and then managing editor of the Socialist Party's newspaper,The New York Call.  In 1918, the Call assigned Karsner to cover the trial, United States of America v. William D. Haywood, et al., in which 166 members of the Industrial Workers of the World were charged and convicted of impeding the war effort under the 1917 Espionage Act.  The case was tried in the District Court of the United States, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division in Chicago.</field>
