    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Socialistic Labor Party, originally organized as the Workingmen's Party in 1876, was founded in 1877.  The name was changed to Socialist Labor Party (SLP) in 1890.  The official publisher of the Party was the New York Labor News Company, and many pamphlets from publisher exist in this collection as well as in the Tamiment cataloged books and pamphlets collections.  Two histories of the organization are included in the collection. The SLP was a marxist organization and still exists today.  In the late 1800s the Party attempted to affiliate with union and labor groups to create one large organization and then tried to move members away from the American Federation of Labor, which failed.  Those who were involved in this movement later were part of the founding of Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.).  Daniel DeLeon was a major figure in the party.  Pamphlets by and about him are part of the collection and can also be found in the Tamiment cataloged books and pamphlets collections.</field>
