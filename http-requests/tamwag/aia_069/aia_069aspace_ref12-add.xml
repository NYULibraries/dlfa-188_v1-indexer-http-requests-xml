    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series consists of an alphabetical run of subject files created and kept by Paul O'Dwyer. They document his broad areas of interest and activism, and are heavily weighted towards issues concerning conflict and human rights in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The series contains files on many of the organizations O'Dwyer was involved in that lobbied domestic government representatives for a more assertive American diplomatic presence in Ireland and Northern Ireland, including Americans for a New Irish Agenda, the Behon Law Society, the Irish American Unity Conference, and Irish-Americans for Clinton-Gore, amongst others. Prominent human rights, immigration, and extradition cases concerning Northern Ireland are also well-represented, including Joe Doherty, the Birmingham Six, and the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven. Friends and acquaintances present in these files were often allies in activism, and members of particular organizations often overlapped. This series also contains numerous files dating from O'Dwyer's work with the New York Commission for the United Nations and Consular Corps.</field>
