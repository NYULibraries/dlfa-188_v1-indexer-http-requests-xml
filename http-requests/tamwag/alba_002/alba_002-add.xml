This act, known as the McCarran Act after its author Senator Pat McCarran, did not outlaw the Communist Party but sought to secure its control through regulation. The Collection was assembled from various sources and contains transcripts of testimony of witnesses for the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) before the SACB from the 1950s to 1970s. It also contains a summary of the case by VALB member and attorney Benjamin Goldring, briefs, a trial transcript and correspondence between VALB and their attorneys, Leonard Boudin, Victor Rabinowitz and David Reinas well as correspondence and research about the SACB from Jaqueline Yost.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The United States Subversive Activities Control Board was created in 1950 in conjunction with enactment of the Internal Security Act of 1950. This act, known as the McCarran Act after its author Senator Pat McCarran, did not outlaw the Communist Party but sought to secure its control through regulation. It required registration with the United States government of domestic "communist-action organizations" (defined as organizations substantially under the control of "the world-wide communist movement") and of domestic "communist-front organizations" (defined as organizations substantially under the control of "communist-action organizations"). The Attorney General might petition the Subversive Activities Control Board to order the registration of specific organizations under one or the other of these rubrics. The Board, made up of five members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, was in turn empowered to hold hearings to determine whether these were indeed "communist-action" or "communist-front" organizations, and if so, to order them to register as such. Registration entailed annual provision of financial records and membership lists.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">Portions of the collection were donated by Benjamin Goldring and other portions, particularly the correspondence related to Jaqueline Yost, were donated by Jacqueline Yost. Another portion of the collection was pulled out of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Records (ALBA 019).</field>
