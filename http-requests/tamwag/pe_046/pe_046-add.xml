    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Socialist International is the worldwide organization of social democratic, socialist, and labour parties. Its origins go back to the early international organizations of the labour movement, and has existed in its present form since 1951, when it was re-established at the Frankfurt Congress. Since then it has been increasingly active and grown considerably in membership, more than doubling the number of its members in recent years. Labour, social democratic, and socialist parties are now a major political force in democracies around the world, with numerous member parties of the Socialist International leading governments or representing the main opposition force.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Materials in this collection have been compiled by the Tamiment Library. There is no accession record associated with this collection.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The provenance of the materials is varied. Items were obtained through purchases, donations, standing orders with publishers, arrangements with labor unions and other organizations, exchanges with other libraries, and through ongoing collecting by Tamiment staff. A majority of this collection was separated from the Democratic Socialists of America Collection (TAM 105).</field>
