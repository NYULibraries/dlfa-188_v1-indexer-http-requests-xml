    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series VII contains materials related to Kinderland activities, events, and programs conducted outside of the summer season. In the first part are the records of some of the Camp's many reunions, which often served as fundraisers to benefit the Camp. In these files are the records of three large reunions, held on Kinderland's 56th, 60th, and 75th anniversaries. Also in this series are the records of Kinderland cultural and recreational events; dances, protests and demonstrations, film screenings, and Passover seders among them. In addition, there are the records of benefit concerts, retirement celebrations, a trip to Cuba, and memorials organized by and for the Camp during the off-season months. Also included are various original and laser copies of posters and other graphic materials related to the camp's 75th anniversary and other events in the camp's history, possibly used for the anniversary exhibit.</field>
