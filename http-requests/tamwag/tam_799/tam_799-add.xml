    <field name="abstract_teim">The Student Liberation Action Movement (SLAM!) was a citywide radical student activist group, based at Hunter College (City University of New York) and formed in 1996 out of the dissolution of the CUNY Coalition in 1995. SLAM!'s main organizing concern was to stop the budget cuts and tuition increases at CUNY. The group also organized around welfare, Ethnic Studies, police on campus, incarceration, war, and other social justice movements. This collection consists of oral history interviews in electronic format with SLAM! activists conducted between 2012-2014 by Dr. Amaka Okechukwu, an interdisciplinary scholar, author, oral historian, and Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at George Mason University, as a part of Dr. Okechukwu's dissertation research which she completed in the Department of Sociology at NYU. The collection comprises 15 interviews with SLAM! members and collaborators, consisting of audio recordings in mp3 format and transcripts. As a part of her research process, Dr. Okechukwu's oral history work on this project was additionally reviewed and approved by NYU's Institutional Review Board (IRB). At least one interview, that of Suzy Subways, has been corrected. Topically, the interviews cover subjects such as the fight to save open admissions at CUNY; the origins, life-course, and decline of SLAM; young people of color organizations in New York City in the 1990s and 2000s; radical organizing on the Left in New York City in the 1990s and 2000s; and the individual biographies of each activist. Narrators in this collection include Kazembe Balagun, Jesse Ehrensaft-Hawley, Kamau Franklin, Camillo Gaston-Greenberg, Orlando Green, Neha Guatam, Chris Gunderson, Sabrine Hammad, Rachel LaForest, Mariano Munoz, Lenina Nadal, Irene Neofotistos, Brad Sigal, suzy subways, and Hank Williams.</field>
