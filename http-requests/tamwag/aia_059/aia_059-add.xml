    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection contains photographs, memoranda, correspondence, event programs, newspaper clippings, and financial records documenting Margaret Callaghan's involvement with the County Armagh Men's P&amp;B (Patriotic and Benevolent) Association and the Ladies Auxiliary of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, as well as the associations' history more broadly. The majority of materials include programs and souvenir journals from the society's annual ball and dinner dances ranging from the late 1920s to the early 2000s. Other materials document the associations' cultural, social, and political activities, including bus outings and sporting clubs. The collection also contains a series of subject files with content related to the New York Irish American community and political events in Northern Ireland (especially Armagh), including folders on Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich. The collection illustrates how social organizations, such as the Armagh Men's P&amp;B Association and the Ladies Ancient Order of Hibernians, created and maintained cultural communities in the United States while also retaining a connection to an ancestral homeland.</field>
