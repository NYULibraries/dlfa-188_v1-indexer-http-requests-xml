    <field name="abstract_teim">Vera Rony was an educator; writer; and labor, union, and civil rights advocate. In 1952, she began her career at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) and went on to become the executive director of the Workers Defense League (WDL). Additionally, Rony participated in the civil rights movement in the South, publishing a number of articles on the relationships between unions and civil rights. Rony served as the Founding Director and first Affirmative Action Officer of the Labor Management Studies Program at Stony Brook University. She was the Executive Producer of The Uprising of '34, a 1995 PBS documentary that explores the 1934 General Textile Strike in which 500,000 Southern mill laborers walked off their jobs. The bulk of the Vera Rony Papers relate to her work with different labor organizations, the making of the film, and her writing, all of which are closely related because of her focus on the history of labor movements in the South. Materials include correspondence, research material for her writing and the film, drafts and notes for published and unpublished writing, videotapes of the film, and audiocassettes of interviews used in the film.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Vera Rony Papers (1865-2009) consist of materials created and collected by Rony documenting her life as, in her own words, a "participant observer," or someone who alternates between the worlds of academia and grassroots fieldwork. The bulk of the collection relates to her work with different labor organizations, the making of the film, and her writing, all of which are closely related because of her focus on the history of labor movements in the South. She spent many years researching and writing on the topic, beginning in the 1960s, which seemed to culminate in the film and a never-published book, "True South." The collection contains news clippings, publications, printed ephemera, correspondence, and research files related to Rony's work at Stony Brook, the Workers Defense League (WDL), National Sharecroppers Fund (NSF), and other groups; Rony's published and unpublished writings; research, publicity, and administrative files for The Uprising of '34; VHS tapes and audiocassettes of interviews, mostly related to the film; and personal correspondence and photographs. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection documents the history of labor, unions, and civil rights movements in the United States, particularly in the South, in the 1950s-1970s. The collection is especially relevant to researchers interested in the activities of organizations such as the WDL and NSF, the agricultural and textile industries, racism, poverty, and the development and curricula of labor management studies programs.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Vera Rony (1918-2011) was an educator; writer; and labor, union, and civil rights advocate. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rony was born in Hungary in 1918. After coming to America in the 1920s, her father, Hugo Rony, became a medical doctor and her mother, Pauline (also known as Palko), took care of the household. Rony received her bachelor's degree from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1940, and her master's degree from the University of Chicago in 1969.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1952, she began her career at the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU), where she founded the education department of the Beltmakers Union and instituted night classes, a library, and a political action program. From 1956-1964, she was the executive director of the Workers Defense League (WDL), a workers' rights organization founded in 1936; her accomplishments included the organization of a training program to prepare minority youth to enter the building trades and a co-written report on how racism was used in the South to thwart union organizing efforts. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Additionally, from 1965-1969, Rony participated in the civil rights movement in the South, publishing a number of articles on the relationships between unions and civil rights. Also around this time, she worked with various organizations, including the Congress of Racial Equity (CORE), Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC), the Middle Tennessee Labor Conference, and the Southern Tenants Farmer Union (STFU). She most likely did not hold paid positions with these organizations, but worked as a volunteer consultant, committee member, and/or editor/contributor for publications. At the Rural Advancement Fund (part of the National Sharecroppers Fund/NSF), she chaired the Education Committee for the Frank P. Graham Rural Training Center in Wadesboro, North Carolina.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rony began her career at SUNY Stony Brook in 1969, as the first assistant vice president of the affirmative action program. By 1978, she had founded the Labor Management Studies Program, where she served as the director until 1987. Rony also held a visiting scholar position at Georgia State University, from 1976-1978. She was the Executive Producer of The Uprising of '34, a 1995 PBS documentary that explores the 1934 General Textile Strike in which 500,000 Southern mill laborers walked off their jobs. In 1995, the documentary won the Oral History Association Award for Nonprint Media for George Stoney and Judith Helfand, co-directors and co-producers, and Vera Rony, executive producer. Rony died on June 2, 2011, after a brief struggle with lymphoma. </field>
