    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series focuses on Rony's work with various labor organizations and her career at Stony Brook University. Her work with WDL, NSF, and STFU, among others, reflects her expertise in the Southern labor movement and labor history in general. Her interest in civil rights, especially those related to labor and unions, is reflected in the materials from the SSOC, where she possibly worked as a seminar speaker, and the correspondence files, in which she corresponded with the various publishers about the series of articles that she wrote in the mid-late 1960s. Her success in creating an academic program of study on labor is reflected in her career at SUNY Stony Brook, where she instituted the affirmative action program, founded the Center for Labor/Management Studies, and taught. Materials in this series include correspondence; meeting minutes and agendas; memos; publications (newsletters, press releases, and reports) from the organizations; reappointment materials for her position at Stony Brook; a report on the Labor/Management Studies program; and syllabi and lecture notes for Stony Brook and Georgia State University. In addition, there is a file on Rony's conference and event talks and speeches, which includes an audio recording of her participation in "Women, Work, and Dollars," in 1980.</field>
