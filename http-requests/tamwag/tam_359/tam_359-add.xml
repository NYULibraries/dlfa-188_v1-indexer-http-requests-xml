There is also a printout of a picture of Epstein and her husband, Leonard Jacobson, picketing at the New York City Welfare Department, as well as black-and-white photographs of the American Jewish Labor Council and (possibly) other various unidentified groups and individuals.
 
Additionally, the collection contains two issues of Jewish Currents; several programs from the Bronx Council of Emma Lazarus Clubs' Annual Donor's Luncheons; two insurance documents related to the liquidation of the International Workers Order, Inc.; an International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union apron; and a guide to organizing called Manual of Practical Political Action (produced by the National Citizens Political Action Committee). There is also an American Labor Party scrapbook of articles, correspondence, and programs related to its Annual Labor Bazaar and financial records from the bazaar. Approximately 30 political buttons on a variety of issues from the 1960s to the 2000s and assorted labor and political pamphlets, flyers, tickets, membership cards, and other printed ephemera are also present. To a lesser extent, there are materials related to Dorothy Epstein's mother, Sophie Epstein. These materials include a book, a course reader, and a photograph of James W. Ford inscribed to Sophie Epstein, as well as certificates she was awarded from Jewish and/or workers' rights organizations.</field>
