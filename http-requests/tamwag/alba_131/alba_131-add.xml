    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Frances Patai Papers consist predominantly of research materials she gathered and the drafts she produced during the course of her work on her unpublished book, Heroines of the Good Fight: U.S. Women Volunteers in the Spanish Civil War including articles, clippings, and notes. The collection is arranged in three series.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: biographical files of nurses and other women personnel who served during the Spanish Civil War. These contain recollections and firsthand accounts of the wartime medical facilities and the conditions in Spain during the conflict.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: published and unpublished materials by Patai, including drafts of her book, articles about the women in the International Brigades, conference papers and proposals, and miscellaneous writings on pornography and sexual abuse.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III: This series is made up of subject files. Included here are notes, excerpt from publications, and research materials on general topics, organizations, and individuals as well as biographical material on Patai. Notable among these files are copies of Jirku Gusti's, "We Fight Death," and Sandor Voros' unpublished manuscript on hospitals and medical services.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Frances Patai was born in New York City's Lower East Side in 1930. As a teenager, Patai performed in Jewish resorts in the Catskills as an actress and dancer. In her twenties she attended classes at City College of New York earning her bachelor's degree in 1955 and her MA in 1957. Beginning in the 1970s she served as an English and communications instructor at various institutions in the City University of New York (CUNY) system including long-term appointments at John Jay and the Borough of Manhattan Community Colleges.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Throughout her career Patai was concerned with the rights and status of women, addressing in a series of essays and articles issues related to rape, pornography, and abuse. During the 1980s she worked with the feminist organization Woman Against Pornography, serving as spokesperson and organizing their annual WAP Awards, an event that promoted the non-sexist representation of women in advertising. In later life Patai turned her attention to the anti-fascist movements of the 1930s, and began to investigate the history of American volunteers who joined the Republican forces to fight against Franco's army during the Spanish Civil War. Patai focused her attention on the participation of American women volunteers in the Spanish Civil War devoting her efforts to researching and writing a book on the contributions of nurses. Through her friendship with Fredericka Martin - a nurse with the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy who accrued extensive biographical material on her former colleagues - Patai gained access to unique primary materials. Patai died in 1998 before she could bring her project to fruition. She was 67 years old. Shortly before her death, Patai established an endowment to the City College Center for Worker Education to fund annual courses and lectures on the Nazi Holocaust.</field>
