    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains material accumulated by Harry during his service in World War II and his career as a labor organizer and instructor. His early files date from the mid-1940s, and document his time serving in the Army Service Forces at Camp Lee. These files include camp fact sheets, orientation newsletters, training manuals, and bulletins. Harry also wrote articles and presentations related to labor unions and organizing in the late 1950s-early 1960s including an analysis of the Playtex organizing drive and a radio script of a panel discussion he hosted for Wise Potato Chips. A large portion of this series is union organizing-focused fliers, bulletins, and handouts from the 1960s and early 1970s that were distributed by Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America. Some of this print material focused on specific organizing committees for companies including Heinz, Playtex, and Ore-Ida. A plaque for his 1973 retirement and cufflinks and tie clip from Amalgamated are also in this series. Harry also taught instructional courses in the 1980s at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies, and this series contains course manuals for topics including white collar organizing, collective bargaining, and advanced organizing techniques.</field>
