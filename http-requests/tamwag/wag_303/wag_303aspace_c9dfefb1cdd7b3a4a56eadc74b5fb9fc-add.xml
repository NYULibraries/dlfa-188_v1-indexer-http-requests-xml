    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains material related to the work and activism of Mae Kaplan Millstone. Early files include a small amount of school papers from the 1920s and 1930s. Reports, charts, and notes in this series document her work in the mid-1930s as an investigator for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Bureau of Women and Children regarding work environments and compliance. Mae's engagement calendars include daily entries of her life and work dating from 1959 to 2005. This series also includes Russian and Chinese language class papers, exercises, and audio recordings. Mae's scrapbook in this series contains women's sections of the York, Pennsylvania The Gazette and Daily from 1962, which was early in her tenure as editor. The subject files in this series were accumulated by Mae during the 1970s, either for use as part of her editing work or as personal reference files. These files reflect issues Mae perceived as affecting and impacting women, including affirmative action, contraception, the Equal Rights Amendement (ERA), feminism, health, religion, sports, and gender descrimination in the workplace. Her files include material on issues that not only affected her directly, but also affected women of color, and women living and working in countries outside the United States including China, Central America, South America, and Japan. These files typically contain press clippings, booklets, and brochures, and include a 1971 copy of Our Bodies, Ourselves. Mae's involvement in the national and York Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) is illustrated through her collection of organizational publications, photographs, event notices, and print material dating from the 1970s to 1980s. An event program and planning notes for a 1998 banquet in her honor hosted by the York Chapter of NOW is also in this series. Other honors and awards include a 1947 War Service Award for her work serving on the U.S. Office of Price Administration Labor Advisory Committee; and a parade program for her role as Grand Marshall for the 2005 York Labor Day Parade. Of particular note in this series is a digital recording of a 6.5 hour long 2005 video interview conducted by her son, David Millstone, in which Mae reflects on her personal life, work, and life-long activism in support of women's issues, world peace, and the labor movement.</field>
