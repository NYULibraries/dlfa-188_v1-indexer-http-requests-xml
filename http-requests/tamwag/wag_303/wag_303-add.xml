    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mae Kaplan Millstone (1913-2009) graduated with a Master's degree in Sociology from Pennsylvania State University in 1934, and worked during the mid-1930s for the National Industrial Recovery Administration as a Special Investigator through the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. She moved to Detroit in 1936 where she met Harry Millstone (1907-1999), who was a unionizer for the CIO at the time. They married in 1938. In 1941 they moved to Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Mae left the workforce to raise their two children, but continued to volunteer in consumer and voter registration activities. The family moved to York, Pennsylvania in 1961, where Mae became the editor of the women's section for The Gazette and Daily newspaper. She also stayed active in her community by co-founding the group York Action for Peace, and continued her support of the labor movement. She was also active in the York Chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) and volunteered for Planned Parenthood. Harry was employed by Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America for many years as a union organizer and retired in 1973. He continued to educate others, teaching various courses on union organizing at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies during the 1980s. In 1999 he received the Pillar of Labor from the Tamiment Library and Wagner Labor Archives.</field>
