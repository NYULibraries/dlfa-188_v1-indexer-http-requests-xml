    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These visual materials and artifacts (arranged alphabetically by folder title) mostly relate to John Pittman's friends, family, professional work and travels.  Most of the materials in it are photographs (mainly black and white), unless otherwise indicated.  Among the photographic portraits of Pittman and his relatives and friends are a late nineteenth/early twentieth century group photograph that includes his mother, Carrie Badger Pittman, and an early twentieth-century portrait of a man with a close resemblance to Pittman, who may be Pittman's father.  Images shot in the Soviet Union (including Pittman at Red Square in front of Lenin's tomb with other dignitaries, and commercial photographs of various tourist spots in Moscow at night, such as the Kremlin lit by floodlights) and in Prague were probably shot at the same time as John and Margrit Pittman's stint as Moscow correspondents for the People's World and John Pittman's time on the editorial board of World Marxist Review.  On the other hand, the small number of images from Mexico (shot by People's World photographer Elmer Allen) do not seem to have come from any journey that Pittman himself  took; similarly there are a handful of photographic images of various persons with whom (with the likely exception of Angela Davis) Pittman was not personally acquainted, ranging from Lyndon Baines Johnson to an image of Le Quang Vinh  (leader of the independent Hòa Hảo army of Vietnam that fought against the Viet Minh and who was imprisoned and executed by the government of South Vietnam).  Graphics and realia include a small print of a New Masses logo, and plates and mat molds for the title and accompanying photograph of Pittman for his weekly column in the People's World, "The World This Week."</field>
