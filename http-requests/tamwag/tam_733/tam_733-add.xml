    <field name="abstract_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Native American Serials groups 54 titles relating to Native American culture originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, and mailings distributed by Native American tribes, committees, councils, schools, and community groups in the United States between 1969-2003. The publications document news and events, addressing education, human and civil rights issues, and environmental concerns, including land and water rights. Serials are in some cases entirely dedicated to, or otherwise contain substantial coverage of, the legal justice campaign in support of imprisoned activist Leonard Peltier. Titles often contain detailed accounts of meetings and community events, and are often rich with reproductions of photographs, illustrations, and poems. A small portion of the collection originates from outside the United States, collecting titles from Vancouver, Yellowknife, and Chase, in Canada; from Brussels, Belgium; and from Salta, Argentina.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives Collection of Native American Serials groups 54 titles relating to Native American culture originally received by the Tamiment Library through subscriptions, donations, and as part of archival collections. The majority of the collection consists of incomplete runs of newspapers, newsletters, and mailings distributed by Native American tribes, councils, schools, community groups, legal organizations, and solidarity committees in the United States between 1969-2003. The publications provide contemporaneous coverage of news and events in local Native American communities, featuring reports on human
and civil rights issues; education; and environmental concerns, including land and water rights, documenting disputes and changes
in the laws governing farming and fishing. A significant portion of the collection is made up of publications specifically dedicated to or containing substantial coverage of the justice campaign supporting the exoneration of activist Leonard Peltier; these titles are mainly variations on Crazy Horse Spirit published by regional chapters of the Leonard Peltier Defense Committee, including Crazy Horse Spirit Newsletter, Crazy Horse News, Free the People, and various Peltier Update Reports. Other justice campaigns are also detailed, including legal efforts around Yvonne Wanrow, Dennis Banks, Paul Skyhorse, Richard Mohawk, and others. Additional holdings include issues of Council Fires, Indian Nation, Survival News, and several years of Wassaja. Serials in this collection contain detailed accounts of meetings and community events, and are often well-illustrated, reproducing photographs, artworks, and poems throughout. A small portion of the collection originates from outside the United States, collecting several titles from Vancouver, Yellowknife, and Chase, in Canada; from Brussels, Belgium; and from Salta, Argentina. No complete runs of publications are contained herein, and generally only a handful of issues of each publication are held.</field>
