    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1936, John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, named Philip Murray chairman of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC). The Committee was charged with leading an organizing drive of the entire steel industry. Out of the SWOC, the United Steelworkers of America was formed, holding its founding convention in 1942. Murray was elected as the first president and served until his death in 1952. Since its founding, various unions have merged with the United Steelworkers, most recently, in 2005, the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers (PACE) International Union. This merger created the largest industrial union in North America, a union not only of steelworkers but also workers in industries such as manufacturing, health care, pharmaceuticals, mining, energy and utilities. As of 2009, the United Steelworkers of American had over 850,000 active members in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean.</field>
