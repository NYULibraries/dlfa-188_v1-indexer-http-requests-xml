    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Area Postal Union represents over 21,000 postal clerks, motor vehicle operators, maintenance, and mail handlers in New York and New Jersey.  The local resulted from the 1958 secession of officers and members of Local 10, National Federation of Post Office Clerks, an organization dating back to 1901.  The secessionists favored an industrial organization that would include all postal crafts.</field>
