    <field name="abstract_teim">William Golden was an optometrist and amateur photographer. He was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Camp Wo-Chi-Ca (which stood for Workers Children's Camp), a children's summer camp in New Jersey. The camp, which was founded in 1934 and ran through the early 1950s, was mainly organized by the International Workers Order (I.W.O.) and was affiliated with the Communist Party, USA. The collection consists of approximately 300 negatives, nine mounted prints and a few smaller photographs, and photocopies of three promotional pamphlets or flyers. Photographic materials in the collection depict scenes of Camp Wo-Chi-Ca and camp life in the 1940s and early 1950s.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of approximately 300 negatives, nine mounted prints and a few smaller photographs, and photocopies of three promotional pamphlets or flyers. Photographic materials in the collection depict scenes of Camp Wo-Chi-Ca and camp life in the 1940s and early 1950s. The negatives appear to be mostly from a few days in August of one year. A few negatives are from visits to Hyde Park. Some negatives and photographs are housed in annotated paper sleeves or envelopes; the annotations may provide descriptions of individuals, places, or events in the images. There are also two promotional flyers or pamphlets for the camp and an advertisement for "Paul Robeson Day."</field>

He was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Camp Wo-Chi-Ca (which stood for Workers Children's Camp), a children's summer camp in New Jersey. The camp, which was founded in 1934 and ran through the early 1950s, was mainly organized by the International Workers Order (I.W.O.) and was affiliated with the Communist Party, USA. The camp was coeducational and racially diverse. Campers lived together in huts or tents, helped with camp chores, and participated in sports, concerts, plays, and political discussions. Camp Wo-Chia-Ca also received well-known visitors like Paul Robeson, Howard Fast, and Aaron Krammer.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Donated by Ruth Vogel, Arthur Vogel's wife, circa 1993. The accession numbers associated with this gift are 1950.188 and NPA.1993.012.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">William Golden's photographs were given to Arthur Vogel when Vogel was serving as program director for the Metropolitan Fraternal Club, a Jewish secular progressive club. The photographs were entrusted to Vogel by Club members older than Vogel who had been involved with Camp Wo-Chi-Ca. Arthur Vogel's wife, Ruth Vogel, then donated the photographs to the Tamiment Library, possibly around 1993. The accession numbers associated with this collection are 1950.188 and NPA.1993.012.</field>
