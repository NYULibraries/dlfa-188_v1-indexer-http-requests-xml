    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Union Square Awards was established in 1998 to provide support for grassroots activism throughout the five boroughs of New York City. 187 organizations have received the Union Square Award, which provides a general assistance grant of $50,000 to an emerging organization as well as technical assistance and the opportunity to apply for regrants. In 2006 the Union Square Arts Award was established to recognize organizations that provide educational opportunities in the arts to low-income communities. This award consists of a $35,000 grant, technical assistance and regrant opportunities. Beginning in 2004, the Union Square Awards has provided over 300 individual grants of $25,000 to eligible organizations that had received a Union Square Award in the past and required further assistance to meet their goals. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 2012 the Union Square Fund Board announced that it will no longer be issuing new grants to applicants. The Union Square Fund will be scaling down all activities by December 2014 and will continue to provide technical assistance and support to active grantees throughout that period. </field>
