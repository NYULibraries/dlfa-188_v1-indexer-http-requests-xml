    <field name="abstract_teim">Ann and her late husband John Garvey were educators and active members of the New York City Irish American community. The couple were also past presidents and founding members of the American Irish Teachers Association (AITA). The Garveys focused much of their organizing on educational initiatives to increase and improve the teaching of Irish and Irish American culture and history. The John and Ann Garvey Papers document the Garveys' teaching through organizational newsletters (the majority of which are from the AITA), conference programs, as well as agendas, meeting notes, and correspondence from various committee meetings. The collection also documents the Garveys engagement with Irish American organizations through photographs, newspaper articles, and programs for conventions and other annual events. Organizations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the United Irish Counties Association of New York, and various County Mayo-centered social organizations (especially the Mayo Society of New York) are particularly well represented.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The John and Ann Garvey Papers, dated approximately 1935-2020, consist of materials documenting the couple's work as educators and their engagement with numerous Irish American organizations in the Greater New York City area. Materials documenting the Garveys teaching include organizational newsletters (the majority of which are from the American Irish Teachers Association), conference programs, as well as agendas, meeting notes, and correspondence from various committee meetings. These materials focus almost exclusively on organizations and education initiatives devoted to increasing and improving the teaching of Irish and Irish American culture and history, such as a proposed curriculum on the Irish Famine/Great Hunger. The collection also documents the Garveys engagement with Irish American organizations through photographs, newspaper articles, and programs for conventions and other annual events. Organizations like the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the United Irish Counties Association of New York, and various County Mayo-centered social organizations (especially the Mayo Society of New York) are particularly well represented.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">John J. Garvey (d. 2018) was an Irish American educator who held numerous leadership positions in the Irish American community. Garvey worked the bulk of his professional career in the New York City public school system with over three decades at P.S. 85. He focused much of his attention on educational outreach programs for new immigrants, as well as improving the treatment of Irish and Irish American history in curriculum. A native of County Mayo, Garvey studied at St. Muredach's College in Ballina (County Mayo) and Patrician College in Ballyfin (County Laois). He later earned a B.A. from Fordham University in Marketing and Management and a M.A. in Distributive Education from New York University.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Garvey was a president and founding member of the Irish American Teachers Association, a historian and president of the Mayo Society of New York, a member of the Board of Directors for the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, and a chair of the Irish American Heritage and Culture Committee (New York City Board of Education). He was also an essay judge for the St. Patrick's Day Parade Committee essay competition, a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (Division 4), and a member of the Bronx Gaelic League.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ann Garvey is an Irish American educator who has held numerous leadership positions in the Irish American community. She has held positions as a lecturer at New York University's Graduate School of Education and as an Educational Evaluator with the New York City Board of Education. Garvey is the past president of the American Irish Teachers Association (AITA), during which time she led the organization's campaign to include curriculum on Ireland's Great Hunger (commonly referred to as Ireland's Famine) in New York State's Human Rights Curriculum law, which mandated the study of this historical moment throughout the state. Alongside her husband John, Ann organized campaigns for the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp for the Great Hunger. In 1998, Ann was named Irish Woman of the Year by the Irish American Heritage and Culture Committee (New York City Board of Education) for her contributions.</field>
