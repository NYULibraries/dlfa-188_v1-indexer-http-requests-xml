    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Service Employees International Union Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR) is the largest housestaff union in the United States. It represents residents, interns and fellows in California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Washington, D.C. It was founded in 1957 as the Committee of Interns and Residents to represent interns and residents in New York City hospitals. In May 1997, the Committee of Interns and Residents affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. The website was first captured in 2010, but the website is not navigable but features news about healthcare reform and the National Labor Relations Board confirmation on the rights of residents to join a union. The first full capture of the website was in 2014. The website featured their history; information on the executive committee; structure and governance; annual reports; their publications dating back to 1970; benefits; the CIR contract; alumni networking and news; quality improvement resources; CIR's Policy and Education Initiative in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake; and press releases dating back to 2008. In 2017, the website was redesigned. In 2017, the website highlighted their 60th anniversary; convention highlights; benefits; and news. The website also has sections documenting their work related to raising standards re wages, benefits, and working conditions; resident well-being; women in medicine; patient care funds; health justice for all; and an obesity prevention program called the Family Health Challenge. In 2019, they expanded their issue focused work on immigration, the proposed public charge rule, racial justice, reproductive rights for women and families, and gun violence as a public health issue. The website has also focused on student debt forgiveness and the COVID-19 pandemic.</field>
