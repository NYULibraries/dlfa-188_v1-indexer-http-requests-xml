The event included speeches, meetings, tours of other cities in the Soviet Union, and tours of factories, schools, and hospitals. Upon her return to the United States, Williams and other WILPF members were interviewed by the FBI to describe their trip and their interactions with Russians. The Abbie Louise Bosworth Williams Collection on the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom consist of materials documenting Abbie Louise Bosworth Williams's 1963 trip to the Soviet Union with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).
