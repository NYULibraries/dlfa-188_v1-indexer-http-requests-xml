    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series includes materials from investigations into corruption in New York City's District Council of Carpenters dating back to District Council President Ted Maritas. This includes the indictment and related cases. Maritas disappeared and his body was never found. However, his wallet and car were found alongside the East River. The trail of corruption and records of litigation continue through the successive government cases against District Council President Paschal McGuinness, who resigned from his office and was barred from seeking union office in New York City (he held an executive position within the International Brotherhood of Carpenters), and Fred Devine (found guilty on racketeering charges; case on appeal). Materials include indictments, memoranda, correspondence, transcripts of hearings, and reports of the Independent Review Officer (I.R.O.) charged with oversight in the District Council. Other noteworthy documents in the series include the transcripts of the hearings on corruption at the Jacob Javits Center (Fiorino); the indictment and related records related to the shooting of Carpenters' official John O'Connor; and the repeated efforts of outspoken members to secure their rights within the union (Macaluso; Clarke; Local 608 hiring hall case). Additional examples of graft and corruption can be found in the records of (former) Bronx Local 17 (Shepis; Moscatiello).</field>
