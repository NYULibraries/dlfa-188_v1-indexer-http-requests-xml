    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview Popeye (Roland Llewellyn-Thomas) describes the transitions of counter-culture movement in the Lower East Side from the Beats and hippies and the Young Lords of the 1970s and solitary, curmudgeonly squatters to the more organized, whiter activists, and crusty punks squatting in the 1980s and 1990s. He also describes the life cycle of a squat, and life at C-Squat in the early days. He discusses gender and power dynamics at C-Squat. Popeye was the lead singer of the band Banji, and he discusses how squatting allowed him to stay in music even though it did not become a source of income for him. He describes the transition at C-Squat from a mixed group, with lots of Hungarians and other Europeans, to all young crusty punks, and how the group learned over time to work together as a collective. Finally, he talks about the legalization process and his experiences of becoming a homeowner.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Popeye (Roland Llewellyn-Thomas) was raised in Toronto by a British scientist father and an American mother. He had a privileged upbringing, but was not wealthy. He came to New York City in 1975, after seeing a photo in the paper of CBGBs.  He became a stripper in Times Square, and ended up experiencing the early days of punk rock, through the white downtown scene. He also experienced the early stages of hip hop, through the black and Puerto Rican scene he was involved with through hustling. He also worked as a bike messenger for fifteen years.  He started squatting in the late 1980s at 327-29 8th Street, which burned down. Later he lived in a shack on the roof of Fetus, which also burned down.</field>
