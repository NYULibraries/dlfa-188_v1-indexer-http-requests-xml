    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In this interview Gerald Wade, aka Jerry the Peddler describes the earliest roots of organized squatting on the Lower East Side. He describes the Yippie squatting actions of the late 1970s and the Pope of Pot, a squatter, drug dealer, and cult leader. He discusses the importance of food, beer, and pot as organizing tools. Wade also describes the development and defense of La Plaza Cultural, where in 1986 they fed up to 500 people a day; some of those people opened Serenity House. He discusses the mounting tensions over Tompkins Square Park in the late 1980s, the riots, and ongoing protests, with which he was centrally involved. He also talks about the 1988 fire at 319 8th Street, and subsequent eviction and demolition of the building. The first session of the interview ends suddenly with a discussion of the May Day and Pot Parade actions in 1990. In the second session, Wade discusses the Triad, Tia Scott, his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction in the 1990s, the defense of the ABC Community Center, the 13th Street eviction, the eviction of Dos Blocos, and anarchist/communist dynamics in anti-war activism during the Persian Gulf War. He discusses the archives at Tamiment, his own archives, and the importance of history. He talks about how he got sober. Wade talks about the pig roasts he used to organize for May Day. He also discusses the legalization process, his experiences of becoming a homeowner, and the potential for squatting today.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Gerald Wade, aka Jerry the Peddler, grew up in west Texas. He was raised by his father and grandparents, and left home at age 15, which he notes as common experience among people in the squats. At 17 he joined the army. Having been a teenager in the 1960s, he acquired an "us against them" attitude, and during his time in the army became involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and anti-war activism, even while living on a base in California. When he was supposed to go to Vietnam, Wade went AWOL and lived in the hills in Big Sur for a month. He spent time in Los Angeles and then moved to Fort Worth, Texas where he was involved with draft counseling and the White Panthers. After getting arrested for being AWOL several times he went to Washington, DC for the 1971 May Day protests, where he was detained in RFK Stadium with 20,000 other protesters. He stayed in DC and got involved with the Yippies, who he cites as an important influence on the squatting scene. Between 1974 and 1980 started a relationship, had begun working steadily, and withdrew from politics. After his relationship ended in 1980, however, Wade moved to New York where he once again became involved in political activism. In New York he became connected with people in The Triad, squatted buildings on 7th Street by Avenue D, organized by Everything for Everybody, and after spending some time living in Tompkins Square Park settled in a squatted building on 9th Street. Wade also helped to organize Rock Against Regan, a touring concert, and when the group returned to NYC in 1984, and Wade and others from the group opened the building at 319 East 8th Street. After that point a number of buildings opened up along 8th Street.</field>
