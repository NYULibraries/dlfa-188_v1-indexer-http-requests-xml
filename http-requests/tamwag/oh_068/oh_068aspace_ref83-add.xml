    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Tauno Biltsted describes the "chaotic and lovely" world of the Lower East Side in the 1980s, and how he got involved with squatting through the encampment at Tompkins Square Park. He moved into C-Squat in 1989, and describes the social and physical makeup of the building at that time, including drug use, decision-making, and the creation of the basement show space.  He discusses the ABC Community Center occupation, and the complicated relationships between Tent City and the squatters, and homesteaders and squatters. He also talks about his experience living in Umbrella House. He describes the politics, organization, and physical condition of Umbrella House over the next 20 years, including rebuilding the infrastructure of the space, issues around race, record-keeping, and allocation of spaces. He discusses eviction defense, including 13th Street, and the legalization process, beginning with meetings in the early 1990s that did not lead to an agreement on legalization. Biltsted was deeply and consistently involved in the legalization process, and he discusses debates over resale value and affordability and the challenges of dealing with ownership.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Tauno Biltsted was born in 1970 in Copenhagen, Denmark, to a Danish father and a Turkish/Canadian mother, and grew up in a hippie neighborhood in Vancouver. At age 13 his family returned to Copenhagen in search of work, and two years later they moved to East 3rd Street in New York. As a teenager he was into punk rock music and culture, and while in Copenhagen he was involved with the squatting scene there. In 1989 Biltsted moved into C-Squat in 1989 following the Tompkins Square riots. It was mostly young people, but not yet all punk rock, and included expatriate Hungarians. He was interested in taking over spaces and people running them as models for how to live in community. Biltsted later went to Europe to experience the squatting scene there in 1991-1992, and when he returned to New York he was voted into Umbrella House.</field>
