    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In his interview Rolando Politi discusses his role as a representative and the challenges of trying to work with the community. He also talks about the difficulties that arose as factions in the buildings began to disagree and argue. His interview contains a number of good stories about opening and working on buildings on 13th Street. Politi moved around several times because he never got very attached to a specific apartment or building. He also offers insight into the differences between European squatting and squatting in the United States.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Rolando Politi was born and raised in Naples, Italy and was involved with social work and housing throughout Europe, especially Germany, during the 1970s and 1980s. He came to New York in 1980 and moved between different squats. In April of 1984, Politi, along with several other people, took over 539 E. 13th Street. Politi was active in the East 13th Street Homestead Coalition and served as a representative at Community Board meetings.</field>
