    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Maggie Wrigley's interview describes the beauty and brutality of New York and the Lower East Side in the 1980s. Wrigley, who lived at Bullet Space, describes doing work days, being voted in at a meeting, and discusses how the squatter made decisions about allocating space over time. She describes the cold of those first winters, the violent atmosphere, doing work on the building, and the community of squatters and supporters. She also describes both tense and friendly relationships with their neighbors on the block. Wrigley talks about the 13th Street evictions, the defense of Umbrella House, and defending their building with barricades and petitions from the city and from non-profit housing groups. Wrigley discusses how squatters were demonized, and how they proved their good intentions by securing permanent affordable housing in the neighborhood. She also discusses her archives â€“ why she made them, what they contain, and how she has used them. Bullet Space has historically been an artists' building, and she discusses its evolution as such, and art projects done there over the years, including Steal This Radio and Your House is Mine. Wrigley talks about how the building was run, and how it has changed with legalization. She describes the health impacts of living in a squat. Finally, Wrigley discusses the legalization process, and the challenges of dealing with UHAB and becoming homeowners, including negotiations with Margarita Lopez.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Maggie Wrigley was born in Brisbane, Australia in 1958, and grew up in Sydney. Her father was a chemist and her mother was a teacher. After briefly attending art school she left Australia to go travelling, and stayed in San Francisco for a year, living in a punk rock warehouse and working in a punk rock club. She intended to only visit New York for a while in 1984, but felt instantly at home and decided to stay in the city where she worked in night clubs. In the winter of 1987 Wrigley started squatting at Bullet Space, after paying rent for a place in Williamsburg that had no heat or water.</field>
