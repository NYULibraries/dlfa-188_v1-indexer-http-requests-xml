    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Jessica Hall discusses the difficult process of getting a space in the building where she lived at 209 East 7th Street, everyday life in squats, and her run-in with Child Protective Services. As the secretary for the building she talks about decision-making processes and the shift over time from construction work to administrative work. She was deeply involved in the legalization process and talks about the negotiations with UHAB, and in particular the debates over debt and resale value. As a homemaker, Hall talks about the impact of that on her life choices and her decision to go back to school to become a social worker. Finally, she talks about what the gender dynamics and everyday life in the building have been like in recent years.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Jessica Hall grew up in rural Maine. She moved to New York City to study theater at New York University, fell in love and started a family. In 1995 Hall was an activist and stay at home mom, living on Avenue A and struggling to pay the rent, when her family decided to move into a squatted building at 209 East 7th Street. A few years after her family moved into the squat, she became the building's secretary. She was also a homemaker and later went back to school to pursue a career as a social worker.</field>
