    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection of approximately 2500 photographs (many are copy prints for the Union's publication, The Union Mail) documents the concerns of the New York Metro Area Postal Union's membership over a twenty-five year period (1955-1981). Images of rallies and demonstrations show the issues around which the union organized and the changing language for those demands. Of special interest are the shots of the union's delegation leaving for the 1963 March on Washington. In addition, the collection also includes photoprints of individuals, bargaining sessions, and national conventions. There are some images of union-sponsored social groups, such as the chess club and bowling team. The union's lobbying is reflected in images of local and national union leadership with various politicians including John F. Kennedy, Robert F. ("Bobby") Kennedy, Kenneth Keating, and Congressman John Lindsay. The collection also contains a significant number of negatives.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The original folder titles for the photographs as received from the union have largely been retained, but the information in them, and on the backs of many of the photographs as well,  is not always accurate.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The New York Metro Area Postal Union (American Postal Workers Union, Local 10) represents clerks, motor vehicle staff, maintenance workers and mail-handlers in the greater New York City area. (Some mail-handlers, however, are represented by other unions.) By the 1980s the union enrolled more than 25,000 members. The local originated as Local 10 of the National Federation of Post Office Clerks. Officers and most of the members of this local seceded in 1958 to become the Postal Union of Manhattan-Bronx Clerks (which in 1960 changed its name to the Manhattan-Bronx Postal Union), with the aim of uniting many postal craft workers into one industrial union. The union became part of the newly-created American Postal Workers Union in 1971, after taking a leading role in the hard-fought national strike of postal workers in 1970. Under the presidencies of Moe Biller and Josie MacMillan from the 1958 through the 1980s, the local union won significant gains for its members. Both the membership and the leadership became more diverse as post office jobs opened up to minorities and women as a result of civil rights initiatives in the 1960s. In 1973 the union changed its name to the New York Metro Area Postal Union, the new name reflecting the inclusion of the New York Bulk and Foreign Mail Center and the North Jersey Facility in the local's bargaining unit.</field>
