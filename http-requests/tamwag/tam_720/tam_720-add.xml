    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman Papers contain research materials and personal files related to the work of journalists and filmmakers Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman. Half of the collection documents Snitow and Kaufman's production company Snitow-Kaufman Productions, which includes research and promotional materials related to their films. Two boxes contain FBI files used as research for the documentary Between Two Worlds. The documentary focused on communist purges within the American Jewish Congress (AJC). These materials include Alan Snitow's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for FBI files on the AJC, the Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, the American Jewish Committee, and individual AJC members including Billie Portnow, Judith Pollack, Stanley Levison, Shad and Justine Polier. Alan Snitow also submitted FOIA requests for files on his parents Virginia Levitt Snitow and Charles Snitow, but those files are not included in the collection.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Other materials in the collection include diaries, interviews, and tape logs from a trip Snitow took to the Soviet Union in 1989.
