    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is mostly comprised of photocopies of materials related to Emma Goldman generated during Goldman's lifetime. These primary materials were collected and often annotated by Alice Wexler in the course of conducting her research and include news articles, correspondence written to or by Goldman, and flyers. Wexler's notes on sources she consulted and her transcriptions of primary materials also make up a large portion of the collection. The collection also includes correspondence to Alice Wexler from people who knew Emma Goldman (including members of Goldman's extended family, like Miriam Berman and Ian Ballantine), as well as from scholars who have also written about Emma Goldman, drafts of lectures by Wexler on Goldman, and about 150 photographs (mainly copy photographs of originals in other repositories) of Goldman taken throughout her life as well as photographs of her family and other well-known anarchists like her friend Alexander Berkman.  In addition, the collection contains a VHS tape labeled "Emma Goldman," two cassette tapes labeled "Ahrne Thorne" from 1982, and two microcassette tapes containing interviews with anarchist newspaper editor Ahrne Thorne, anarcho-syndaclists Sam and Esther Dolgoff, and others from 1983 and 1984, and two annotated books, The Tragedy of Spain by Rudolf Rocker (1986) and Emma Goldman: Anarquista de ambos mundos by Jose Peirats (1978).</field>
