    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Capture of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) website began in 2007 at http://www.ccr-ny.org/v2/home.asp. The website contained news, press releases, pamphlets, and fact sheets from the organization. It also includes education and outreach information on police brutality, alternatives to incarceration, prison phone contract monopolies, reparations, and the Movement Support Resource Center. Their legal programs in 2007 focused on international human rights, government misconduct, racial and economic justice, September 11, Cuba travel ban, corporate accountability, and Guantánamo Bay. In 2008, the organization's URL changed to http://www.ccrjustice.org/. The website then included a legal glossary, their newsletter and press releases, press about CCR, and their legal docket on issues such as illegal dentention and Guantánamo, surveillance and attacks on dissent, criminal justice and mass incarceration, corporate human rights abuse, government abuse of power, racial, gender, and economic justice, and international law and accountability. In 2015, the website went through another redeisgn and expanded their case load to cases related to abusive immigration practices, corporate human rights abuses, criminalizing disset, discrimatory policiting, drone killings, government surveillance, Guantánamo Bay, LGBTQIA+ persecution, mass incarceration, Muslim profiling, Palestinian solidarity, racial injustice, sexual and gender-based violence, and torture, war crimes, and militarism. The website at the time also highlights the Bertha Justice Institute, an arm of CCR to support early career lawyers and legal workers. In 2015, they also launched their blog, the Daily Outrage. In 2018, CCR launched the Activist Files, a podcast that features stories of activists, lawyers, and artists fighting for justice. The website also shifted to highlighting more ways to get involved with CCR, through internships, fellowships, volunteering, job opportunities, events, fact sheets, reports, client profiles, testimony, and advocacy videos.</field>
