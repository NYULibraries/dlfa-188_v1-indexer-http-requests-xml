    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of Series II: Correspondence consists of personal correspondence between Fielding and less famous colleagues, readers, researchers, and friends. In his later years, these provide summaries of his career that are more personal than his autobiography, including letters that describe Fielding's struggle with emphysema and arthritis and his wife's affliction with cerebral artereo-sclerosis. Fielding also had personal correspondence with well-known individuals like Upton Sinclair (1918-1928), John Haynes Holmes (1938), Ralph Bunche (1955) and J. W. Fulbright (1965). Scattered throughout is printed ephemera relating to sexology, psychology, and other matters.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also documents Fielding's participation in the American Social Hygiene Association, The American Birth Control League, the Eugenics Educational Society, the Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress, the Ethical Humanist Societies of Greater New York, the Freethinkers of America, and the Thomas Paine Foundation through correspondence with officials and members of these organizations. Among Fielding's correspondents in the Birth Control, Sexual Reform and Psychology movements between 1917 and 1972 were Drs. William J. Robinson, Harry Benjamin, Victor Robinson, Samuel Schmalhausen, and Andre Tridon. Other correspondents include Marie C. Stopes, Margaret Sanger, and Havelock Ellis. His relationship with Emanuel Haldmann-Julius, owner and editor of the Little Blue Books, is evident in correspondence with Haldmann-Julius, his family, and his biographers (1919-1973). Issues of free thought and rationalism are discussed in correspondence with Joseph Lewis (1923-1968), Alfred Korzybski (on general semantics and mathematical reasoning, 1921-1933), Martin J. Martin (1966-1971), and Madalyn Murray O'Hair (1969-1971). </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Fielding's expertise in Tiffany artworks and the history of the Tiffany firm generated considerable correspondence with collectors and other parties interested in the authenticity of pieces and his own collection. Fielding's employment at Tiffany's also placed him in the position of ex-officio income tax consultant for the company's executives and for Emelia Tiffany. Letters from John D. Rockefeller (1922), Helen Keller (1928), and Barry Goldwater (1959) were acquired through his affiliation with Tiffany.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series also includes a small number of photographs, likely removed from Fielding's personal correspondence.</field>
