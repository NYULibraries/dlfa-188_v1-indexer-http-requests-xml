    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I, Correspondence.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series comprises Lending's incoming and outgoing correspondence primarily written in the late 1970s and the 1980s. All of Lending's correspondence reflects the deep impression the Spanish Civil War made on him. In letters with Victor Berch (archivist of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archive at Brandeis University) and Peter Carroll (while Carroll was researching his book Odyssey of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade), among others, Lending recounts tales of battles, revisits the intricate political controversies of the period, memorializes fallen comrades and analyzes the impact that the war had on his life and politics. Many of the letters reflect Lending's lifelong project to disabuse others, especially former Spanish Civil War comrades, of their allegiance to what he considered to be the hypocrisy and betrayal of Communism. Veterans with whom Lending corresponded include Moe Fishman, John Gerassi, Manny Harriman, Ben Iceland, Charles Nusser, Albert Prago, Abe Osheroff and George Watt. Other of Lending's correspondence focuses upon his efforts to gain public recognition for Jewish participation in the Spanish Civil War. Correspondence also includes exchanges with political philosopher Sidney Hook; with veteran David Miller, who conducted an extensive interview with Lending (see Series II for transcript); with Morris Schappes, editor of Jewish Currents; and with Irving Weissman. A file of Lending's letters to writer Ronald Radosh does not include Radosh's replies.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II, Subject Files.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series is comprised of documents primarily produced between the 1970s and 1990s. Exceptions include a hand-drawn "Wall-Paper" score chart from Spain rating the achievement of tasks by different Lincoln Brigade companies; a skit and poem, possibly written in conjunction with Robert Steck's cultural commission; a portion of a diary by an unidentified volunteer; and an Army Service Forces investigation of Lending's Communist activities conducted in 1944, during his service in World War II. A partial transcript of an interview with Lending conducted by veteran David Miller covers Lending's childhood, his political dawning in the 1930s, a period spent working at the socialist Camp Unity, and encounters with political orthodoxy in Spain that fed his growing disenchantment with the Communist Party. (The audiotapes associated with this transcript have been separated into the non-print collection; consult staff for access.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Evidence of Lending's criticism of VALB includes a negative analysis of a VALB-sponsored proposal to develop a high school curriculum on the history of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A cross-section of Lending's writings are represented here, including articles published in Jewish Currents, the Florida Sun-Sentinel, Horizonand the Volunteer; as well as numerous letters to editors. Other writings include a typescript about anti-aircraft battle that appears to be based in part upon a memoir written by comrade Jim Persoff (this memoir appears elsewhere in this series); and typescripts for public speaking engagements.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Isaac Edward Lending was born March 24, 1912 and raised in the Bronx. His father, who ran a textile trimmings business, was a religious Jew and early member of the Zionist Organization of America. As a young man, Lending switched the order of his first and middle names, and was known thereafter as Edward Isaac Lending.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lending studied journalism and business at City College of New York and New York University, but never completed his degree. In 1935 he joined the Communist Party and in 1937, at 27 years old, he departed for Spain aboard the Ile de France to join the International Brigades in fighting the Spanish Civil War. Over the next 21 months, Lending played a variety of roles in the war. He fought and was wounded in the Battle of Brunete. When he recovered, he was promoted to sergeant and fought in the Battles of Quinto and Belchite. In a break from fighting, Lending edited Brigade newspaper Our Fight and worked with volunteer Robert Steck in the Cultural Commission organizing a theatrical troop to entertain rearguard units. In December 1937, Lending volunteered for anti-aircraft service, joining the German Dimitrov Battery in the air defense of Barcelona.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After returning to the U.S. in December 1938, Lending became a member of the Executive Board of the Veterans of the Abraham Brigade (VALB). In 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in World War II, putting his anti-aircraft experience to use in Belgium and Holland. During Lending's service an Army Service Forces investigation reported on his political activities. The report concluded that Lending was to be barred from attending Officer Candidate School as well as from performing a host of security-related duties. He was, however, granted an honorable discharge in 1946.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lending pursued his political goals through journalism and public speaking, meanwhile making his living in sales and advertising in New York City. He married Jean Strunsky in 1949 and lived in Mexico City between 1950 and 1952. In 1960 he married Florence Davis. Their only child together died of Tay-Sachs Disease at age three.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">While Lending had been devoted to the Communist Party between 1935 and 1943, his disillusionment with policy dictated by Soviet Party leadership had been growing at least since the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 to the point where he completely severed ties with the Party in 1943. Around this time Lending also grew critical of the VALB organization for what he perceived to be its rigid political orthodoxy. He gradually distanced himself from VALB and embarked upon what became a lifelong mission to persuade his former Spanish Civil War comrades, among others, to reject the Communist Party line. He gave talks, conducted correspondence with veterans, publicly challenged VALB in its publication, the Volunteer, and wrote numerous articles and letters to editors on the issue.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Another effort to which Lending devoted much time and energy was raising awareness of Jewish participation in the Spanish Civil War. Among other activities, he joined an endeavor led by veteran Irving Weissman to secure pension rights for struggling Polish Jewish veterans of the Botwin Company; and he initiated a campaign to commemorate Jewish fighters in Spain.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1978, after a brief period managing the family textile business, Lending retired and moved with Florence to Florida. The couple made frequent trips to Israel to be with Lending's stepson and family.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lending died in Florida on September 24, 2003 at the age of 91.</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The Edward Isaac Lending Papers were donated to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives between 1978 and 1994 by Edward Isaac Lending. This collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of ALBA collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University.</field>
