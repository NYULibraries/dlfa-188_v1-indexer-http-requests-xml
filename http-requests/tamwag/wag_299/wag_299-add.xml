    <field name="bioghist_teim">Brenda Berkman is a pioneering female firefighter who worked for the FDNY from 1982 to 2006. She is a founding member and former president of the United Women Firefighters (1982-1986) and served as trustee of the Women in Fire Service (1983-1992). Berkman was born in 1951 and became interested in firefighting as a young girl. She joined the FDNY in 1982 after successfully winning a lawsuit that challenged the department's physical exam, arguing that the tougher requirement discriminated against women and were unnecessary for the job. Berkman was among 47 other women who joined the fire department after passing a revised physical exam. Berkman was promoted to the position of lieutenant in 1994, and captain in 2002. She retired from firefighting in 2006 and shifted to a career in the arts. Most of her work is in stone lithography and copperplate etching which has primarily been inspired by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</field>

    <field name="appraisal_teim">In 2016, issues of major national news publications containing general coverage of the 9/11 attacks, which were deemed to contain minimal research value, were removed from this collection. Duplicate copies of clippings, programs, and brochures were also removed. In 2019, a curatorial decision was made during accession to not retain 6 VHS tapes and a printed booklet as they were determined to be out of scope.</field>
