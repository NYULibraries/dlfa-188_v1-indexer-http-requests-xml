    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Stone Derrickmen and Riggers Association, Local 197 of New York, NY was granted its Charter by the International Association of Bridge, Structural , Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers on September 16, 1916. The International, founded in 1896 by sixteen delegates from across the United States, represents ironworkers laboring on bridges, structural steel, ornamental and architectural metals, and in shops. During the early years of Local 197, the International had frequent jurisdictional disputes with the American Federation of Labor, a factor which contributed to the  failure of the 1919 Great Steel Strike which had attempted to reorganize the industry. With the advent of the New Deal, the International entered a period of expansion which continued through the 1950s. Local 197 worked on a variety of historic projects, including the Cathedral of St John the Divine and the "Columbia Triumphant" statue at Columbus Circle. Originally dominated by German, Jewish and Irish craftsmen, the local's membership became more diverse by the 1980s, as a result of court orders regarding affirmative action.</field>
