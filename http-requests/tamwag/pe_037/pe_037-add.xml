    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) Printed Ephemera Collection contains a selection of printed material produced by the organization from its founding in 1920 up through the 1980s. The collection consists largely of pamphlets, which are arranged chronologically. Also included are a number of reports, resolutions and statements from the CPGB's National Congresses. There is a small amount of material from various departments and committees, including the Women's Department, the Propaganda Department and the Central and Executive Committees as well as from the youth wing of the group known as the Young Communist League.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), founded in 1920, functioned as a section of the Moscow-based Communist International, also known as the Comintern. Though small in membership and parliamentary representation, the CPGB was the largest of the communist parties in Britain. The organization played a role in the 1926 General Strike involving much of the trade union movement in England. The CPGB complied with the stance of the Comintern toward Germany during World War II, eventually calling for full support of the Allies. Divisive debates amongst factions occurred within the group throughout the Cold War causing numerous splits. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought the ultimate demise of the CPGB. At the time membership was 6,300, and those who remained eventually broke away to form new communist organizations, none of which attracted large membership. The Communist Party of Britain now claims to be the direct inheritor of the CPGB.</field>
