    <field name="abstract_teim">Ladislaus F. Szeliga (1912-1991), better known as Stanley Postek, was a seaman, union organizer, volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, and prizefighter from Lowell, Massachusetts. Postek went to sea in the mid-1930s, and became an organizer for the International Seamen's Union of America. Along with other members of the union's rank and file, Postek broke to the National Maritime Union in 1937.

Postek fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War and served as a merchant seaman during World War II. During the Korean War, he was barred from maritime employment, because of his associations with the Communist Party. Once he regained his papers he sailed until retirement in 1966. Postek was also involved in the Marine Workers Historical Association. He died in San Diego in 1991.

The collection includes diaries, photographs, clippings documenting labor activities, sailing paperwork, and union documents. The collection documents the wide range of activities Postek participated in throughout his life, with particular emphasis on his sailing and union activities and his continued interest in these areas after he retired. Information regarding Postek's activities in Spain are represented in the collections Stanley Postek Spanish Civil War Papers (ALBA.089) and Stanley Postek Photographs (ALBA.PHOTO.089), also available at the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Ladislaus F. Szeliga, better known as Stanley Postek, was born on February 5, 1912, in Lowell, Massachusetts. He left school in the mid-1930s and went to sea. At the age of twenty-five, he was a union organizer for the International Seamen's Union of America. When the rank and file broke away to form the National Maritime Union, so did he. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Abraham Lincoln Brigade as a volunteer, fighting on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In World War II, he served as a merchant seaman, most notably on the Murmansk run. After the war, he joined the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. Because of his association with the Communist Party, he was one of 2,000 men "screened" off waterfront employment by the United States Coast Guard during the Korean War. Once he regained his papers, he continued sailing until 1966. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Postek was also a Golden Gloves light-heavyweight boxing champion, and he won brief notoriety after he knocked out the favored champion in the 1937 P.A.U. Tournament. Postek also served as an extra in the film On the Waterfront.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After retirement, Postek was involved with the Marine Workers Historical Association, an organization which sought to bring together those who had been engaged in the organizing efforts on the waterfront and on shipboard in the 1930s, and preserve their history through documents and written and oral accounts. He also taught college courses, and ran a macrame and yarn shop in Greenwich Village, New York City. Postek died at the age of seventy-eight in his San Diego home. His ashes were scattered at sea.</field>
