    <field name="abstract_teim">The Brooklyn Sister City Project was founded in Brooklyn, New York during the late 1980s in order to educate people on the conditions of the Nicaraguan people during the Contra War of the Nicaraguan Revolution. The group's activities demonstrated their support of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN) over the Contras, including their ongoing, personal relationship with their designated "sister city" Dan Juan del Rio Coco. The collection's materials date between 1985 and 1991 and include newsletters, meeting minutes, correspondence, conference materials, brochures, flyers, and clippings.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Brooklyn Sister City Project Records consist of materials from 1985 through 1991 the Brooklyn Sister City Project's connection to the municipality of Dan Juan del Rio Coco in northern Nicaragua during the Contra War of the Nicaraguan Revolution. The collection also documents the organization's support of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN) at a time when the United States government was providing financial and military assistance to the opposing, right-wing militant group, the "Contras." Materials within the collection include newsletters, meeting minutes, correspondence, conference materials, brochures, and flyers. Also of significance are the clippings and memorial materials related to the death of American engineer Benjamin Linder, who was killed by the Contras near the village of  San José de Bocay in 1987.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Brooklyn Sister City Project was founded in Brooklyn, New York during the late 1980s in order to educate people on the conditions of the Nicaraguan people during the Contra War of the Nicaraguan Revolution. Siding with the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN) rather than the Contras, the right-wing militant groups funded by the United States government since the Reagan administration, the organization formed a close relationship with Dan Juan del Rio Coco, a municipality in northern Nicaragua. Not only did the Brooklyn Sister City Project designate Dan Juan del Rio Coco as their "sister city," but the organization also sought to achieve their goals of peace and education through letter writing (to both community members and government officials), by sending local groups to their sister site, and by sponsoring visits of Nicaraguans in Brooklyn. The group also produced a newsletter and hosted a series of fundraising events, lectures, and exhibitions, including a memorial for Benjamin Linder, an American engineer who was killed by the Contras near the village of  San José de Bocay in 1987.</field>
