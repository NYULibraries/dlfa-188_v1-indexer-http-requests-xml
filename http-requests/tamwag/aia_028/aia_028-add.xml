    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) was established in Ireland in 1884 as a part of the Gaelic Revival as a way to encourage the playing of Gaelic football and hurling. Local chapters were opened in Ireland and America throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. While Gaelic games had been played in America since the Irish first emigrated, play was not fully standardized until enthusiasts in New York formed the city's first GAA Board in 1914. They also sought to organize games with teams in other cities along the East Coast. There were three fields of note in New York City for much of the twentieth century: Celtic Park in Queens, the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan, and Gaelic Park (a.k.a. Croke Park) in the Bronx.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">One of the highlights for the New York GAA was the 1947 All-Ireland Gaelic Football Final between Cavan and Kerry. Played at the Polo Grounds, it is the only All-Ireland final played outside of Ireland. It was held in New York to commemorate 100th anniversary of the worst year of the Great Famine, and the thousands of Irish who came to New York as a consequence.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Interest in football and hurling is dependent upon immigration from Ireland and there was a slump in the 1970s. However, the 1980s revived the local GAA, as the influx of undocumented Irish brought with it new players. </field>
