    <field name="bioghist_teim">John Francis O'Donnell (1907-1993) was a New York City lawyer who achieved many victories for labor unions over the span of his 55-year career, particularly for striking transit and postal workers. Born in Donegal, Ireland, O'Donnell was a supporter of the Irish Republican Army. Around age 20, British authorities caught O'Donnell carrying a pistol. He moved to New York to avoid getting into any further trouble with the British government.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">O'Donnell worked various odd jobs after moving to New York, including elevator operator, grocery store clerk, and writer of newspaper editorials for The Irish Echo. He attended night classes at Fordham University, earning his law degree in 1937. O'Donnell formed a law partnership with Asher Schwartz in 1948 and later formed an affiliated law firm in Washington specializing in labor law and union clients.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the 1930s, O'Donnell became an aide and friend to City Councilman Michael J. Quill, who would go on to found and lead the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU). O'Donnell began serving as the TWU's general counsel in 1948, a role he held until his death. He played a key role in the 1980 New York City transit strike, helping to secure pay increases for bus and subway workers. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to his work with the TWU, O'Donnell was the chief lawyer for the American Postal Workers Union. In this role, he sought to protect postal workers' retirement benefits and attacked the use of part-time workers, as workers feared part-time work would threaten full-time positions.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">O'Donnell's daughter, Eileen Ginn, wrote a biography of O'Donnell, A Man from Bruckless, published in 2010.</field>
