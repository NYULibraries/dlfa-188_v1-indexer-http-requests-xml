    <field name="abstract_teim">The Hank Miller Papers includes the materials of long-time Local 424 general president, Hank Miller. He was with the union for almost 50 years, through its many iterations. Initially a union of truck drivers, Local 424 changed several times and came to represent workers from other lines of work, such as industry and public service. It began in the 1950s as the Packing of Grain, Fertilizers and Processors of Allied Food Industries, Independent Local 424 and had many different names until 1999 when it merged with Local 1102 RWDSU UFCW. This collection contains materials related to the history of Local 424, from its formation to its merger (and the aftermath thereof). Materials include meeting minutes and agendas, administrative and financial documents, correspondence and memos, membership ledgers, daily planners, notepads, newspaper clippings and research files, negotiations materials, contracts, newsletters, memoir manuscripts, photographic prints and negatives, publications, audiocassette tapes, a compact VHS tape, buttons, t-shirts, and other artifacts.</field>
