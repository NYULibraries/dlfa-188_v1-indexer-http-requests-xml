    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: Research &amp; Publications consists of material relating to the two main focuses of Cassidy's research: tracing the Irish language in America and African-American/Irish intermarriage in New York City in the 1800s (what Cassidy called "Black Irish").  It includes Cassidy's typed notes and draft manuscripts, annotated historical newspaper clippings and play scripts, census documents, and extensive annotated secondary source material, as well as a large collection of notebooks containing Cassidy's own research notes, which deal with both of these research interests as well as his New College classes.  Although there is some overlap between Cassidy's two areas of focus, the majority of his annotations on the secondary source material, newspapers, and plays have to do with his research on the Irish language and American slang.  Cassidy's annotations on on the census documents focus on African-American/Irish intermarriage.</field>
