    <field name="abstract_teim">Marjorie Heins (1946 - ) is a writer, a former civil rights and civil liberties attorney, and the past director of the Free Expression Policy Project (FEPP) and the American Civil Liberties Union's Arts Censorship Project. Heins has written popular and scholarly articles on free speech, censorship, constitutional law, copyright, and the arts, and has taught at New York University, the University of California - San Diego, Boston College Law School, and the American University of Paris. The Marjorie Heins Papers (dated 1968-2019) consist of materials created and collected by Heins in paper, analog audiovisual, and born-digital format documenting her career as a writer, civil liberties attorney, and founding FEPP director. Materials documenting Heins' research and writing include published articles, subject files, correspondence, reviews, and awards, and predominantly document her books Priests of Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge and Not in Front of the Children: 'Indecency', Censorship, and the Innoncence of Youth. The collection also documents Heins' involvement in the FEPP, including administrative records, research files, interviews, and policy reports on topics such as copyright, fair use, and internet filtering. The collection also includes materials on legal cases and free speech controversies in the 1990s and early 2000s through legal briefs, articles, original writings, and lectures. Audio and video recordings of Heins' public speaking and press appearances are also included in this collection.</field>
