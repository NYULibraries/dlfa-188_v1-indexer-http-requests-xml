    <field name="abstract_teim">The Committees on Correspondence was organized in 1992 after the 1991 Communist Party USA convention as a non-Leninist, democratic socialist organization to dispute the policies and leadership of CPUSA head, Gus Hall. The movement centered around the respected veteran communist and former leading CP official, Gil Green (1906-1997). The Committees on Correspondence sought to reach out to others on the left outside the Party, and held conferences in 1992 and 1994 to formally establish the new organization. Around 2000, the Committee on Correspondence changed its name to the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. The collection includes: letters, memos, statements, minutes, photographs, and emails that document formation of the organization and national leadership meeting minutes.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The content of this collection reflects the origins of the Committees of Correspondence. Since the split with the CPUSA was in large measure connected to different approaches towards democratic processes within the Party, these procedures take up a lot of room in the discussions. There is also discussion of the meaning and relevance of socialism and socialist ideas in light of the collapse of the Communist bloc. Discussions of the envisioned character of the new organization are in various forms: letters, memos, statements, executive committee and national coordinating committee meeting minutes, photographs of members, and emails. The national leadership discussions are documented in detailed minutes and, frequently, hand-written notes by participants; the same is true for the national conventions. Although the Committees of Correspondence consisted of many local branches, it is only the Northern Californians whose activities are reflected here. The correspondence is largely national with some contacts to the international leftist scene.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The late 1980s and early 1990s saw, within the Communist Party of the USA (aka CP or CPUSA), the growth of an informal dissident reformist current, centered around the respected veteran communist and former leading CP official, Gil Green (1906-1997). Prepatory to the CP's November 1991 national convention in Cleveland, this group coalesced under the name "Initiative" to dispute the policies and leadership of CP head Gus Hall. After their defeat, which included an acrimonious credentials struggle that saw the Cleveland police called to enforce the rulings of the Gus Hall-dominated convention, the reformers withdrew from the CP and established the Committees of Correspondence in 1992 as a non-Leninist, democratic socialist organization. The new group, while composed principally of ex-Communists, sought to reach out to others on the left, and held a conference in San Francisco in July 1992, to formally establishing a new organization, which did not occur until the July 1994 convention in Chicago. The organization's name was changed, circa 2000, to the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism.</field>
