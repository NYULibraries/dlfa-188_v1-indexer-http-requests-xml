    <field name="abstract_teim">David Loeb Weiss (c. 1911–2005) was a Polish American socialist activist and filmmaker. The David Loeb Weiss Film Collection contains unedited materials, selects, out-takes, trims, and preservation elements from films across Loeb Weiss' career. Users should be aware that one film's title contains a racial slur, which is a direct quote from a protester depicted in the film. The original language has been maintained in archival description to convey the meaning and historical context of the statement. The films in this collection include Profile of a Peace Parade (1967), No Vietnamese Ever Called Me Nigger (1968), To Make a Revolution (1972), Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu (1980), and Planet Without a Visa (earlier titled I Stake My Life), an uncompleted documentary film about Leon Trotsky. The collection also includes amateur footage of Mountain Spring Camp, a Socialist Workers Party summer resort.</field>
