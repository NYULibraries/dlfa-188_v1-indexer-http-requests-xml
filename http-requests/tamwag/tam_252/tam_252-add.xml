    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This collection is made up of the personal papers of David Dellinger, a peace activist and member of the Chicago Seven and includes correspondence, periodicals, pamphlets, notebooks, writings, newsletters, photographs, teaching materials, and other ephemera. The collection mostly contains materials related to his activism from the 1960s to about 1999, including planning materials for antiwar fasts, protests, and demonstrations against wars, the Middle East conflict, and conflict in South America and Libya or focuses on his life in Vermont in the 1980s and 1990s. The collection also includes materials related to the publication of his book, From Yale to Jail: The Life Story of a Moral Dissenter and the book tour related to it. There is a significant amount of correspondence, including personal letters, correspondence related to the publication and fundraising of Seven Days magazine, and with prisoners and others. There is some materials related to the Chicago Seven case, including court proceedings and contempt trials. While there is not much pertaining to the Chicago Seven trial, this collection is a rich resource for researchers interested in social justice and peace movements in Vermont in the 1980s and 1990s as well as Dellinger's life after the trial that made him famous.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">David Dellinger (1915-2004) is most remembered for his role as the oldest defendant in the 1969 Chicago Seven trial, in which anti-Vietnam War activists were charged with conspiring to disrupt the 1968 Democratic National Convention.  Yet he was a lifelong peace activist and continued to be involved in peace activism in the 1990s.  Additionally, Dellinger was the editor of two leftist publications, Liberation (1956-1977) and Seven Days (1975-1980).  In 1980 he and his family moved to Vermont, where he taught and wrote his memoir From Yale to Jail: The Life Story of a Moral Dissenter (1993).  In addition to his autobiography, he wrote ''Revolutionary Nonviolence'' (1971), ''More Power Than We Know'' (1975), and ''Vietnam Revisited'' (1986).</field>
