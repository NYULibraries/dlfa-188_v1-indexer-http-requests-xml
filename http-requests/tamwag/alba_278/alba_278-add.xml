White's fictional writings about the Spanish Civil War include stories, poems, plays, and songs (some of the latter in Spanish).</field>

There is also an identity certificate issued by the Russian Consul in New York to Ephim White in 1920.  Finally, there is a small amount of material on Milton White's activities after his return from Spain.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III: Scrapbook is made up of pages from a scrapbook kept by White's parents during the time he was in Spain.  Most of the material is in the form of newspaper clippings and flyers.  It covers the subject of the Spanish Civil War, especially as it relates to White, as well as general leftist activities during this period.</field>
