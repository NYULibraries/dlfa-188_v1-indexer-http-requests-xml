She entered the labor movement as an organizer in the 1980s with SEIU District Council 925 and NYC Women Office Workers, a local of 9to5, National Association of Working Women.

Materials documenting Koster's activities as a labor educator include course materials and notebooks, many of which are from Cornell University's Trade Union Studies Program. This collection also includes materials documenting union leadership campaigns and elections through ephemera, petitions, and correspondence. Materials documenting her organizing activities and contract administration with Local 1199, National Union of Hospital and Healthcare Workers include correspondence, background subject files, and a signed summary of tentative agreement.</field>
