    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Collection of materials from the files of Benjamin Doctorich consisting of circa 165 black and white photographs and 42 blueprints documenting the replacement of stonework on New York City's City Hall during the mid-1950s. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The subjects of all the photographs are details of the building, the construction, or construction materials (including numerous close-ups) and  worksites.  Most have dates and detailed captions on the back describing what is shown, in architectural and technical language, as for example, "South Portico,"  "Slope for copper flushing, 3rd floor east elevation," "grouting over first floor window," and "View taken elevation 'A', new granite facing." In addition, many of the images bear a stamp which reads: "NOTE: Check photo number with accompanying drawing(s) for exact location of photographs." Only a small number of these images are full shots of City Hall or its surrounding buildings, and the very few people included in the photographs are clearly incidental to what the photographer intended to document.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The drawings consist of blueprints and working drawings that appear to have been produced by by the contractor that performed the work and/or the architectural firm that produced the designs for the job (the Republic-United Stone Corporation and the architectural firm of Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon, respectively--the names of each appear on the drawings) and they were submitted to and approved by the New York City Department of Public Works. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Benjamin Doctorich was born in the United States, but grew up in Goriizia, a city in northeast Italy near the  Slovenian border. He studied at a Polytechnic school in Vienna and trained as an architectural engineer. He spoke several languages fluently, and traveled extensively. He married in Italy and started a family there.  He then later immigrated to New York City, and lived in the Bronx. In the United States he started a second family and worked drawing, drafting, and building; he also worked as a photographer. He died in 1967, at the age of 84.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Doctorich may have worked for Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon Associates, a prominent architectural firm best known for designing the Empire State Building.</field>
