    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection of the Revolutionary Communist Party provides significant documentation of the Party's activities. The 1.00 linear foot collection spans the years 1970-1983, with the bulk of material spanning 1976-1979. It consists of internal documents including central committee bulletins and position papers, as well as pamphlets, and flyers. Also included in the collection are items from related organizations and other left organizations of this era.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is organized into seven series. Series I, Origins, contains items about the Revolutionary Union and it's evolution into the Party. Series II, National Organization, consists of internal documents and bulletins issued by or to the central committee. Series III contains internal documents issued by or to the district and local organizations. Series IV consists of flyers and other materials documenting the Party's political activities, campaigns, and events. Series V, Topical Files, principally contains position papers dealing with Party issues; many are from members. Series VI, Related Organizations, contains items from other organizations, including the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters, which had members join or leave the RCP. Series VII, Publications, consists of pamphlets and bulletins published by the RCP or the RWHq. Series I and II are arranged chronologically. Series III through VII are arranged alphabetically.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection provides good documentation on the political activities and positions of the RCP, but documentation of the RCP post-1980 is sparse. Many of the materials are undated, and there is no mention of individual members except of the chairman, Bob Avakian.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) was founded in 1975 as the successor to the Revolutionary Union (founded in 1968). It was the first explicitly Maoist organization in the United States. The Party has been led by Bob Avakian since it's founding. The RCP has supported the domestic and foreign policies of The People's Republic of China until Mao's death in 1976 and opposed what they saw as revisionist, social imperialist policies of the Soviet Union.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Two years after the 1976 overthrow of the "Gang of Four" in China, the RCP split. The majority, led by Avakian, felt that the Chinese government had adopted revisionist policies, while the minority, which supported the present regime of the CCP, established the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters. The RWHq remained in the RCP for one year, then merged with the Bay Area Communist Union, the League of Revolutionary Struggle, and other organizations to form the Committee to Unite Marxists-Leninists. In the late 1970's, the RCP shifted it's concentration from heavy industry toward youth and immigrant workers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the mid-1970's, the Party opposed busing, affirmative action, and Black Nationalism, believing them to be non-revolutionary policies. To demonstrate against U.S. expansionist policies they briefly occupied the Alamo. They were instrumental in the organization of the National United Workers Organization and the Unemployed Workers Organizing Committee. In 1982, after a three-year court battle, 17 members, the "Mao Tse Tung defendants", were acquitted of felony charges for allegedly violent activity at a demonstration in Washington, D.C. In 1989 the RCP won a supreme court ruling that flag burning falls under protection of the first amendment. Since 1975, they have published The Worker.</field>
