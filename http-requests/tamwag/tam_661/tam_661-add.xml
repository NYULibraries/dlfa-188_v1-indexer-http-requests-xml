    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Leaflets, position papers, handwritten and typewritten notes (written by Coopersmith, some in shorthand, some on the back of leaflets or as marginalia), mailing lists, armbands, stickers, pamphlets, newspapers, clippings and posters mostly pertaining to student radicalism in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s--mainly, but not only at New York University, and mainly, but not only to Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). There is also a small amount of conservative and Young Republican literature. Also included are research files on subjects of interest to Coopersmith, such as the CIA, Cuba, and syndicalism. The posters were printed during the New York University student strike of May 1970 on the University's own printing presses, when students seized control of the University's print shop during their nearly two-week occupation of Kimball Hall, the university building that housed the presses. Both students and members of off-campus organizations (such as the Black Panthers and Young Lords) produced these posters. Subjects include opposition to the war in Vietnam and Cambodia, to imperialism and police brutality, the deaths of student strikers on the campuses of Kent State and Jackson State that month, and the imposition of an injunction against the occupation of Kimball Hall (one poster urging NYU students to join their "injunction party" and "make revolutionary love in the streets"). One of the posters, satirically describing the signers of the Declaration of Independence as "long-haired radicals," was designed and printed by Coopersmith herself.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Penina Coopersmith attended New York University from 1965 to 1972, where she received a Bachelor of Arts degree. There she was active in the NYU branch of Students for a Democratic Society--managing its New York City office in the summer of 1966--as well as in other progressive political organizations.  Part of her political work included advising young men how to emigrate to Canada to avoid being conscripted to fight in the Vietnam War.  Her political interests also encompassed civil rights and labor union struggles. In 1966, for example, she attended a summer school in Illinois run by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers; the following winter, she traveled with a group of young people to observe a strike by textile workers at Erwin Mills in Dunn, North Carolina, and with Steve Max (an SDS founder) produced a report on the strike that was published by Youth Committee Against Poverty (YCAP).  She was also participated in the occupation of university buildings by students during the NYU student strike of May 1970.  In September, 1971, she moved to Toronto, Canada, and settled there, working as an urban planning and writer.</field>
