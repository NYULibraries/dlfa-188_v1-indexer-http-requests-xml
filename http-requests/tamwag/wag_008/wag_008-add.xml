    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Overall, the Colby papers reflect the efforts of educators and unionists to develop and promote workers' education. The college prospectus, labor pamphlets, manuscripts, and course materials in Series III reveal the methodology and quality of classroom instruction. The Extension Department documents reflect Brookwood's aim to make progressive labor education available to workers everywhere.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulletins, literary scrapbooks, correspondence, syllabi, and labor songs and plays in Series II, III, and IV afford a picture of Brookwood as an educational and social experience for faculty and students. The role of Local 189 and other locals toward a concerted, national effort to organize and educate workers is reflected in the AFT reports and articles in Series I and II.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II and III include documents that reflect the reactions of Brookwood faculty and students to the AFL's condemnation of Brookwood, and on internal controversies in the early 1930s. Other material relates to the financial crisis at Brookwood in the wake of the AFL opposition.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">One of Brookwood's tenets was to train students to become unionists. See the letters in Series II to Colby from former Brookwood students, notably, Columbus Ball, Mike Demchak, Fred Gendral, and Peter Strasse. The letters provide evaluations of the students' Brookwood experiences, and relate their personal struggles and achievements in the labor movement. The student autobiographical sketches in Series III reveal family origin and relate how and why the students came to Brookwood. Unfortunately, the correspondence in Series II yields only about a dozen letters from family and friends with any direct bearing on Colby's personal life. The fact that the donor of the collection separated and discarded personal correspondence and other documents prior to his donation may partially account for this omission.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Colbys, a New England family, settled at Colby's Landing, California, where Josephine Colby was born on April 14, 1878. Colby was tutored at home, then attended high school in Berkeley. She earned a bachelor's degree in 1899 from the University of California, and studied in Chicago at the American Conservatory of Music. Colby was married briefly to Louis Kramer, from 1921-24. She resided at Brookwood Labor College in Katonah, New York, and owned a cottage in Nantucket, Massachusetts which she sometimes leased in the summer.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Colby was dubbed "Polly" by her colleagues and students, ostensibly because there was already a Josephine (Bennett) at Brookwood. Previously a high school teacher in Oakland and Fresno California (1915-19), and an instructor at Chicago Labor College (1921), Colby was an instructor of basic English grammar, structure, and composition. These skills were particularly vital to Brookwood students, many of whom were of foreign origin and limited educational backgrounds. In her twelve year tenure (1922-34) at Brookwood, Colby served as one of the faculty directors on the Brookwood Board of Directors, taught daily classes, advised individual students, and worked on a manuscript titled "Grammar for Workers," which was never completed. Colby also directed the Brookwood Players and the school chorus.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Brookwood Labor College was the successor of a short-lived Brookwood School, begun by William Mann Fincke in the autumn of 1919. Brookwood opened its doors to students in October 1921. The college featured a two-year course in the social sciences which, according to the college prospectus, was intended to "educate workers to work in the workers' movement." </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In 1925 Brookwood became incorporated. Within a few years after its establishment Brookwood was officially endorsed, and in most cases financially supported, by thirteen national and international unions. The college was also one of forty affiliates of the Workers' Education Bureau (WEB). Through its classroom training, institute and conference programs, and its influence in the Labor Publication Society (which issued the monthly magazine Labor Age) Brookwood became a source of opposition to American Federation of Labor (AFL) leadership and policies. The AFL leadership in turn became increasingly suspicious of Brookwood. In 1928 the AFL censured Brookwood and demanded that all affiliates withdraw support from the college. The following year, Brookwood spearheaded the formation of the Conference for Progressive Labor Action. (CPLA)</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Three factors were crucial to Brookwood's decline in the 1930s: fewer unions lent financial support, depression conditions prevailed, and the departure of A.J. Muste (faculty chairman) in 1933 left the college without strong leadership. Although Brookwood finally closed its doors in 1937, many Brookwood staff and graduates played roles in the emerging Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) during the 1930s and 1940s.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In addition to her Brookwood classes, Colby taught evening classes for the New York Central Trades and Labor Council College and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and taught at the Barnard and Bryn Mawr Summer Schools for Women Workers in Industry.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Colby was actively involved in the development of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) during the early 1920s as First Secretary of the California State Federation of Teachers; Vice President and Field Secretary, AFT; and Director of Publicity, Chicago office. She was instrumental in organizing Workers' Education Local 189 (composed of the Brookwood faculty), and served as its president and later secretary.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">After relinquishing her Brookwood post in 1934, Colby went to Moscow and taught English to technicians at the Institute of Languages. No precise death date has been confirmed; however, one of Colby's correspondents believes that she died in 1938.</field>
