    <field name="abstract_teim">Leo Isacson (1910-1996) was an attorney and politician from Bronx, NY. In a 1948 special election he was elected to the seat for New York's 24th District of the United States House of Representatives as the American Labor Party candidate. The victory shocked the political establishment and commentators. In that November's general election, the mainstream political parties worked in a coalition to unseat him.

The collection chronicles Isacson's life, with particular emphasis the 1948 campaign and his subsequent service in Congress. Included are clippings, photographs, campaign materials, correspondence, and writings. There are four boxes of scrapbooks, comprised primarily of clippings, that document the campaign, Isacson's brief career in the House, and the analysis of Isacson's unexpected victory.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Leo Isacson (1910-1996) was an attorney and politician from Bronx, NY. In a 1948 special election he was elected to the seat for New York's 24th District in the United States House of Representatives as the American Labor Party candidate. The victory shocked the political establishment and commentators. Isacson's tenure in the House coincided with the escalation of the Cold War, and while a member of the House of Representatives, the State Department denied him a passport to travel to France. In the general election in the November of that year, the mainstream political parties worked in a coalition to unseat him. Following his defeat, Isacson returned to his law practice, and later in life he taught political science at Nova University in Fort Lauderdale.</field>
