    <field name="abstract_teim">Dr. Jack G. Shaheen (1935-2017) was a professor, author, and consultant who dedicated his career to identifying and contesting stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in American media. The Jack G. Shaheen Papers date from 1943 to 2012 and document Shaheen's scholarly and popular writing and research in media analysis; his media accountability activism through the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC); and his consultation work on legal cases as well as the entertainment industry. The collection includes printed and born-digital draft and revised writings, speeches, notes, research and subject files, reports, correspondence, and sound and video recordings of Shaheen's speeches. The collection also contains material collected by Shaheen, including comic books; editorial cartoons; recordings of movies, television shows, and cartoons; magazines; posters; advertisements; toys; games; and other ephemera, which depict Arabs and Muslims in American popular culture and mass media from the late 19th to the 21st centuries.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Jack G.

The collection includes Shaheen's writings, speeches, research files, notes, and correspondence in print, audiovisual, and born-digital formats.  Shaheen's media accountability work, carried out both independently and with the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), is also represented through correspondence, writings, research, case files, and written reports. The bulk of the collection includes material collected by Shaheen which depicts Arabs and Muslims in American popular culture and mass media from the late 19th to the 21st century, much of which he used in his writings and speeches.  These materials include recordings of movies, television episodes, cartoons, and music videos; comic books; editorial cartoons; motion picture posters and stills; advertisements; video and board games; film and television scripts; a Halloween mask; t-shirts; toys; and other ephemera.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dr. Jack G. Shaheen (1935-2017) was a professor, author, and consultant who dedicated his career to identifying and contesting stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in American media.  His research analyzes the origins of these stereotypes, their persistence, the ways in which they affect perceptions of Arabs and Muslims in society, and presents solutions to counter them effectively.  He was a professor emeritus of Mass Communications at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, Illinois where he taught between 1969 and 1994, and was a Fulbright lecturer in Mass Communications at the American University of Beirut in 1974 and 1975 and at the University of Jordan in 1982.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Shaheen began his research into Arab stereotypes in 1974 and collected materials which contained Arab stereotypes, both negative and positive.  He wrote books, popular and scholarly articles, and op-eds, and lectured at colleges and universities, private institutions, and at conferences and conventions.  After the events of September 11, 2011, he documented and fought stereotypes of Muslims as well.  His books include The TV Arab (1984), Guilty: Hollywood's Verdict on Arabs after 9/11 (2008), and Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People (2001), which was produced as a documentary in 2006.  Shaheen worked as a consultant on legal cases and in the entertainment industry, most notably on the films Three Kings (1999) and Syriana (2005).</field>

    <field name="custodhist_teim">Roughly 73 linear feet of video recordings (VHS cassettes and DVDs) and films were separated from the paper materials in 2011 and a video collection (VIDEOS.015) was created for these materials.  In 2015, the VHS cassettes and DVDs were deaccessioned from the collection and sent to the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at NYU.  Commercially available titles were returned to the Tamiment Library and reincorporated into the collection in June 2017.   In October 2017 two boxes of material were sent to the Tamiment Library from the Asian/Pacific/American Institute containing sound recordings, commercial video recordings, and paper material.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">Duplicative clippings, periodicals, and video recordings were deaccessioned.  One blank floppy disk was deaccessioned.</field>
