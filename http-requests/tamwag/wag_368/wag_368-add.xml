    <field name="abstract_teim">Rebecca Patt Cohen (1941-2020) was a teacher in the New York City schools, a coordinator for the first American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors, Program Director for the Workmen's Circle, and Program Director for the Jewish Community Council of Yonkers. She, along with her second husband Joe Cohen, was an avid collector of postcards, ephemera, and objects concerning labor, Judaica, and local Bronx and Brooklyn history. Patt Cohen was the daughter of immigrants who escaped Nazi-occupied Europe and settled in the Amalgamated Housing Cooperative in the Bronx after obtaining visas through writer and activist Jacob Pat (Patt Cohen's grandfather) and the Jewish Labor Committee. The Rebecca Patt Cohen Collection of Labor Ephemera (dated 1887-1982) consists of materials collected by Patt Cohen documenting the labor movement and Progressive Jewish social movements. Materials include union membership cards, AFL-CIO convention delegate badges, postcards and stereoscopes of labor movement parades and demonstrations, a war ration book, union patches, matchbook covers, and a Black Miss Union Made doll. Workmen's Circle is well represented through postcards, a Yiddish constitution, and flags and pennants. This collection also includes objects created and distributed by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) and the Women's American ORT (Organization for Rehabilitation through Training), which document the gendered forms of outreach and publicity employed by garment workers' unions, such as purses, aprons, nail files, and jewelry.</field>
