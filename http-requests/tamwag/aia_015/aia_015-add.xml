    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The bulk of the collection consists of the working papers of Brian McGinn, a writer and scholar of the Irish Diaspora, whose particular interests were the Irish in Latin America, the West Indies, early colonial America and Canada, as well as those Irish who served with American forces during the Korean and Vietnam wars.
The collection is divided into several series. Series I includes articles and other items authored by McGinn and some personal papers. Series II-X are organized geographically while Series XI and XII pertain to veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars, including documentation on granting of posthumous citizenship to several soldiers.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The files consist mainly of photocopies of articles and sometimes books, as well as bibliographic information used by McGinn in his research. Folder dates often correspond to the original date of photocopied items to give the research an idea of the source material McGinn used. Many photocopies are of original texts from the 17th and 18th centuries. Original correspondence, either letters or email, is included with some files are are photographs and maps of certain areas of study. Many folders in the Korean and Vietnam War Veterans series also include photographs of individuals and these folders are identified.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Brian McGinn (1946-2005), was an Irish American scholar and writer who studied the Irish Diaspora in such diverse places as Latin America, the West Indies, early colonial America, Mexico, and Canada.  McGinn was born in New York City to Irish immigrant parents from Monaghan and Sligo.  His parents were active members of Irish American organizations such as the Ladies Auxiliary of the United Irish Counties Association and Gaelic Football Clubs.  After his mother died in 1951, McGinn and his sister returned to Ireland where they were raised and educated.  In 1964, after completing high school, McGinn returned to New York and worked for the News Bureau of LIFE Magazine while attending evening classes at Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY).  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">McGinn was drafted by the U.S. Military in 1968 and served as an intelligence specialist at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.  From 1969 to 1970 he served in Vietnam on assignment with the 519th Military Intelligence Battalion and was awarded the Join Services Commendation Medal. After being discharged, he completed his BA under the GI Bill and returned to Time-Life in 1972.  He moved to Virginia with Time-Life Books in 1976, working as a staff writer and editor.  He later became a freelance contributor to various publications, such as Irish Roots and Irish America magazine. In 1979 he married Mary Moran, of Co. Mayo.  The couple had a son, Michael.    </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Later in his career McGinn began to study the Irish in the Korean and Vietnam Wars.  As a Vietnam veteran himself, this topic had personal meaning for him.  He was also involved on a collaborative website about the Irish in Korea with Marilyn Knapp Litt  (http://www.illyria.com/irishkor.html) as well as another site "Irish on the Wall" (http://www.illyria.com/vn_irish_names.html) referring to the Vietnam Veterals Memorial in Washington D.C.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">McGinn earned an MA in Latin American Studies from Georgetown University and published extensively on the history of the Irish in Latin America. In addition to the Irish Roots and Irish America magazine, he wrote for newspapers and magazines such as the Irish Times and the Irish Echo's IE.  McGinn died on July 20, 2005.</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The Archives of Irish America received the collection in the Fall of 2005.  The Archives had previously contacted Brian McGinn at the suggestion of historian Kerby Miller, and then negotiated directly with McGinn concerning the collection.  The collection was packed by the McGinn family and shipped by McGinn's widow following his death.   </field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">The accession numbers associated with this collection are 1997.012 and 2012.057.</field>
    <field name="appraisal_teim">In 2021, one record carton was deaccessioned from the collection. The box contained commercially published books and scholarly journals.</field>
