    <field name="abstract_teim">George Tselos (1939- ) is a labor historian and a retired National Park Service archivist. Tselos was an early member of the Socialist Worker Party. The George Tselos Papers (dated 1911-1998; bulk 1957-1982) consists of materials created and collected by Tselos documenting his political engagements and professional career as an archivist and labor historian. Through correspondence, ephemera, publications, and original writings the collection documents Tselos' student activism in the 1960s and engagement with the Socialist Workers Party, as well as his academic research and writings on disarmament, the 1939 WPA strike, and the history of trade unions. The collection also includes personal correspondence, a portion of which is between Tselos and his family regarding his developing radical thought as a student activist.</field>
