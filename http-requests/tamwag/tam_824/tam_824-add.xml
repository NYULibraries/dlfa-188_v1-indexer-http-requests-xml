    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz Papers contain material dating from the 1970s to the 2010s documenting her personal life and professional career, as well as the ways in which her identity as a lesbian, anti-racism and economic justice activist, and member of the Jewish community influenced this work. This collection contains published writings including short stories, poetry, reviews, as well as essays and articles on anti-semitism, homophobia, immigration, racism and anti-racism, and relations between Israel and Palestine. Her college and university course syllabi and notes in this collection reflect topics she also wrote about and supported, including women's and Jewish history. Her correspondence reflects both her personal relationships with others and her life as an educator, writer, and activist during the 1970s to 2010s. Journals, notebooks, and datebooks provide a daily record of her life, but also were often used as inspiration for many of her creative writing projects. Event files containing programs and promotional material document the Jewish Left and feminist environment in the 1970s through 2000s through the wide range of conferences and panels she participated in. The majority of material in this collection related to Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) are publications, organization promotional material, and event fliers.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz (1945-2018) was an American writer, educator, and political activist whose efforts focused on economic and social justice. She was one of the founders of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) and served as the organization's first Executive Director. Kaye/Kantrowitz self-identified as a "Conscious Jew"; she was a member of the Jewish feminist organization Di Vilde Chayes, and her activism often focused on anti-semetism, anti-racism, and economic justice. She was additionally a co-founder of Beyond the Pale (weekly radio program of JFREJ), an editor for the publication Sinister Wisdom, and was on the steering committee for the New Jewish Agenda.


Kaye/Kantrowitz was a college professor who lectured on women's studies, comparative literature, urban studies, gender and queer studies, Jewish studies, and public policy programs at various institutions including Hamilton College, Vermont College, and Queens College. Kaye/Kantrowitz was a published essayist and poet, and authored several books including: We Speak in Code: Poems and Other Writings (1980); The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology (1989); My Jewish Face, and Other Stories (1990); The Issue is Power: Essays on Women, Jews, Violence and Resistance (1995); and The Colors of Jews: Racial Politics and Radical Diasporism (2007).</field>
    <field name="acqinfo_teim">Donated by Kaye/Kantrowitz's partner, Leslie Cagan, in April 2023. The accession number associated with this donation is 2023.052</field>
    <field name="custodhist_teim">The materials were originally stored in boxes in the donor and Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz's home. Some materials may have previously been kept in Kaye/Kantrowitz's offices in Queens College before being transferred to her home. Between April 2022 and January 2023, the boxes were condensed from the original number, having been reboxed by the donor, after they reviewed materials and separated out what they felt was not relevant or personal in nature. The material did not have a specific arrangement or filing system, but there were clear groupings which included files on teaching, writings, journals, and JFREJ organizational material. 


As of February, 2023 the donor will retain some of Kaye/Kantrowitz's original writings, but with a possibility of future donations. Similarly, as of the initial site visit, Kaye/Kantrowitz's computer files are not accessible.</field>
