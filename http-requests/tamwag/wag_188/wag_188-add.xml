    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The records of UAW 2110, 1942-2004 consist of contracts and agreements between organizations and their employees, pamphlets and brochures, correspondence including emails, shop files, reports, financial material and VHS tapes. The UAW 2110 records reflect their affiliations with a variety of institutional associations. The Brooklyn Historical Society, Long Island Historical Society, National Law Journal, Royal Business School and Riverside Church are among them. Club Med, the vacation company, the Silent Watchman, a home alarm company, and the Glemby Corporation, which in the 1990s was the nation's largest department store hair salon chain all had distinct subseries in the collection. Glemby Corporation records include occupational safety surveys, as well as negotiations and employee claims. The Silent Watchman negotiations concern the United Wholesale and Warehouse Employees.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the UAW 2110 records District 65, United Auto Workers (UAW). District 65 traces its origins to the Wholesale Dry Goods Workers Union and New York's Lower East Side. It was one of many unions formed during the early years of the Great Depression. For a considerable period its membership consisted of primarily Jewish garment workers. The Union has a progressive and politically active history. It stood against McCarthyism during the virulent anti-communist, red scare era and stood against the Vietnam War decades later. The records related to District 65 are primarily financial, but also include an election, general information and a Black Lake retreat. The time period covered is from 1980-1989. In 1992 District 65 merged with Local 2110. Local 2110 acquired the records of former bargaining units, including academic records primarily address organizing campaigns (Yale, Boston University). The Historical Societies, Church Organizations and Misc are primarily former bargaining units of D 65 including agreements, correspondence and employee claims.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In 2002 NYU's teaching, research and graduate assistants won major economic gains and a first-ever union contract with UAW 2110. In 2004 the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) overturned the decision. There are a few records primarily email correspondence related to NYU which was officially part of UAW 2110 from 2000 to 2004.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Technical, Office and Professional (TOP) Union, Local 2110, is an amalgamated union with 30 contracts covering over 3,000 workers in universities, publishing, museums, law firms and other offices. They represent teachers, secretaries, administrators, editors, computer operators, librarians, museum curators, typesetters and graphic artists, among many others. The union claims that they've taken the lead in organizing women and workers in non—profits who never had been organized before. UAW 2110's focus on establishing these non-traditional affiliations and servicing their needs is a quality that makes this local unique. They have broken new ground in winning benefits such as childcare, flex—time, job classification, domestic partner benefits and family leave and claim to have the experience necessary to organize and negotiate for "white collar" workers. Their offices are at two locations in New York City, 256 West 38th Street, Suite 704 and 430 W. 119"' Street in Morningside Heights, their area of representation includes New England, Washington D.C., New York metropolitan area, and Puerto Rico. Some organizations they work with are:</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Addison—Wesley Longman Publishers  Ames &amp; Rollinson  AMSCO School Publications  Barnard College  Bronx Museum of the Arts  Church World Service  Columbia University  DASNY: Dormitory Authority of the State of New York  Feminist Press  GOLES: Good Old Lower East Side  HarperCollins Publishers  HFA: New York State Housing Finance Agency  ICCR: Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility  Mercy College  Monthly Review  Museum of Modern Art, New York  National Council of Churches  New Press  NYANA: New York Association for New Americans  New York Civil Liberties Union  New—York Historical Society  Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky &amp; Lieberman, P.C.  SONYMA: State of New York Mortgage Agency  Stamford Advocate  State Bank of India  TCI: Technical Careers Institute  Teachers College  Union Theological Seminary  Village Voice </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Some current organizing campaigns include: the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, New York University Graduate Student Organizing Committee and Columbia University Teaching and Research Assistants (GSEU). Local 2110 is actively involved in ongoing struggles to unionize each of these institutions. 2110 is a Local, part of the (UAW) United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. The UAW was founded in 1935 and is one of the largest and most diverse unions in the North America.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Some of the issues UAW 2110 advocates are health care reform, the rights of employees when faced with intimidation by employers for participating in Union activities and bargaining rights.</field>
