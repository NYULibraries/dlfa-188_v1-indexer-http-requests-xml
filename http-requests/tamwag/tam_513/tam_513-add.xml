    <field name="bioghist_teim">United For Peace and Justice (UFPJ) was founded in 2002 in Washington DC, and began as a national campaign to bring together a broad range of organizations throughout the United States to help coordinate work against a U.S. war on Iraq. Its first major rally took place on February 15, 2003, global day of protest, called The World Says No to War. UFPJ helped coordinate and publicize more than 790 demonstrations worldwide. Two days after the bombing of Iraq began, on March 22, 2003, UFPJ mobilized more than 300,000 people for a protest march down Broadway in New York City, which in successive years would be a major protest day for the UFPJ.  Its first National Assembly took place in June of 2003, coordinating actions against President George W. Bush's war policies and solidifying UFPJ's organizational structure. The Assembly met again in 2005, 2007, and 2009, organizing its anti-war and other campaigns.</field>
