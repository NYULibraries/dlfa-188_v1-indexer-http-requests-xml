    <field name="abstract_teim">The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), founded in 1919 by members of the left wing of the Socialist Party USA, played an important role in the labor movement, particularly in the building of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, in struggles for civil rights for African Americans, while its cultural initiatives attracted a number of prominent artists and intellectuals, and its struggles to attain and maintain its legality were an important chapter in the history of U.S. civil liberties. The collection contains interviews with 41 Communist Party leaders and activists, including several founding members. The bulk of the interviews were conducted during the 1980s by Mary Licht, then chair of the Party's History Commission. Interviews with African American and Jewish Party members comprise the majority of the collection.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), founded in 1919 by members of the left wing of the Socialist Party USA, played an important role in the labor movement, particularly in the building of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the 1930s-1940s, in struggles for civil rights for African Americans, while its cultural initiatives attracted a number of prominent artists and intellectuals, and its struggles to attain and maintain its legality were an important chapter in the history of U.S. civil liberties. Its membership peaked during World War II, reaching some 80,000, organized and led various more broadly based organizations such as the Civil Rights Congress and the International Workers Order, and Communist-led labor unions had a membership of over one million. Its large Jewish membership, and its militant advocacy of civil rights for African Americans are reflected in the backgrounds of the majority of the interviewees.</field>
