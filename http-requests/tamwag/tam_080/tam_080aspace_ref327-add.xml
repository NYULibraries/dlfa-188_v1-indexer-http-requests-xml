    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The material in this part of the collection is primarily concerned with Communist Party activity in the labor movement during the 1920s and 1930s. There are several historical essays on CP development; a short study of the left wing in American trade unions, 1921-1925; and a history of the Party in the Food Workers Industrial Union. These studies in manuscript are supplemented by articles from communist and labor journals concerning CP labor policies and factional disputes and, in some cases, lengthy interviews with leading figures. Extensive reading notes on the political left and on communist influence in labor, particularly in the needle trades and in coal, and notes on CP minutes complete the section. The minutes are from the Political Committee, 1925-1928; the Trade Union Educational League and the Trade Union Unity League; the Trade Union Committee of the Central Executive Committee, 1923-1927; and a Party Conference, 1930.</field>
