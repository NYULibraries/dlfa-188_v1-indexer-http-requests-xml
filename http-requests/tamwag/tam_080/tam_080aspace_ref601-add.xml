    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 1982 Addendum to the Daniel Bell Research Files on U.S. Communism, Socialism, and the Labor Movement contains material dating from 1900 to 1962, with the bulk of the items falling between 1925 and 1958. The addendum are arranged in a single continuous alphabetical series by folder heading. Folder titles are of two types: (1) subject headings retained from those used by Daniel Bell, and (2) names, derived from the author or interviewee whose material constitutes the folder's contents. A small quantity of miscellaneous publications have been filed with the collection. Most correspondence is filed together with the working documentation to which it relates, but all loose correspondence has been gathered under a folder with that heading. Correspondence of note filed within other files includes communications from Earl Browder (box 51, folder 2), Norman Thomas (box 54, folder 4), and B.J. Widdick (box 54, folder 14). Listed under Daniel Bell are drafts for his various writings. These include chapters from his study, Marxian Socialism in the United States(Princeton, 1967). Also present are extensive manuscript notes by Bell, retained together with printed material relating to them. These materials document Bell's creative process, showing how his writing evolved. Another significant strength of the addendum is the collection of interviews with prominent labor and left political figures. The Congress of Industrial Organizations is the subject of several of the interviews, and of early documentation concerning both it and constituent unions. In addition a series of "discs" have been separated from the collection. (Most of the discs contain notes sent by Bell from Paris in 1957 to the New York based study of the American Left done by The Fund for the Republic, Inc., and transcripts are present.)</field>
