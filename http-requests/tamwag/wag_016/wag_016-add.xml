    <field name="bioghist_teim">After graduating from Columbia University in 1966, Christopher Rhoades Dykema began working at the New York City Department of Social Services, Kingsbridge Welfare Center as a caseworker and joined the Social Service Employee Union (SSEU); the union, now SSEU, AFSCME DC 37, Local 371, was then independent. It had been formed when caseworkers split from Local 371 in 1962. He served as an alternate delegate for the union while at Kingsbridge.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Dykema left the Welfare Center for a few years and returned in 1970 to the Bronx Bureau of Child Welfare, where he was active in setting up the Bureau in the union. In the early 1970s, he served as an alternate delegate and delegate from Bronx BCW. He also served as grievance committee chairman and chapter secretary. He participated in contract bargaining (1970-1974) and represented SSEU-Local 371 on the New York City Central Labor Council (1972-1974).</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Christopher Dykema was a member of the union during the merger in 1968 of the SSEU and Local 371, and dealt with the aftermath of the reorganization plan set forth after the merger. In the 1969 contract, the union abandoned the caseload limitations and some hiring demands in return for extra money. However, caseloads continued to grow and this collection reflects the caseload problems of the Bureau of Child Welfare. Adding to these problems was the profound effect of the budgetary crisis in New York City in 1975 along with the spiraling inflation of the rest of the decade. This brought about new concerns for the union relating to job security, decline of services to clients, and pay increases based on a weak economy.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">During this time, Mr. Dykema was also active in various leftist political organizations, including Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and the New American Movement (NAM).</field>
