    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: General Files, 1946-2008, consists of a broad range of printed material published by and collected about the Communications Workers of America. There are constitutions and convention proceedings as well as reports from executive board members. In this series there are also a number of files on prominent leaders and staff members of the Communications Workers of America. These files include material on CWA Presidents and national officers, Joseph Beirne, Glenn Watts, Morton Bahr and Barbara Easterling as well as leaders in various locals and districts.  There are pamphlets and publications put out by the Education and Training Departments, including songbooks and manuals, as well as numerous brochures outlining membership in the CWA, benefits, union democracy, and collective bargaining among other basic facts about unions. This series contains several works outlining the history of telephone workers and organizing in the telephone industry, as well as numerous clippings documenting a broad range of events in CWA history. Information about important strikes from 1947-2000, including the 1989 strike with NYNEX, can also be found in this series. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Districts and Locals, 1941-2006, contains material generated by the locals and districts of the Communications Workers of America all across the United States. However, the activities of locals from the New York and New Jersey area are better represented. Included in this series, is material on various rank and file committees of Local 1101 of New York City, including the publication The Bell Wringer, as well as the United Action Caucus and the Telephone Workers Legal Defense Committee. The Workers Education Local 189, once a part of the American Federation of Labor and now known as the United Association for Labor Education, sent out informative mailings and newsletters, the collection contains a sampling of these mailings from 1994-2000, as well as directories to labor education. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series III: Agreements and Contracts, 1947-2008, consists of five boxes of agreements and contracts. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The Communications Workers of America was founded in 1947, the culmination of over fifty years of organizing efforts in the telephone industry. During the next twenty-five years and under the leadership of Joseph A. Beirne the CWA moved aggressively to organize all the telephone workers in the United States. AT&amp;T with its monopolistic control resisted. It was, however, not until 1974 after years of labor-management unrest and a series of strikes that AT&amp;T agreed to system wide collective bargaining. Shortly after the national contract was signed Beirne died and was replaced as President by Secretary-Treasurer Glenn E. Watts. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">In the 1980s the CWA began to expand beyond telecommunications creating a Public Employees Department that successfully organized 34,000 New Jersey state workers in 1981. In 1985 Morton Bahr became the CWA President. The CWA continued to grow due to a series of mergers. In 1987 the it merged with the International Typographical Workers Union, in 1992 it absorbed the National Association of Broadcast Employees, and in 1995 the Newspaper Guild merged with the CWA as well. </field>
