    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series V. General Subject Files, 1937-1987.This series consists of primary and secondary materials collected by Martin in the course of her research. Notable are correspondence, leaflets and brochures related to Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee; correspondence to Martin from German volunteers held at Gurs Concentration Camp; correspondence and articles related to Jewish participation in the Spanish Civil War; clippings and notes related to aid to refugees and exiles; primary materials from the American Relief Ship for Spain and the American Rescue Ship Mission, including a donation booklet; and bibliographic sources on the Spanish Civil War.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">General materials on veterans and VALB are located in this series. The VALB files span the late 1940s through the 1980s. Particularly noteworthy are questionnaires sent by Martin and filled out by 36 veterans who were treated for wounds in Spain; memos, reports and clippings related to VALB and the Subversive Activities Control Board; programs and materials from VALB's 40th anniversary event honoring women; and notes and statements clarifying the relationship between VALB and Medical Bureau personnel.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Much of this series is given over to the copious research notes Martin took at various repositories, chiefly at the New York Public Library and Columbia University. Martin obtained thousands of pages of photocopies from Columbia University's Spanish Refugee and Relief Organization (SRRO) collection in her efforts to document the administrative history of the Medical Bureau. [Note: These photocopies have been retained, however permission to publish these photocopied materials must be obtained in writing from Columbia University's Librarian for Rare Books and Manuscripts].</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The correspondence between Martin and Brandeis University archivist Victor Berch, who provided extensive research assistance to Martin, is a useful source of information on the course of her work, and on the establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives at Brandeis. This series also includes many files of articles Martin clipped from the Cuernavaca papers (chiefly in Spanish with some English), mostly on politics and culture in Spain during the 1970s and 1980s.</field>
