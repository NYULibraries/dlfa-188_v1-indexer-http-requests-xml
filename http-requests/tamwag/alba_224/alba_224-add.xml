    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection consists of paper and born-digital material accumulated by Moe Fishman during his many years as Secretary of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. It includes incoming correspondence from Lincoln Brigade veterans and others, among them representatives of veterans' organizations in Spain and elsewhere in Europe.  Also included are clippings, pamphlets, memorabilia and photographs (many of them related to gatherings of Spanish Civil War veterans), letters written by Fishman to Howard Lederer during his service in Spain, and some family papers.  Also in the collection is a small body of papers and photographs belonging to Lincoln Brigade veteran, Court Bevensee; these were entrusted to Fishman at the time of Bevensee's death.  Document types include correspondence, publicity items, organizational records and reports, clippings and photocopies of clippings, popular publications and article reprints, photographs, videos, and audio recordings of interviews, events, and musical performances.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Mosess (Moe) Fishman was born in New York City in 1915.  He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City and enrolled in City College, but did not finish college for financial reasons. He later worked in a laundry and driving a truck.  </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Fishman joined the Young Communist League and became involved in anti-fascist activity in the mid-1930s.  In 1937 he volunteered to fight in Spain with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, taking part in the Brunete offensive, where he was severely wounded when a sniper's bullet shattered his thigh.  He spent the next three years in and out of hospitals in Spain and the U.S.  He had recovered sufficiently to serve in the Merchant Marine in World War II.  After the War he returned to New York and became active in aiding Spanish refugees. In 1951, he took over as Secretary-Treasurer (later Secretary) of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) when the organization was labeled "subversive" by the Attorney General's office. After a strenuous legal battle, the label was removed in the 1970s.  He remained a political activist and kept his post with VALB until his death in 2007.</field>
