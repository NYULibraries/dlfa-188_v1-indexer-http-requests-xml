    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The Lee Baxandall Papers (dates 1888-2001, bulk 1965-1989) contain writings, research files, and correspondence related to the works of leftist literary critic Lee Baxandall. Research files in this collection focus predominantly on Marxist scholars and intellectuals, with the most intensive research on the works of Brecht. These files were compiled in the 1960s and 1970s and largely consist of Baxandall's notes and copies of theoretical works by a variety of mid-19th and early-20th century artists and intellectuals. A small portion of these files more specifically address topics related to early-American socialist theater.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection also contains drafts of Baxandall's writings and translations of works by Marxist intellectuals. The majority of his translations relate to the writings of Polish philosopher Stefan Morawski, and include extensive correspondence between the two. Materials related to Baxandall's writings also include translation of the works of Wilhelm Reich, and correspondence with publishers and colleagues regarding his various projects. </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A second donation of Baxandall's papers received in 2004 includes additional research files, drafts, notes, correspondence, and newspaper clippings related to Baxandall's work in literary criticism. A substantial amount of these materials consist of additional correspondence and drafts related to Baxandall's work with Stefan Morawski. These materials are largely dated after 1975, and reflect both the personal and professional relationship between Baxandall and Morawski. There are also drafts of Baxandall's plays and poetry, which include copies of scripts, photographs, flyers, and published works. Baxandall's best represented plays are Potsy and Claws of the Eagle, Claws of the Jaguar. Additionally, the collection contains periodicals, essays, and ephemera related to Baxandall's interest in the politics of sexual expression and his advocacy of naturism. It also includes correspondence and publications produced by the small press Green Mountain Editions in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Lee Baxandall was a publisher and literary critic who specialized in Marxism and aesthetics. Born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1935, he received an MA in English from the University of Wisconsin--Madison where he also pursued doctoral studies in comparative literature and wrote extensively on Marxist theatre, art, and literature. At the University of Wisconsin he became attracted to New Left scholarship, and later became an editor for the journal Studies on the Left from 1960-1967. Baxandall had a special interest in the works of German playwright and poet Bertolt Brecht and translated many of his plays into English. He edited several anthologies on Marxism and literature, and published essays on art criticism in periodicals including: The Nation, Partisan Review, Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, and the New York Times.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Throughout his publishing career, Baxandall worked closely with Polish philosopher Stefan Morawski. He translated several of Morawski's works on aesthetics into English for publication in the United States. In 1973 Baxandall and Morawski co-edited the anthology Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels on Art and Literature, which they later republished in 1974 for the series Documents on Marxist Aesthetics (DOMA). Baxandall and Morawski worked together for several years to produce an additional 11 volumes in the series, but it appears that they were never completed.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Baxandall lived in New York City throughout much of the 1960s, but returned to his home in Oshkosh following the death of his father in 1970. Baxandall ran the publishing company Green Mountain Editions, which produced issues of the periodical Green Mountain Quarterly between 1975 and 1977. Baxandall was also a proponent of naturism and the Free Beach movement. He was the founder of the Naturist Society in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and wrote a popular guide to nude beaches in 1986. He died in Oshkosh in 2008.</field>
