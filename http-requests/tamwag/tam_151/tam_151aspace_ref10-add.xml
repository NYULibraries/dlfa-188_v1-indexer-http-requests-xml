    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This series contains the remainder of Lee Baxandall's papers, which were donated to Tamiment Library in 2004. These materials contain an assortment of research files, drafts, notes, correspondence, and newspaper clippings related to Baxandall's writings. Writings in this series relate to Baxandall's work in literary criticism and include drafts of articles, essays, lectures. The series contains additional materials related to his collaborations with Stefan Morawski. The bulk of these materials relate to the anthology Marx and Engels on Art and Literature, which they co-edited together. These materials consist of drafts and correspondence regarding the licensing and the publication of a follow-up edition for the Documents in Marxist Aesthetics (DOMA) series. Drafts and research for subsequent volumes in the DOMA series are also included among these materials, but it appears that the later volumes were never completed.</field>
