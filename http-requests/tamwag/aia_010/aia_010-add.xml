    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection documents James J. Comerford's career from the 1960s onward, specifically his nomination to a Federal Judgeship, his membership in Irish American and other associations, and his personal life.  Career files include correspondence from notable figures written in support of Comerford's nomination to the Federal Court. Notable correspondents include politicians such as John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Tip O'Neill as well as labor union leaders such as Mike Quill of the Transport Workers Union and Harry Van Arsdale of the AFL-CIO.   Of interest in the collection are Comerford's original handwritten drafts and typed manuscript for the memoir My Kilkenny IRA Days.  Comerford joined the IRA in his teens and the memoir covers the years 1920-1923, providing an intimate look at the activities of this citizen soldier organization and as well as life in Ireland in the early 20th century.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Comerford kept some of his educational materials from obtaining his high school diploma, Bachelor's from Columbia University, and Master's and JD from Fordham, including course listings and grades, which can be found in Series I under Education.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Comerford was active in several organizations in New York, notably the Saint Patrick's Day Parade and Celebration Committee and the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH).  He was also the editor of the AOH's publication, the Hibernian Digest, and the collection contains several files on his activities in the Order, as well as photographs and negatives used in the Digest.  Newspaper clippings which are quite fragile and brittle with age document Comerford's career and personal life.  Numerous photographs of Judge Comerford and his wife Vera are included in Series II, as are images of Comerford involved in activities pertaining to the St. Patrick's Day Parade, AOH and other associations.  </field>

In his teens Comerford joined the Irish Republican Army and discusses his experiences in the year 1920-1923 in his memoir My Kilkenny IRA Days.  In 1925 he immigrated to New York City and worked at a variety of jobs including as a ticket agent for the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) at night while attending college during the day.  When Comerford was 33 he earned a high school diploma and then at the age of 34 matriculated at Columbia to earn his Bachelor's degree.
