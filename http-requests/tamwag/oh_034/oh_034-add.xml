    <field name="abstract_teim">Burton Hall was born in South Orange, New Jersey in 1929. He graduated from Williams College in 1951 and Yale Law School in 1954. Hall set up his own practice in 1960, and soon his work was almost entirely comprised of rank-and-file members suing to protect their democratic rights within their unions. He was one of the pioneer attorneys in developing the case law for the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act. His precedent-setting cases involved protection of the rights guaranteed by law in that section of the Act known as the "Bill of Rights" of union members. He represented rank-and-file members in numerous cases involving issues such as eligibility for running for union office, discipline against members for criticism of their leadership, and expulsion of union members for advocating radical political ideas.

Jane Latour collected these interviews in her capacity as archivist of the Burton Hall Papers. The collection consists of interviews with rank and file insurgents, family members, representatives of union democracy organizations and others who worked with Burton Hall. The bulk of the interviews relate to Painters and Teamsters (Local 282) union reform efforts. The collection consists of audio recordings, transcripts, and contextual documentation.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Burton Hall was born in South Orange, New Jersey in 1929. He graduated from Williams College in 1951 and Yale Law School in 1954.

    <field name="bioghist_teim">Burton Hall set up his own practice in 1960 as a labor lawyer. Soon his work was almost entirely comprised of rank-and-file members suing to protect their democratic rights within their unions. His office was located at 136 Liberty Street in Lower Manhattan. When the building was demolished to make way for the World Trade Center, he moved to 401 Broadway. Hall was one of the pioneer attorneys in developing the case law for the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act.
