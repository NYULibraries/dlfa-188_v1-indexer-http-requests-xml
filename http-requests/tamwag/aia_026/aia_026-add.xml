    <field name="bioghist_teim">Thomas Gately (1828-1905), a native of Dublin, Ireland, was one of 11 children. As a child he lived with an uncle who was a draper, then in his teens shipped as a cabin boy on a sailing vessel. He emigrated to New York City around 1847. From 1850 to 1854 he worked at the Coolidge and Young distillery as the foreman of the rectifying floor, the stage at which a beverage's alcohol proof is adjusted by adding water or other liquids. He met Catherine Douglas (1835-1858), whose father owned a prosperous milk business. They were married in St. Mary's Church on Grand Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan on April 25, 1952 and eventually had three children: Margaret (1853-1854), Philip (1854-1948), and Joseph T. (1856-1905). On November 11, 1854 Gately became an American citizen.</field>
