    <field name="bioghist_teim">Alger Hiss (1904-1996) was a State Department official who served in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and was involved in the establishment of the United Nations. In 1948 Hiss was named as a communist by Whittaker Chambers in a hearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Hiss was called before HUAC to testify and later filed a defamation lawsuit against Chambers. During the trial Chambers produced evidence that Hiss and his wife Priscilla had been involved in espionage, and had transmitted government documents to Chambers in 1938. In December 1948, Hiss testified before a grand jury in the Southern District of New York that neither he nor his wife had given government documents to Chambers and that he had not spoken to Chambers since 1937. Following his statements, the grand jury indicted Hiss on charges of perjury in United States vs. Alger Hiss. Alger Hiss was represented by the New York City-based law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. His first perjury trial began in May 1949 and ended in a mistrial. The second trial began in November 1949 and ended in a conviction. Hiss served three years in federal prison. After his release in 1953, Hiss maintained his innocence and continually fought to overturn his conviction. In 1975 Hiss, with William Ruben, filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit to gain access to FBI documents related to the trials. Documents they obtained through the FOIA lawsuit formed the basis of a petition for a writ of coram nobis that Hiss and his attorneys at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton filed in 1978. The petition sought to overturn Hiss's conviction claiming that the FBI documents withheld evidence from the defense, but it was rejected in 1982.</field>
