    <field name="abstract_teim">Asian Women United (AWU) was a New York-based nonprofit organization formed in 1978. With a distinctly feminist point of view, the organization sought to support, educate and empower Asian-American women. AWU explored Asian-American women's history and culture and mobilized community women in the political arena.

The Asian Women United Oral History Collection is comprised of thirteen interviews that document the individual stories and contributions of members. I-Ting Emily Chu conducted three of the oral histories for the Fall 2008 Oral History Seminar, taught by NYU professor Rachel Bernstein. Others were taken by Chu as part of her work at the the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives.</field>
