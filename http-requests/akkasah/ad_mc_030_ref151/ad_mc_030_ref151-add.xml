    <field name="abstract_teim">An album of albumen photographs taken during a tour of Palestine in 1903. 

The Hisham Khatib Collection on the Holy Land and region is one of the largest collections of Middle Eastern photography still in private hands. It contains hundreds of 19th century original albumen photographic prints as well as many travel albums of the same period and early 20th century with hundreds of black and white photographs and postcards. The collection contains photography from dozens of photographers, but the albumen prints are mostly the work of the Bonfils family, Francis Frith, Francis Bedford, Matson photo Service, American Colony, Zangaki Brothers, and Frank Mason Good. Dr. Hisham Khatib has spent over 40 years amassing a vast and historically valuable collection of representations of the Near East, including the Holy Lands, including Palestine, Jordan, Turkey, Syria and Egypt. The artworks in this extraordinary collection include paintings, prints, maps, books, photographs, as well as postcards. A large part of Dr. Khatib's collection consists of rare photographic prints: he has over 3,000 images. See main collection http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/akkasah/ad_mc_030/</field>
