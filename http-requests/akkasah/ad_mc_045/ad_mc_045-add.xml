The photographer and author of the present album served with the "British Forces
in Iraq" RAF Command, though he is not identified by name. Mounted to the rear
pastedown, is a photograph of a caricature styled menu which had been hand drawn
by a colleague in Iraq in 1929, reveals that he was attached to the Royal Aircraft
Medical Service (RAFMS), his rank Leading Aircraftman (LAC), serving at RAF
General Hospital, Hinaidi.
At the time, RAF Habbaniya was a cantonment in the form of a tent camp,
officially called RAF Dhibban, with services such as the hospital being under
construction and expansion. Royal Air Force Station Habbaniya would be a fully
operational site from October 1936 to 31 May 1959. [Air Headquarters was
initially situated in the Old British Residency in Baghdad. The officers were
accommodated in various messes in Baghdad and the airmen in a compound at
Southgate. In December 1928 the Headquarters moved from Baghdad to RAF
Hinaidi Cantonment and was located in one block of the original RAF General
Hospital buildings. Apart from the Air Officer Commanding's staff mess, all the
AHQ personnel were then accommodated at RAF Hinaidi. Under the Anglo­Iraqi
treaty of June 1930, the RAF agreed to withdraw from Hinaidi and Mosul within
five years of Iraqi Independence. A reduced force was to reside at Sin el Dhibban
approximately sixty miles from Baghdad. Construction for the new camp named
RAF Dhibban had begun in 1934 and from 1936 flying squadrons were based
there. In January 1937 Air Headquarters and the personnel moved from RAF
Hinaidi Cantonment to the newly built RAF Dhibban, which was officially
renamed RAF Habbaniya on 31 May 1938. The Air Officer Commanding then
lived in Air House at Habbaniya.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Arab, Assyrian and Kurdish customs and trades are captured in
numerous snapshot photographs, illustrating the cultural diversities
of the people groups inhabiting Iraq, from as far north as the Dohuk
region in Kurdistan, to the bustling center of Baghdad, Basra in the
south, and the small villages in between.
The album begins in Baghdad, providing an aerial snapshot of the city, as well as
views of the tomb of Sit Zobaida, the golden domes and minarets of the al­
Kadhimiya Mosque, an arched entrance gate to a native village, local boats and
buildings on the bank of the Tigris, the Haydar­Khana Mosque which had been
utilized in the 1920s as an assembly place for revolutionaries, the ancient ruins of
the Archway of Ctesiphon, the elite Alwiyah social club which had opened in 1921
and continues to operate today, the Memorial to Lieutenant General Sir Frederick
Stanley Maude erected to commemorate the conquering of Baghdad in 1917, the
Maude bridge, and more.
The officer travelled with the Royal Air Force to Mosul, and in desolate
regions of Iraqi Kurdistan, throughout the Dohuk region, passed Sawita
[Zawita] a vast region primarily inhabited by Kurds, secondly by Assyrians though
at the time little­inhabited at all, owing to Turkey's Massacre of the Assyrians
during World War One.
An image of three nomadic men travelling in this desolate place is captioned
"Kurdish tribesmen" and serves to remind us of the short­lived Kingdom of
Kurdistan proclaimed as a semi­independent state within Mesopotamia [Iraq],
which lasted from September 1922 until July 1924, and which would result in
special rights for Kurds. [The British Royal Air Force's Iraq Command acting
on behalf of the Iraqi government in Baghdad played a part in bringing the
Kingdom of Kurdistan to an end.] It also illustrates the massive displacement of
the Assyrian community. It is also a melancholic foreshadow to the Simele
massacre which would take place some three years later, an attack on sixty­three
Assyrian villages in the Dohuk and Mosul districts which led to the deaths of some
5,000 or more Assyrians.
The views of Mosul are most nostalgic, with its pristine clay rooftops,
meandering dirt roads, wooden footbridge, and the ancient mosque and minaret of
Nebi Yunus. Much of these were recently destroyed by modern­day terrorizing
oppressors, making these photographs even more historically significant.
In the city of Basra we find rare photographs of the docks at the port of Margil and
the RAF combined hospital, as well as a street nicknamed by the English as "The
Strand" which followed Ashar Creek. Glimpses of architecture and antiquity are
shown with views of a mosque and Ezra's Tomb on the western shore of the Tigris.
Other places visited or trodden through include Zobiar [Zubair, in the Basra
Governorate] where he captures a group of men sitting outside a mosque, Hillah in
central Iraq where three views show the different types of boats on the Euphrates
river, and Amara in the east, here observing another mosque. The town of Amara
was captured by the British in 1915, and was reputed for its feudal system with
local estate­holders maintaining private militias prior to the revolution of 1958.
Remarkable photographs show the locals going about their regular lives and
working their trades in traditional fashion. Land transportation was by mule or
camel, as in ancient times. Watercraft see here include mid­sized river boats for
merchants or fishermen, and the round Arab boat called "guffa." Images show a
dhurzi [tailor], a butcher, a water carrier donning a large leather sack of sorts and
another transporting water in a two­oxen cart, a fruit merchant, a date crusher and
date merchants, a silversmith, craftsmen making all sorts of household implements, a farmer plowing his field, fishermen, and a chowkidar [watchman or gatekeeper].
The contrast in women's societal role is quite perceptible; Arab women are
frequently seen covered in full burkhas and employed only in cooking or fetching
water while Kurdish and Assyrian women are involved in more arduous
labours such as fishing and grinding corn. Indigenous crowds participate in the
Muharram festival.
Although it is apparent that the officer was most intrigued by the ways of life in
this ancient land previously foreign to him, he concludes the album with some
seldom seen views of his medical work. Exceedingly rare photographs show
interior rooms of the RAF General Hospital at Hinaidi in 1929­1930 including
the bacteriological department, pathological ward, and medicine making
laboratory, as well as a large patient's ward.
In addition, a handful of views suggest a tour of Babylon was made by a group
of officers, showing the remains of Ishtar Gate, and the Lion of Babylon while
still under excavation. [Excavation of the Lion of Babylon, a 2600 year­old black
basalt statue of a lion trampling a man, had begun only a few years before (circa
1917­1920) this snapshot was taken. Carved on a trapezium platform, it is among
the most celebrated archaeological artifacts in the history of modern Mesopotamia
since its discovery by local villagers in the early 20th Century. The irony is that the
basalt statute does not seem to be of Mesopotamian or Babylonian origin despite
the fact that it was unearthed in the heart of the ancient city of Babylon. Most
archaeologists believe that the statue is a leftover from the Hittites' presence in
Babylon who sacked the city in the 2nd millennium BC. The lion is associated in
Mesopotamian and Kurdish mythology, both with Nergal, the god of death and
of war, and with Ishtar, the goddess of love, who, in several cults, has two faces:
love and life on the one hand, war and death on the other. The U.S. Library of
Congress Matson collection holds a 1932 photograph of the Lion of Babylon which
shows that excavation continued after this album's snapshot view, further revealing
its base.]
One aerial view shows the Imam Azim mosque in Persia, when it was surrounded
by lush landscaping and tall trees [also known as the Shah­Abdol­Azim shrine,
situated in present­day Tehran province, Iran.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">British occupation of Mesopotamia (1914­1922) 
 
In 1914, the British invaded Iraq (then part of Mesopotamia) to protect their oil
interests and what began as a very limited military expedition resulted in a 44 year
military/political involvement, during which they fought a 12 year insurgency.
Their involvement suffered from intelligence failures, Sunni­Shia rivalry, a
Kurdish independence movement, a weak central government, looting and crime,
inadequate infrastructure, and so on.
Known as the Mesopotamian Campaign, fighting commenced with the Battle of
Basra in 1914 and continued for the duration of the war. The most notable action
was the Siege of Kut, which resulted in the surrender of the British and British
Indian Army garrison of the town in April 1916, after a siege of 147 days. Of
11,800 Allied soldiers who survived to be made prisoners; 4,250 died of disease or
at the hands of their Ottoman guards during captivity.
Following the British occupation of Mosul Vilayet in 1918 after the First
World War, with the assistance of British political and military officers,
Sheikh Mahmoud established a Kurdish government in Sulaimaniya. This first
Kurdish government initially had authority on Kirkuk but was soon challenged by
British officers to strip the city along with other localities in southern Kurdistan out
of the Sulaimaniya government. Sheikh Mahmoud responded by rising against
British forces in southern Kurdistan, and thus began the first Kurdish
Uprising in Sulaimaniya against British forces in May 1919, mainly due to
who controlled Kirkuk, which is today's centre of the northern Iraqi petroleum
industry
 
The Kingdom of Iraq under British Administration or Mandatory Iraq was created
in 1921 following the 1920 Iraqi Revolt against the proposed British Mandate for
Mesopotamia, and was enacted via the 1922 Anglo­Iraqi Treaty. Faisal ibn
Husayn, who had been proclaimed King of Syria by a Syrian National Congress in
Damascus in March 1920, was granted the territory of Iraq by the British. He was
to rule it as a kingdom, with the British RAF retaining certain military control,
though de facto. The territory remained under British administration until
1932. The civil government of postwar Iraq was headed originally by the High
Commissioner, Sir Percy Cox, and his deputy, Colonel Arnold Wilson. British
reprisals after the murder of a British officer in Najaf failed to restore order. The
most striking problem facing the British was the growing anger of the nationalists,
who continued to fight against the imposition of British authority.
British administration had yet to be established in Kurdistan Region in Iraq.
The Kurds also lost their ancestral lands and were annexed to accommodate
the interests of the British. This was also the case in Kurds of Turkey, Iran and
Syria.
 
 
Mesopotamia refers to the area of the Tigris­Euphrates river system, and
corresponds to modern­day Iraq, the northeastern section of Syria and to a much
lesser extent southeastern Turkey, smaller parts of southwestern Iran and Kuwait.
Widely considered to be the cradle of civilization in the West, Bronze Age
Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian
empires, all native to the territory of modern­day Iraq.</field>

Royal Air Force Station Habbaniya, more commonly known as RAF Habbaniya,
(originally RAF Dhibban) was a Royal Air Force station at Habbaniyah, about 55
miles (89 km) west of Baghdad in modern day Iraq, on the banks of the Euphrates
near Lake Habbaniyah. It was operational from October 1936 until 31 May 1959
when the British were finally withdrawn following the July 1958 Revolution.
The base was extensive and included the Air Headquarters of RAF Iraq Command,
maintenance units, an aircraft depot, an RAF hospital, RAF Iraq Levies barracks,
the RAF Armoured Car Company depot as well as fuel and bomb stores. There
were numerous billets, messes and a wide range of leisure facilities including
swimming pools, cinemas and theatres, sports pitches, tennis courts and riding
stables. It was self­contained with its own power station, water purification plant
and sewage farm. Within the base was the Civil Cantonment for the civilian
workers and their families and the families of the RAF Iraq Levies. Water taken
from the Euphrates for the irrigation systems enabled green lawns, flower beds and
even ornamental Botanical Gardens. After World War II the families of British
personnel started living at Habbaniya and a school was started"</field>
