    <field name="bioghist_teim">Officer L. Wells was attached to RAF Hinaidi, employed in a laboratory of the
RAF General Hospital at Hinaidi. A medical man, skilled photographer, and
somewhat of an artist. 
Royal Air Force Station Habbaniya was an evolving cantonment called RAF
Dhibban during this period, with services such as the hospital being near
completion. RAF Habbaniya was fully operational from October 1936 to 31 May
1959. [Air Headquarters was initially situated in the Old British Residency in
Baghdad. The officers were accommodated in various messes in Baghdad and the
airmen in a compound at Southgate. In December 1928 the Headquarters moved
from Baghdad to RAF Hinaidi Cantonment and was located in one block of the
original RAF General Hospital buildings. Apart from the Air Officer
Commanding's staff mess, all the AHQ personnel were then accommodated at RAF
Hinaidi. Under the Anglo­Iraqi treaty of June 1930, the RAF agreed to withdraw
from Hinaidi and Mosul within five years of Iraqi Independence. A reduced force
was to reside at Sin el Dhibban approximately sixty miles from Baghdad.
Construction for the new camp named RAF Dhibban had begun in 1934 and from
1936 flying squadrons were based there. In January 1937 Air Headquarters and the
personnel moved from RAF Hinaidi Cantonment to the newly built RAF Dhibban,
which was officially renamed RAF Habbaniya on 31 May 1938. The Air Officer
Commanding then lived in Air House at Habbaniya.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">
A chronicle of civilian life in Iraq during the rule of King Ghazi bin
Faisal under sustained British colonial influence, the people
seemingly unaffected by foreign presence although representing an
era of some anti­British sentiment. Nostalgic views of a beautiful
Baghdad are followed by a journey north into Iraqi Kurdistan and a
tour of Babylon, and complemented with seldom­seen views of
Hinaidi and important RAF sites to which the photographer was
connected.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">Historic scenes in and around Baghdad include civilians peacefully engaged in
their trades and long­standing customs, amidst the numerous remains of ancient
civilizations, exquisite architecture, and some contemporary development of
Western influence including an airport. The golden domes and minarets of the al­
Kadhimiya Mosque, immense ancient stone figures standing unprotected outside
the Iraq museum, the Ottoman Qushla clock tower, the Mausoleum of Sheikh
Umar Suhrawardi, Bab al­Wastani (Wastani Gate), are some of the sites captured in
photographs. All sorts of people appear in snapshot street scenes, including a
scribe offering letter writing services from an outdoor table, groups gathered at a
traditional tea house or in front of shops, elders and youngsters, Arab women with
young children, Bedouins travelling on camels, a copper smith, a snake charmer,
and some merchants. Wells is particularly fascinated by a young lady selling
fresh chipatta bread with an alluring smile. A scant few photographs are from
Basra, so indicated in the captions.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">A two ­week leave in 1935 sees the officer to the Ser Amadia rest camp in Iraqi
Kurdistan, presenting an opportunity to tour the environs, including Kurdish
and Assyrian settlements and villages in the mountainous region. Views of
Camp Amadia at the top of a rocky gorge and the means to access it, serve to
illustrate just how isolated it was. Also paying a visit to the Kurdish town of
Amadia [Amadiya], he photographs the ancient city gate, as well as a lovely
view of the dwellings made of stone walls and thatched roofs, one Assyrian
home crafted of mere tree branches and leaves, and the old minaret. [Amadia
is an ancient mountain top village and Hill station situated along a tributary to the
Great Zab river in the Dahuk Governorate of Iraqi Kurdistan and is now popular
summer resort.]
While in the Kurdistan district, he takes snapshot photos of an Assyrian village
called Haisi [more recently known as Haisse] and another called Kulava, as
well as Assyrian goat herders and Assyrian wedding celebrations. A sparsely
inhabited village located in "Paradise Alley" at the foot of the mountains is lush
with vegetation and thus well cultivated, this place being called "Teruanish." At the
quaint alpine village Sulav, he observes the waterfall with a dwelling perched at
the top of the cliff from which it flows. From Dohuk we find a scarce photograph
of a large fortress type of building, seen from the approach. Views of the river Zab
include a rudimentary wooden bridge with stone pillars. In these remote parts of
northern Iraq, several Kurdish and Assyrian people were met with, and
photographed, generally showing their costume and characteristics, their
textile works and living off the land.
A tour of Babylon's and its prized antiquities consumes three pages of the album
and is accompanied by two related ephemeral documents printed in London."</field>
