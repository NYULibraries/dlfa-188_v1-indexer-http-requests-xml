    <field name="abstract_teim">The visual material in this Archive relates to the lives of the Acton family: Arthur Acton (1873-1953), his wife Hortense Mitchell (1871-1962), and their two sons Harold (1904-1994) and William (1906-1945). These loose photographs, photograph albums, negatives, scrapbooks, postcards, as well as images on glass, had been stored by the family at random in boxes, files, drawers, cupboards, desks, hat boxes, etc. in various rooms of their residence Villa La Pietra, Florence (much of it mixed with correspondence and other papers) from around 1903 up until Harold Acton's death in 1994. The Archive includes remarkably fine early studio portraits, many cabinet card photos bearing an albumen or gelatin silver print taken at the end of the 19th century for the Mitchell family and their circle in Chicago, and some cartes-de-visite photos dating from circa 1870 of Arthur Acton's ancestors. There is a very full documentation of the Acton family's life at Villa La Pietra, including visitors to the villa, from the first years of the 20th century up to Harold's death. This is of particular interest as a documentation of the Anglo-American resident community in Florence. Travels taken in Europe and America during this time by members of the family are also well illustrated. There are numerous photographs of Harold Acton's famous circle of friends at Oxford in the 1920s. A valuable series of photographs of China and actors from the Peking Opera survive from the 1930s when Harold lived and taught in Beijing. There is also a complete documentation of the various phases of the Actons' construction of the garden of Villa La Pietra and their work on it from the very first years. Another series of photos show how the interior of Villa La Pietra has appeared over the decades, and document the various works of art which decorate the rooms or have done so in the past. Other photographs of works of art document private collections in the early 20th century, many of which have since been broken up. There are numerous photographs of works of art, purchased by the Actons for study purposes. Other photographs are of places (all over the world), and there is a particularly rich collection of images of Italian villas and gardens in Florence and Tuscany. The collection of postcards (excepting those with correspondence which have been extracted for the paper archives) is very extensive and includes many annotated on the verso documenting travels by Hortense or Harold in the first decades of the 20th century. The valuable collection of glass stereographs and autochromes includes numerous images of the family at Villa La Pietra and its garden. Professional photographs of the family in Florence include works by Nunes Vais and Cecil Beaton. There is a series of photographs of Villa Passerini in Florence, owned by Hortense Mitchell's brother Guy, dating from the first decades of the 20th century by Giuseppe and Vittorio Jacquier. There are also photographs of places in Italy by Carlo Naya (died 1882) and Giorgio Sommer (died 1914). The number of items in the Acton Photograph Archive, including positives and negatives and images on glass (but excluding postcards) is circa 16,700. Restrictions Apply.

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The collection is arranged into 10 series (and numerous subseries):</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: The Actons</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: Villa La Pietra</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series I: THE ACTONS </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A. Acton, Arthur (I.A.1.-I.A.6.) </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">(Album 1-3)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Includes prints dating from the early 1900s, some of them cabinet card photographs and studio portraits, also of AA in his apartment and studios in New York and Firenze. There are very early prints of AA in the grounds of Villa La Pietra before the gardens were laid out, and others taken over the years of him alone or with friends in the gardens (and a few of him in the interior of Villa La Pietra). The series showing him with others or of his friends include some taken at Florentine villas, and there are others of vintage cars.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. alone: Includes prints with WA. There are also a few prints without AA of the interiors of his apartments in Firenze, kept here so as not to separate them from the prints taken at the same time showing him in the same place. Also here are a few prints of AA painting, kept here for the same reason (rather than filed in I.A.6.).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. with Hortense Acton, n√©e Mitchell: For other photographs of AA with the family, see under Harold Acton (I.C.1.-I.C.5).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3. with others: Includes a few prints of AA with WA. There are a few prints here which may not include AA himself, and there may be some small overlap with I.A.4.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4. friends of Arthur and Hortense Acton: Some of the friends here were also painted by AA so may also appear in I.A.6.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">5. his relations: Prints of his father Roger Acton in Cairo include some views of Cairo without him, kept here as obviously taken at the same time. For the album of AA's ancestors, see III. A.10.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">6. his painting activity: Includes interiors of his studios in New York at the end of the 19th century, and Firenze (early 20th century) as well as portraits of sitters and models posing.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">B. Acton, Hortense n√©e Mitchell (I.B.1.-I.B.4.) </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">(Album 3-5)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many early cabinet card photos (mostly by Steffens of Chicago) show HMA as a young girl (the earliest one of her alone is securely dated 1891).There are many prints of HMA's early life in the US on family outings and trips with friends, and her Chicago girlhood friends are recorded in numerous fine cabinet card photos. There are a great many oversize prints in this series. There are early prints of HMA in the grounds and gardens of Villa La Pietra.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. alone: Includes some early (late 19th century) prints of uncertain identification (perhaps sisters or friends of HMA rather than HMA herself).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. with others: For HMA with AA, see I.A.2., and for HMA with HA (and the family) see I.C.1.-.7. The prints of a trip to the Missions in SW America ca. 1890s includes many prints of buildings and landscapes with no people, kept here since they are part of the same series taken at the same time.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3. her Chicago girlhood friends: Mostly identified as taken by photographers at the end of the 19th century.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4. her relations (the Mitchell family): For her cousin Louise Gaylord's wedding to Walter Dillingham at Villa La Pietra, with HA and WA as pages, see I.C.1. For her brother Guy Mitchell's Villa Passerini, Firenze, see V.A.1., and for the Dillingham's Villa La Pietra in Honolulu, see V.B.4.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">C. Acton, Harold (I.C.1.-I.C.16)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">(Album 6-12)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Prints of HA arranged by decade include those with his family. Lots of these were taken in the gardens or the interior of Villa La Pietra, but also in the US and elsewhere in the world, including China in the 1930s. Those with guests at Villa La Pietra include numerous Color prints of the 1970s and 1980s of unidentified visitors. Those showing HA at formal ceremonies are nearly all in Italy.</field>

The dogs include the Acton family pet dogs often photographed in the gardens of Villa La Pietra. The last two sub-series have been added here as they fit even less well elsewhere in the collection.</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Series II: VILLA LA PIETRA </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">A. The Gardens (II.A.1.-II.A.10.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">(Album 1-10 and Box 11)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The prints of the gardens have been filed by area (always indicated by where the photographer was standing), following the sub-sections of the gardens established by New York University prior to their restoration. The prints have been arranged as far as possible chronologically (although there are many instances in which the date is uncertain). This rule has in a few instances been over-ridden (for example in the Teatrino and Boschetto, Vista dell'Arco) where similar views of areas of the gardens (i.e. 'looking south' or 'looking north') have been filed together. Prints of the statuary have been filed together at the end of each sub-section, and numbered according to the inventory established by New York University prior to restoration on the gardens. Series II.A.10.ii. is a ring-binder with photos of statues in the gardens taken by Anna Marx (1986), duplicates of prints filed in II.A.1-II.A.7. but here given a different inventory number since they are filed separately. For other early prints of the gardens (including some prints of the gardens under construction in the first years of the 20th century), see also I.A.1., I.A.3., I.A.4., III.A.1., III.A.2., III.A.6., and III.B.1. There are numerous Brogi prints commissioned by the Actons in 1927, and others dating from the 1930s.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. Viale</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. Piazzale: i Corte, ii Parcheggio</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3. Vasche: i Terrazza, ii Prima Vasca, iii Scalone, iv Seconda Vasca, v Peristilio della glicine</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4. Tempietto and Teatrino: i Tempietto, ii Teatrino</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">5. Boschetto: i Vista dell'Arco, ii Vista del Duomo, iii Prato ovale, iv Vista del Colosso, v Vialone, vi Pergola delle Rose</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">6. Giardino Topiario: i Giardino Segreto, ii Vasca di Diana, iii Prato del Cedro</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">7. Pomario</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">8. the park before the construction of the gardens</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">9. the garden statuary, vases, and masques, before their present installation in the gardens</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">10. Albums of Garden Photos: i. Album 1930s, ii. Garden statues taken by Anna Marx in 1986, iii. Album of photos by Frederic Faust 1930s, iv. Album given to Harold Acton, July 1974, v. Album of Garden photos (gift of Alexander Zielcke) </field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">B. The Interior and The Collection (II.B.1.-II.E.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">(Album 12-33)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. the rooms with their contents</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">General views of each room, followed by prints of the contents, object by object. The rooms are numbered and named, following the Conti inventory in Italian, drawn up in December 1995 by Giovanni Conti. This inventory has also been used in the numbering and description of the works of art in each room, without taking into account that since 1995 the inventory has frequently been subject to revision as regards dates and attributions. The information from the Conti inventory appears where possible in italics in the Finding Aid.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. works of art from the Collection in previous displays</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">See also II.D. There may be some small overlap with II.B.1.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3. works which were formerly part of the Collection, but whereabouts at present unknown</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Arranged by paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts. Includes stolen works, and may include works formerly in villas on the estate (but see also II.C).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4. collection related works of art</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These are works of art very similar to those in the Villa La Pietra Collection (and they have been cross-referenced by the processor to the relevant object in II.B.1.). Arranged by interiors, paintings, and sculpture. For some other objects which may be related to works in the Collection, see IV.A.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">5. Historic Albums mostly of the interior and works of art at present in the Collection or probably formerly once belonging to it</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These consist of: 12 brown canvas-bound albums, mostly with the photographs pasted on to the page, and bearing their original numbers 1-3 and I-IX on the spine; 2 oversize green canvas albums un-numbered on the spine, containing photos numbered with Reali negative numbers 1-98 and 99-200; 1 oversize album, containing Color prints of the interior of Villa La Pietra in carbochrome, 1973.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The 12 brown canvas-bound albums contain prints mostly of the interior of Villa La Pietra and works of art at present in the Collection or probably formerly once belonging to it, but also contain photographs of works of art no longer in the collection, works of art now in Villas on the estate, a few of the Villa La Pietra gardens and statues, and others of works of art illustrating the Actons' activity as collectors.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The two oversize green canvas albums contain photos taken by Reali probably between 1958 and 1964 (and their numbers correspond to the glass negatives of these prints also preserved in Series X).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The pages of the albums have been numbered in pencil by the processor in square brackets to correspond with the detailed description of each album provided on a print-out kept together with the album (and included in the Finding Aid).</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The original numbering of the pages and/or photographs in the albums is usually not consecutive but has always also been recorded, and some of these appear to refer to similar numbers on Brogi photographs. Some pages are blank and some photographs are missing.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the photographs were found to be duplicates of those already in the Archive, and so this was noted in the album description, giving the archive number of the duplicate print. 'Duplicates' have been differentiated from 'Near duplicates' - the difference being that a 'near duplicate' is a print from the same negative but cropped slightly differently or printed with a different exposure.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">In the albums where the photographs were not pasted on to the page, a few of these were removed and replaced at an unknown time by photocopies, but the great majority of these were removed to the Archive in 2004 (noting on the original the provenance and Historic Album number) and replaced here with Color photocopies of the recto and verso.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The two oversize green canvas albums have photos by Reali not pasted on to the page but the originals have been left here. They are annotated by HA and numbered by him. Again the duplicates and near duplicates have been noted.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">6. Interiors taken by Anna Marx, 1986</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">These are mostly general views of rooms of Villa La Pietra, rather than individual works of art: however when an art object can be seen clearly it has been given its Conti inventory number, which is part of the title proper in Italian (in this case not in italics). Anna Marx photographed most rooms in the Villa except for III, V, VIII, XXVII, XLIV, XLVI, and L. Instead she photographed XXVI (Bagno), and XLIV (Ufficio, called by her the "Stanza della Signora Malesci"), not documented photographically elsewhere in the Archive as well as the Corridoio (XLII) in greater detail than elsewhere in the Archive.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim"> C. The Estate (II.C.1.-II.C.8.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">(Album 34-35, Box 36)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Here are views of the land (the podere) surrounding Villa La Pietra as well as views from and of Villa La Pietra. The images of the exterior and interior of the five villas on the property (Villa Emilia, Villa Natalia, Villa Colletta, Villa Sassetti, and Villa Ulivi) include works of art and historic albums of the villas.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. The Podere</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. Villa Emilia</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3. Villa Natalia</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">4. Villa Colletta</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">5. Villa Sassetti</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">6. Villa Ulivi</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">7. unidentified</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">8. Albums of the villas</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">D. Other Acton properties (II.D.1.-II.D.3.)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">(Album 37)</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">Many of the art objects photographed in these properties were subsequently part of the Collection of Villa La Pietra. Palazzo Guadagni, Firenze has been included here, but only in order to cross-reference it to the photographs of Arthur Acton in his studio in Series I.A.6. Lungarno Guicciardini, Firenze: two of these three photos are identified on the verso as 'Lungarno Guicciardini', and so were processed here, but they appear, instead, to be interiors of Villa Sassetti. Lancaster Gate was a property owned by the Actons in 1928-32. Many of the photographs are annotated by Guy Mitchell, brother of HMA, who was frequently in London between 1928-32 and WA and HA were also presumably there during that period. In these photographs there is a small overlap with II.B.1.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">1. Palazzo Guadagni, Firenze see I.A.6.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">2. Lungarno Guicciardini, Firenze</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">3. Lancaster Gate, London</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The postcards in the Archive are those without correspondence on the verso, but include some, in series VI.D. with annotations on the verso recording dates (and sometimes descriptions) of places visited. The postcards, filed topographically, are kept in folders and numbered only down to folder level. It was decided to dismantle postcard albums (where the postcards were not pasted to the page) when these included postcards with correspondence so that these could be transferred to the paper archives. The postcards without correspondence were then kept together in a folder as they had been in the album.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The postcards annotated by HA on the verso of places in the Far East have been kept in Series VII. It was decided to keep postcards of works of art and places separately and not file them in series IV and Series V, except in the case of Italian villas and gardens which have been filed in V.A.1. and V.A.2. Otherwise it was felt that it would be interesting to keep the postcards separate in this subseries as the possession of a postcard normally indicates that that place or work of art was visited or seen by a member of the Acton family. Therefore when looking for a picture of a place or work of art it may be useful to look at the postcard series also.</field>
    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The albums in series VI.E. usually contain only postcards, although a few of these could be termed scrapbooks as they include other material. Some of these were partly dismantled since if they had correspondence on the verso it was decided to remove them to the paper archives. The albums have been given a compressed description in the Finding Aid (but a more detailed description has been kept with each postcard album).</field>

    <field name="scopecontent_teim">The images on glass are always positives unless indicated as negatives. They are mostly 13 x 6 cm or 10.5 x 4.5 cm. (for larger glass negatives, see Series IX. and Series X.). Most of them are stereographs (which include positives and negatives, sometimes of the same image).

They were found in boxes accurately marked with their Reali negative numbers (sometimes also indicated on the glass plates themselves) ‚Äì the first instance in the Archive where the material was pre-numbered. These numbers have therefore been included in the photograph number, preceding the Conti inventory number which indicates which work of art is represented in the Villa La Pietra Collection (i.e. Series X., Reali negative number 1., Conti inventory number XX. B.16., Box 1., folder 1., photo 1.). Prints of almost all of the negatives exist in Series II.B.1. or II.B.5 (and cross references to these have been provided by the processor). They were probably all taken at the same time between 1958 and 1964. They are in excellent condition, and many of them were touched up with pink (probably China) using a brush to make the contrast sharper.</field>

    <field name="custodhist_teim">The visual material in this collection had been stored by the Acton family at random in various rooms of their residence, Villa la Pietra, Florence from around 1903 to the death of the last member of the family, Harold, in 1994. Some of it was mixed up with correspondence and other papers. Much of it lacked dating and identification. It was processed and given a Finding Aid in 2002-2005 by NYU with the help of a grant from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation of New York.</field>
