    <field name="scopecontent_teim">This is one of a series of canvas-bound albums where most of the photographs were not pasted on to the pages, numbered (not sequentially) on labels pasted on to the page. Those of Villa La Pietra gardens were replaced at an unknown time by photocopies: all of the originals are in the archive and the photocopies here have been given their Finding Aid number, since the originals do not bear the provenance and Historic Album number. Those of the interior and collection of Villa La Pietra were removed to the Archive in 2004 (noting on the original the provenance and Historic Album number) and replaced here with Color photocopies of the recto and verso. These have been listed below, but not identified, giving only their number on the label pasted onto the page or any annotations made on the pages. Unless otherwise indicated all the numbered labels or pages are annotated with a 'tick'. For easy reference the album pages have been numbered by the archivist in pencil on the top right-hand corner. The only photographs remaining in this album are those on page 1 and on the last page 102.</field>
